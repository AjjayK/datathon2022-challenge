78dd3665b49b53dcfc5a568d6c662fc6ffadaedf,CNN,"(CNN) -- Most have likely heard the broad outlines of the events that led to former Vice President Dick Cheney's heart transplant: Five heart attacks, open heart surgery and a battery-operated heart pump. But few are probably aware that the 72-year-old Cheney believed at one point he would not live through the night and made funeral plans with his family. That's just one of the surprising facts that I learned during an interview conducted over two days with the man widely considered to be one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history. The interview is scheduled to air Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" It will air Tuesday on CNN. Here are three things I learned during the interview: . 1. He started smoking cigarettes when he was 12 years old, and his daily staple was a dozen doughnuts and three packs of cigarettes when he was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff. He was just 34 years old. Cheney suffered his first heart attack in 1978, at age 37, while he was campaigning for Congress. It was the first of five heart attacks. He suffered subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. Cheney also underwent an open heart surgery and had a pacemaker implanted. In June 2010, he was hospitalized for conditions related to his coronary artery disease. He had a Left Ventricular Assist Device, or LVAD, implanted to help his heart pump. What's a stent? 2. In July 2010, he was convinced he was going to die. He made plans for his burial with his family, and then had a heart pump placed. That heart pump stayed in his body for 20 months until he got a heart transplant at age 71. The LVAD, a battery-operated heart pump, is basically used to buy people time -- a last resort, if you will -- while they await a new heart. Cheney waited 20 months for a transplant, twice as long as the average wait for a patient for a new heart. 3. For the entire time Cheney was vice president, he had a secret letter of resignation pending. He wrote this letter because he saw a gap in the U.S. Constitution. If a vice president is alive but incapacitated, there's nothing in the Constitution that allows for that person's removal. Worried that he might find himself in that position, he created the unprecedented letter. Cheney unapologetic in documentary . Cheney said he gave the letter to his counsel, David Addington, with instruction that it was to be delivered to President George W. Bush if Cheney were to become incapacitated. Before Cheney accepted Bush's offer to run as his vice president, he has said a team of doctors carried out a thorough evaluation of his heart. After leaving office in 2009, Cheney's appearance became increasingly frail. I saw him a few years ago, and he looked so frail that I as a doctor thought the end was near for him. Today, Cheney looks to be of normal weight and full of energy. He is walking around with no shortness of breath, and he says he can do whatever he wants except ski. That's not because of Cheney's heart. That's because of his aging knees. Dick Cheney: Fast Facts . CNN's Chelsea J. Carter compiled this report.",8,8.406268167372378
7872802b5377b47f24d3f73c5fbb956c7f5b11ba,CNN,"(CNN) -- Nicki Minaj isn't feeling welcomed at her old high school -- or at least that's what she's saying on Twitter. In a series of tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper implied that her former stomping grounds, New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High, turned down her request to speak to the school's students. ""I wanted to go back to my HS and speak to the students, but the new principal declined,"" Minaj said. ""No need for me to inspire them, I guess. ... That school changed my life and I wanted to pay it forward to the students there now. I was really looking forward to it."" The ""Anaconda"" rapper's tweets suggest the school didn't give a reason for declining her appearance. (When asked directly whether she received an explanation, Minaj tweeted, ""not really."") LaGuardia High deferred all comment to the New York Department of Education, who explained that former graduates could return to the school unless it would interrupt the students' learning. ""Of course alumni are welcome back to our campuses and we love to celebrate their success, providing it does not interrupt the educational process,"" an official for the DOE said in a statement. ""Alumni visit all the time and address students. However, we do not allow reality TV to be filmed on school property. For documentaries, any visit to a public school must be educational in nature and cannot intrude on instruction."" It isn't yet clear if Minaj's appearance would have included reality TV cameras. Minaj's reps have not responded to a request for comment. Minaj wasn't the only one disappointed by the school's response. The colorful rapper retweeted replies from disgruntled fans who took issue with the star's lack of access. ""I'm still in disbelief that the principal declined her visitation to motivate,"" said a fan. ""Does she not know how much Nicki impacts this generation?""",1,9.597782392363833
d915e41e47a169937311e8a94e4933b5fcf879ce,CNN,"(CNN) -- He played the ukelele, weighed in on the Obamacare debacle and even flashed his prehistoric flip cell phone. Suffice it to say, we got to see another side of Warren Buffett during an interview with Piers Morgan Tuesday night. Accompanied by his son and grandson, the billionaire investor gave his unique take on almost everything. And with that, he let Morgan and American take a quick peek in his wallet. Literally. Here are some of the highlights. On Obamacare and Kathleen Sebelius . Buffett has in the past supported President Barack Obama. And it seems that this support extends to embattled U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Buffett says give Sebelius some time to fix the Obamacare mess she is overseeing. ""I am a friend of Kathleen's. And I'm a friend of her when she's in trouble. I like Kathleen. I feel sorry for her in the position she's in. Obviously, it's a huge screw up but it will get worked out, "" Warren Buffet told Piers Morgan. On technology . Can you tell a lot about the wealth of a man from his cell phone? Apparently not when it comes to the 83-year-old financial guru. ""This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me,"" joked Buffett, as he revealed a Nokia flip phone, a relic compared to today's smartphones. ""I don't throw anything away until I've had it 20 or 25 years."" By the way, Buffett's son, Howard Graham Buffett, did not bring a phone to the interview. And grandson Howard Warren Buffett led the three generations when it came to technology. He had two Blackberries. Buffett's standoffish approach to technology extends to e-mail. ""I sent one e-mail in my life,"" revealed Warren Buffett. ""I sent it to Jeff Raikes at Microsoft and it ended up in court in Minneapolis, so I am one for one."" On his biggest mistake . When you are one of the richest people in the world, it is hard to say you made many mistakes. Buffett listed one. ""I bought a company in the mid-90s called Dexter Shoe and paid $400 million for it,"" Buffett said. ""And it went to zero. And I gave about $400 million worth of Berkshire stock, which is probably now worth $400 billion. But I've made lots of dumb decisions. That's part of the game."" On his wallet . Buffett says he has been carrying the same wallet for 20 years. And when Morgan asked Buffett to show America what is inside, he obliged. He whipped out the black wallet for a split second. If you blinked you missed it. The highlights: A family picture. A wad of hundreds. And an American Express card from 1964. ""It goes with the cell phone,"" Buffett joked about the almost 50-year-old credit card. On the shutdown showdown . At least one part of the recent battle between Democrats and Republicans that caused a 16-day government shutdown should never happen again, Buffett says. The battle should not take place around whether to raise the debt ceiling limit, he said. It could be catastrophic to the economy. ""I think that both parties should declare the debt limit as a political weapon of mass destruction which can't be used,"" he said. ""I mean, it is silly to have a country that has 237 years building up its reputation and then have people threaten to tear it down because they're not getting some other matter."" On investment . Who wouldn't ask the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" who made his fortune investing, for a stock tip? Fans watching the interview needled Morgan via Twitter to ask the Nebraska billionaire how he would invest $1,000 right now. Buffett's answer: ""Well you asked,"" he coyly told Morgan. ""You've done your job."" It seems investment advice doesn't come easy. ""I can't even get an answer to that question,"" Howard Graham Buffett joked. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

4d6b91f927d98511f4bc940d35b9c68ab1e34e43,CNN,"(CNN) -- CNN Hero Wilma Melville is helping rescued dogs find new life as rescuers themselves. She and her nonprofit, the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, partner shelter dogs with firefighters and train them to save lives after a disaster. Since 1996, the group has trained 131 search-and-rescue teams around the country -- for free -- and responded to 80 disasters across the world, including the September 11 attacks and the Japanese earthquake earlier this year. CNN's Lan Trinh recently spoke with Melville about the group's efforts. Lan Trinh: What characteristics make a good search dog? Wilma Melville: We look for a dog with high energy, an ability to focus. The dog has to have what we call drive. He wants a job. ... In addition to that, he has to like other dogs (and) be affectionate with humans. He has to not care about peculiar footing under his feet, slippery stuff, moving stuff. ... He has to not be noise-sensitive. And if he is startled, he doesn't run away or freak out. Trinh: In 1995, it could take three or four years to train a search dog and his handler. Your group has shrunk that training time to about a year. What are you doing differently? Melville: (People) were raising puppies with the hope that the puppy would have all the characteristics needed to become a search dog. ... I thought, ""Where can I get a dog that's about a year old with the characteristics needed in a disaster search dog? Where can I get a dog like that?"" And I thought, ""Maybe in a shelter. Maybe the Humane Society."" ... A little math will show you that if a dog can work until he's about 10 years of age, and he's 2 or 3 when he begins his job, he has maybe six or seven years of working life. At the rate that we were producing teams in 1995, they would be retiring at the same rate we were producing them. Trinh: Most of your search dogs come from shelters. What happens to dogs that get selected but don't have what it takes to make it through the entire training program? Melville: If we do take a dog into our program, we say to him: ""You have lifetime care, buddy. You've tried hard, but if one or two characteristics are missing and you can't make it through the six- to eight-month training, we'll provide lifetime care."" This means a loving home, a good home, and staying with that home and with that dog for the lifetime of the dog. Trinh: What personal satisfaction do you get from doing this work? Melville: The personal satisfaction is making a huge difference in the way dogs are trained for canine disaster search plus the quality of teams that are produced. One can accept mediocrity in a restaurant or in a retail store, but one cannot accept mediocrity in those dogs and handlers that are searching for people that are possibly alive. The window of time to locate that person alive is very small. The relief that onlookers have when a dog is searching is immense. Trinh: Do you think you have a sixth sense for dogs? Melville: (laughs) Certainly, I've been with dogs all my life. I don't remember a time that I didn't have a dog. But much of what I know has been learned and with the right attitude. ... I think the dog tries much harder to understand us than we do him. We're a little behind in that area.

d49279f38b434483267fe46354d55f4d296576a5,CNN,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Embattled Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign that, some say, shows tensions between Pakistan's civilian and military leadership are cooling down. The two met on Saturday to discuss the ""current security situation,"" presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar told CNN. A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward, as Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani convened the Cabinet's defense committee. The meetings come one day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Pakistani prime minister contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country. Officials from both countries said such a call never took place. Saturday's meeting signaled an easing of tensions between the military and the president, said retired Brig. Mehmoud Shah. ""It's a good beginning to soothe the tension that's gripping the country,"" said Shah, a military analyst. ""It shows the two sides are prepared to talk and want the democratic system to move forward."" During the prime minister's meeting with leaders, he stressed that Pakistan's sovereignty is non-negotiable, according to a news release. ""We would reject any approach that would tend to compromise our sovereignty, honor and national dignity,"" Gilani said. ""Our contribution and steadfast commitment to stability and peace at home and in our region is unquestionable and second to none. "" For Pakistan, there is a need for national unity, especially between the military and the civilian government, he said. ""Together in complete harmony with each other and other vital institutions we can change the country's destiny and accord, its rightful place in the comity of nations,"" he said. Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes. The military and the government have been locked in a tense standoff after an alleged secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army's power with Washington's help. The government denied the accusation but the Supreme Court is investigating the scandal and its findings could threaten President Zardari and his ruling party. A series of events have also added to the furor. The U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden during a May raid on a compound located only about a mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed the military. Relations became even more strained in November, after NATO forces said they mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in airstrikes near the Afghan border -- an attack the United States insists was an act of self-defense after its troops were fired upon. Pakistan's government has formally disputed the findings of the U.S. investigation into the airstrike, saying the bombardment went on long after it reported its troops were under fire. And the United States launched its first drone attack in Pakistan Tuesday after more than a month-long lull, killing at least four suspected militants.

6fcd1f6aef4848409cd834185acab4d5be4bbb2e,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hailed as India's greatest actor, he's the legendary star of Sholay and leader of the mighty Bachchan clan. CNN talked to Amitabh Bachchan, the De Niro of Bollywood, at an International Indian Film Academy event in London... ......................................... Amitabh Bachchan talks to Myleene on the green carpet at the Indian Film Awards in Yorkshire, England . CNN: Right now, it's an exciting time for Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan: Yes, I think it is. It's a great progression from where we were a few years ago, where even though we were the highest-making film nation in the world, we were looked upon with a certain amount of criticism and skepticism about our content and the way we make our films. Gradually, over the years, people have come to expect and accept that this is how we make the films, and it's all turning out to be profitable and exciting with viewers all over the world. CNN: Why do you think people had been so skeptical? Bachchan: Well, they felt that the content wasn't exciting enough, they couldn't understand the song and dance routine, they didn't like the very cliched stories or formulaic storylines, but that's the way we are. We must have song and dance in our lives; we've had it ever since the inception of cinema in India. Our stories are very social-based, very human-based. We are a very emotional nation. All our culture and tradition of over 5,000 years has come through a lot of heat and fire and eventually come out on top. That's how it is, and that's how it's going to remain. CNN: Is Bollywood escapism for the Indian people? Bachchan: You have to see it in a larger perspective. There are large numbers of people in India below the poverty line, there are large numbers of people who lead a meager existence. They want to find a little escape from the hardships of life, and come and watch something colorful and exciting and musical. Indian cinema provides that. So yes, the content of our television and our cinema is escapist in nature because we are there to provide entertainment. The select group of people who do make realistic cinema, who do make cinema perhaps a little more acceptable to the Western audience, is a very small percentage. CNN: What are the main differences between a Hollywood and a Bollywood actor? Bachchan: Conceptually we are both the same. We are all human beings, we are actors, we are put in different situations and conditions and we act. Perhaps the content of the Indian cinema is a lot more varied and diverse as compared to the ones the Hollywood actors get associated with. They more or less have a very single track presence, so to say. Indian actors, because of the format of our stories, need to be good actors, and be able to perform emotional sequences, do a bit of comedy, dance and singing, action, because all of this forms just one film. In many ways I'd say there are greater demands on Indian actors than there are on Hollywood. CNN: So do you think Hollywood actors could learn from the Bollywood actors? Bachchan: I don't know that we are worthy enough for learning something from us, but I do know that actors in India are very capable, very talented, and can be compared to the best anywhere in the world. CNN: What makes you the best actor in India? Bachchan: I don't use any techniques; I'm not trained to be an actor. I just enjoy working in films. It's more instinctive rather than anything else. I don't do the calculated rehearsed kind of approach, and I hope that I can continue that because I believe that instinct is much stronger and greater when you are performing on camera. CNN: Tell us about the upcoming remake of ""Sholay."" Bachchan: ""Sholay"" is an extraordinary film. It's the highest-grossing film and it had a great impact on our society. Obviously remaking it is a huge task. We are purely using the inspiration of the film. I am playing the baddie in the film, as opposed to one of the leading men in the original. It's a great challenge for any actor to do something different in a film. I will obviously not be playing the leading man, but it's exciting. At my age you don't get to run after the girl and win them over and fight the baddie, but I'm happy that I'm doing the negative role in this film and I'm enjoying it! CNN: Tell us about ""Sarkar 2"" -- it's becoming a bit of a family affair! Bachchan: It's a very powerful film, it takes influences from the Godfather. It's not exactly a remake, but it took inspiration from the Godfather and put it in ""Sarkar."" We are now doing ""Sarkar 2,"" which is going to have Abhishek, my son, and his wife to be, so I think it will be wonderful for the three of us to work together again. Sarkar 2 will be a much larger film, larger in concept, larger in visuals. It promises to be very exciting. CNN: Is it nice to work with your family? Bachchan: The entire filming industry in India is one big family. We all feel that way whenever we make a film: it's a very homely feeling; we all live together, eat together, move around together. It's a wonderful feeling. I don't know how Hollywood behaves, but this is how we behave, and yes, when you have members of the family working with you it makes it all the more exciting. CNN: What's next for you? Bachchan: I think that it's important that actors keep getting challenged every day. For every creative person it's a terrible moment when they say they have done all they want to do. I like to feel the butterflies in the stomach, I like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how I'm going to be able to accomplish this feat, get jittery. That hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people. I'd like to believe that tomorrow is another challenge for me. I'm sure there is lots more for me to do, because there is lots and lots of stuff still to be explored. E-mail to a friend .",7,6.474544809385566

d79ee2f1e7130e0fec79cca5f53b14e464bd6201,CNN,"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've detained the father-in-law of one of the country's most wanted drug lords. Police Tuesday morning detained Ines Coronel Barreras, 45, on drug-related charges, officials told reporters. He is the father-in-law of Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, authorities said. In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury described Coronel as a ""key Sinaloa cartel operative."" Weapons and packets of marijuana were seized in Tuesday's operation, but no shots were fired, said Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez of Mexico's interior ministry. Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007. Guzman's nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business. The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion. U.S. authorities arrested a woman believed to be Guzman's daughter in October. She was deported in December after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa. Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The high-profile arrest comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Mexico. CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.",1,6.559329969714533
772b9bad686dee0e6df6c4ee07c979ddac47378d,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama steps in front of cameras Wednesday, he'll be addressing a nation that's simultaneously war-weary and ready for more military action against ISIS; critical of Obama's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out. Those currents of public opinion, however convoluted, will shape how Obama frames his strategy for ""degrading and ultimately defeating"" the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, which Americans now believe pose a real threat and must be combated. Here's what the polling suggests Americans are listening for when Obama speaks Wednesday: . What's your plan? When Obama admitted to reporters his administration lacked a strategy for combating ISIS in Syria, Americans largely agreed with him. More than two-thirds said in CNN's most recent survey the President lacked a clear plan for dealing with the militant jihadists. Countering that perception will be Obama's main challenge on Wednesday, and aides say he'll point to both the ongoing U.S. effort in Iraq and new efforts to train and equip local forces as evidence of a clear plot to go after the terrorists. He's open to airstrikes in Syria, officials say, and wants a broad coalition of allied countries to back him up. That puts him in agreement with the nearly three quarters of Americans who say they're ready for a broader air campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Certain specifics of the Obama plan, however, may be hard to come by -- on Tuesday, the White House said Obama would offer neither a timeline for his strategy in defeating ISIS nor a price tag. ""I wouldn't expect something that's quite that detailed,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""But the President is very interested in communicating clearly with the American public about what our priorities are and what our plans include."" Analysts say whatever strategy Obama announces -- be it airstrikes, broader training, or both -- must have a clearly articulated goal. ""The biggest mistake would be not presenting a strategy that's decisive,"" said retired CENTCOM commander Anthony Zinni. ""I think he has to clearly lay out what the objectives are. If it's the destruction of ISIS, that has significant meaning."" Obama: U.S. to ""start going on some offense"" Is ISIS a threat in the United States? Americans are worried about ISIS -- two-thirds told CNN in a poll the group posed a very or fairly serious threat. The White House agrees, saying the Islamic militants could threaten ""core American interests."" But as recently as Tuesday, the White House maintained ISIS had no current plans to attack the U.S. at home. ""There is no evidence to indicate that ISIL right now is actively plotting to hit the homeland,"" Earnest said, using the administration's name for the terror group. ""It is important for people to understand that."" So without a specific looming threat, Americans will want to hear the President's reasoning for ramping up U.S. military effort against the group -- particularly after the rhetoric used to begin the last war in Iraq turned out to be false. A majority of Americans do say they were upset by the ISIS beheadings of Americans journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and Obama has warned of Western-born foreign fighters who have the potential to return to the U.S. to stage terror plots. The timing of the speech -- on the eve of the September 11 attack anniversary -- will only serve to remind Americans of how terrorism can hit at home, even as federal officials maintain there's no current risk of attacks from ISIS. And while terrorism still ranks well below the economy as the issue most important to Americans, it is rising in standing. Just two years ago only 3% of Americans said it was their top issue; now 14% say it's what they care most about. Analysis: ISIS threat to U.S. mostly 'hype' Why not have Congress approve? When Obama was last considering airstrikes in Syria -- one year ago following President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on civilians -- he scrapped his plans when it became clear Congress wasn't on board. This time around things are different. Any action Obama announces Wednesday night won't require authorization from Congress, the White House announced, though they're still looking for support from lawmakers. The past 12 months in Syria have created a new dynamic. It's now clear al-Assad isn't leaving power, having turned over his chemical weapons to international control. The terror groups that Obama predicted would gain a foothold in Syria have. And Congress is now closer to midterm elections in which a vote for broad military power could be politically harmful. That means the President will use his existing powers to go after the jihadist group which now controls land spanning the border between Iraq and Syria. The current air campaign in Iraq relies on Obama's ability to order strikes that protect American interests and help alleviate potential humanitarian crises. Airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, an option Obama is open to, would require those parameters to be broadened -- and that will require some explaining to the American people. CNN's poll showed a large majority -- 72% of Americans -- want Congress to sign off on new military force against ISIS. But even some lawmakers themselves aren't so sure. The top Democrats in Congress -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi -- both said they agreed with the White House decision to forgo Congressional approval. Related: CNN Poll finds most Americans alarmed by ISIS . Are U.S. troops heading in? The short answer is no. Obama, having been elected to office partly on his pledge to draw down the American combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, has adamantly maintained he won't be sending American troops back into war. ""You also cannot, over the long term or even the medium term, deal with this problem by having the United States serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East. We don't have the resources. It puts enormous strains on our military. And at some point, we leave. And then things blow up again,"" he told NBC News last week. ""We've got to have a more sustainable strategy, which means the boots on the ground have to be Iraqi. ... And in Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian."" But there is an asterisk. A few hundred American troops are on the ground in Iraq to advise and help the military there. Such cooperation would be extremely difficult in Syria, where the President called long ago for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.",3,4.754664733787966
93603a2e6b52f4bf2393b3ad7440d81802825f94,CNN,"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida amusement park visitors may enjoy space-themed roller-coasters, but the first vehicle they board at Orlando International Airport may be the most futuristic ride of their vacation. Four hydrogen shuttle buses are part of the fleet at the Orlando International Airport. The airport is testing four Ford shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline. ""It's quiet, it doesn't shake like diesel, it doesn't have that diesel smell,"" said Rafael Sanchez, who has been driving the vans for a year. The quieter engine makes conversation inside the bus easier than in conventional vehicles. ""Hydrogen is one of the many technologies we are exploring, trying to become more of a green airport,"" said Ronald Lewis, director of airport operations. Vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines. The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells. The modified engines aboard the Ford E-450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter V-10s. The airport's fleet also includes three gas-electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses. The facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel. But like many experiments with alternative fuels, the price is very high and the long-term outcome is unknown. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use. Energy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up. ""It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,"" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years. The Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop. Lapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels. At the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. ""We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,"" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project. During a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump. Because a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured. ""We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,"" said Verma. ""This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet."" ""The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,"" Verma said. ""The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture, but they consume a lot more hydrogen."" Verma said the buses are ""valid transition technology"" aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen, which would then justify an expensive infrastructure. The hydrogen test project also includes the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, Ford Motor Company, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Progress Energy and SeaWorld. Hydrogen buses began shuttling SeaWorld employees in February from the park's outer parking lots to their workplaces. ""The environment is really an important part of SeaWorld's culture here,"" said Kelly Bernish, director of environmental health and safety at Busch theme parks SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica. Bernish described the venture as another opportunity for ""employees to feel like they can impact the environment by using this kind of vehicle, that will lessen our footprint on the world."" SeaWorld's Discovery Cove animal training supervisor Jay Tacey said ""somebody has to get the ball rolling. Until somebody takes that first step, there's always going to be the 'what if?' "" Airport Operations Director Lewis said being in on the hydrogen experiment early could pay off in the long run. ""We are hopeful that since they built the facility here, the only one in the southeast United States, that there will be a long-term usage for it.""",2,8.337964188669526

5c35d5467f9e94ac135aa406e77ac7ed39e96e3d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Spain's football duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona has become so dominant that sponsors have lost interest in backing other Spanish clubs. ""Having two monsters like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, the world's leading concert in football, overshadows the other clubs,"" financial expert Jose Maria Gay de Liebana told CNN. ""Sports sponsorship companies are more inclined to be the third or fourth sponsor of these two great clubs, Barcelona and Madrid, rather than be the first sponsor of a club without universal screening,"" he added. Gay de Liebana told CNN that the apparent advantage of having global brands in the top tier of Spanish football -- known as La Liga -- is in fact a serious detriment to many clubs. According to Forbes Magazine's 2012 rankings, Real Madrid is the richest club in the world by revenue -- $695 million -- and second only to Manchester United in market value. Burden . Meanwhile, Barcelona -- widely recognized as the best football team in the world with a pedigree of stars such as Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta -- is the second richest club in the world by revenue. Gay de Liebana says the presence of these two football behemoths combined with billions of euros of debt - estimated at $4.5 billion for Primera Division teams -- and liabilities has meant Spanish football clubs can no longer cope with this burden. Traditionally local governments in Spain have had a role to play in the financial management of football clubs. In the past, teams such as Valencia and Madrid, as sporting institutions, have received subsidies from local authorities, according to Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. But in the current economic climate, state investment in football clubs is not a high priority for many politicians as the central government in Madrid grapples with a spiralling national debt and chronic unemployment of over 25%. Spain -- the eurozone's fourth largest economy -- is likely to be the next bailout casualty of the debt crisis in the 17-nation currency union. The government in Madrid has already requested a rescue package for its ailing banks, which require almost 60 billion euros ($76.4 million) in support following an audit in September. Real Oviedo's plea . Further down the feeding chain of Spanish football the financial situation is even more dire -- so much so that one Spanish club in the third division -- Real Oviedo -- has turned to football fans for help. Earlier this month the Asturias-based team launched a campaign, whereby fans could effectively buy shares at approximately 11 euros [$13] each in exchange for a token stake in the club. Word of Real Oviedo's plight went viral on Twitter and football fans across the globe responded by purchasing shares and raising more than one million euros ($1.2 million) in nine days. Gay de Liebana argued that the current state of Spanish football clubs is the result of poor financial regulation and supervision. When asked whether other teams might also stand on the precipice of extinction, he said: ""I absolutely know it will happen... The next few months -- and I hope I am wrong -- will be tragic for some clubs.""",7,10.048664287102875

90561542ceb4ea225f09adc95142a922d6e5184a,CNN,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just like any other first family in the world, North Korea's secretive Kim dynasty is often the focus of gossip and rumors, especially in neighboring South Korea. There was a lot of speculation after a recent report that Kim Jong Il's grandson, identified as 16-year-old Kim Han-sol, was scheduled to enter an international school in Bosnia. Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school's Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party. In another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim's nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual. ""The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical,"" it said in a statement. According to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family's most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001. The South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be ""related (to the Kim family)."" CNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media. There are no known public photographs of Kim Han-sol and there's been no comment from the Kim family. The reclusive nature of the family leaves media outlets to leap at whatever opportunity they can to gain more insight into the lives of the Kim Jong Il family. Experts have commonly used photos released by the North Korean state-run news agency to speculate on the health of Kim Jong Il, examining facial color, posture, and even the style of shoes the leader is wearing. But the lack of access to verify most of what is circulated in the news has also led to blunders in the past. A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader's sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man. The incident was only corrected after the man in the photo spoke out saying he was shocked to see he had turned into a Kim dynasty member overnight. As the latest round of speculation continues, the YouTube account reportedly linked to the grandson is no longer accessible and has been closed.",6,8.144210154753555
52360d8b06ad5db7b518b4c9192034915ba0e8e6,CNN,"San Diego (CNN) -- I bet it sounded like a good idea at the time. Now, not so much. ""It"" was the ill-conceived decision by GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry to hitch his wagon to the clownish Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an opportunist who in recent years has taken to rounding up illegal immigrants and parading them outside his jail to catch the attention of television cameras. How did Perry get mixed up with that circus? Simple. The Texas governor got into a political scrape, and made the mistake of overcompensating. He was looking for quick validation from his party's nativist fringe because he had gotten hammered by GOP rivals for signing, in 2001, a reasonable bill in the Lone Star State that allows illegal immigrants who go to college to pay what other residents pay: in-state tuition. In fact, Perry didn't just sign that bill. He defended it and defiantly said he'd sign it again. Worse, in one debate, he told Republicans who disagreed with the measure that they didn't ""have a heart."" Good for him. Yet, after that, his poll numbers plummeted. In a futile attempt to get them up again, Perry underwent a radical makeover. He said that, if elected president, ""My policy will be to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend."" Ah, governor, you mean the ones you're not helping put through college? Perry even did penance by making a pilgrimage to the desert where he asked Sheriff Joe for his support. He got it. Just a few weeks ago, Arpaio announced he was endorsing Perry and he even went to New Hampshire to help him campaign. ""The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry,"" Arpaio said in a statement. ""I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego."" Now, America's toughest sheriff is busy fending off allegations of discrimination and racial profiling. Such is the result of a three-year investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. At issue: their clumsy handling of something they never had the know-how or skills set to do: immigration enforcement. The DOJ's report packed a punch. It accused Arpaio's office of maintaining a ""pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos"" that ""reaches the highest levels of the agency."" It accused the sheriff's deputies of routinely engaging in ""unconstitutional policing"" that includes racially profiling Latino drivers, illegally detaining and arresting Latinos and carrying out military-style immigration patrols sparked by racially tinged citizen complaints. It said that inmates in the county jails who don't speak English are often punished and denied critical services. Finally, it also charged that the leaders of the agency have an odious practice of using their power to retaliate against critics. None of this will come as a shock to Maricopa County's growing Latino population, which has been complaining of abuse by Arpaio and his deputies for several years. Following the report's release, the Department of Homeland Security immediately terminated its 287(g) agreement with the Sheriff's Office and denied it access to the federal databases that it is practically forcing upon other agencies to locate illegal immigrants under the controversial Secure Communities program. As someone who lived in Phoenix in the late 1990s and wrote columns for the Arizona Republic newspaper, I've known Arpaio and written about him for nearly 15 years. I prefer the original version. Back then, the sheriff said that his office should not waste limited resources enforcing federal immigration law. By contrast, Joe Arpaio 2.0 seems to take shortcuts that run afoul of the Constitution. Just because a media hungry lawman is hunting for illegal immigrants doesn't mean he can single out Latinos -- including the U.S.-born, some of whose families have lived on this side of the border much longer than Arpaio's ancestors have lived on this side of the Atlantic. Next, Justice Department officials will try to strike an agreement with Arpaio to implement a plan that fixes what is broken, one that can be enforced by a judge. The officials are giving the Sheriff's Office 60 days to come up with a solution or face litigation. Those who defend Arpaio and brush aside concerns over racial profiling will likely say that it's appropriate for law enforcement officers to put extra scrutiny on Latinos since most illegal immigrants in the United States are Latino. The last statement is true enough. But just because most illegal immigrants are Latino doesn't mean that most Latinos are illegal immigrants. Besides, the opponents of illegal immigration always want to convince us that they're colorblind. That argument gets hard to make when the apologists for racial profiling start defending the idea of singling out people of one ethnicity. So what did Perry do when the Justice Department report came out? The worst possible thing. He doubled down on his bad judgment. He had already made two mistakes in snuggling up to Arpaio and accepting his endorsement. He went for three by defending Arpaio. ""I would suggest to you that these people are out after Sheriff Joe,"" Perry told reporters. ""He is tough. And again, when I'm the president of the United States, you're not going to see me going after states like Arizona or Alabama, suing sovereign states for making decisions."" Even if those decisions are bad? This is not a good sign for Perry. We need a president who has character and courage, and he showed both of those qualities early in this campaign. But we also need a president with judgment, and the ability to stop and change course when they take a wrong turn. For Rick Perry, that wrong turn occurred in the Arizona desert, near the intersection of ambition and fear. And now a once-promising candidate has lost his bearings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.",1,9.502701289770723

The ""Lone Survivor"" actor is being charged with felony aggravated assault and intoxication, prosecuting attorney Ryan Stack of the Summit County (Utah) Attorney's Office said Thursday. Legal papers allege that Hirsch had a verbal and physical altercation with Daniele Bernfeld -- a Paramount executive -- at TAO nightclub in Park City during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in January. The early morning altercation reportedly involved Hirsch putting Bernfeld into a chokehold so forceful that she ""couldn't breathe"" and caused her to black out. Two bystanders pulled Hirsch off of Bernfeld before police arrived. Some ""redness"" was seen around Bernfeld's neck, according to authorities. The incident happened after Hirsch allegedly confronted Bernfeld, calling her a ""rich kid"" and questioning why she looked ""so tough."" Hirsch reportedly admitted to being in a verbal confrontation with Bernfeld and that he had consumed three to four drinks that evening. He also claimed that he did not know Bernfeld personally. That's not quite the same story he's sharing now. According to Hirsch's lawyer Robert Offer, he consumed an ""enormous amount of alcohol that night"" and has since checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, where he currently remains. Offer says Hirsch has no memory of what happened at the time of the allegations but is ""devastated"" over the incident.

ec732e1bc7f2ff6a4fd99d12762733e60e405d4b,CNN,"(CNN) -- It was 1981, and Cindy Morgan was filming what she was told would be a half-live-action, half-cartoon for Walt Disney Pictures on a completely black movie set. The director, Steve Lisberger, came up to her and told her that she was going to be flying a ""solar sailer"" ship, and at another point, she would cross a bridge -- two things that she didn't see in front of her. ""I asked him, 'What the hell is going on?' and he showed me these great Syd Mead graphics,"" Morgan said. Mead, an industrial designer, was in charge of special effects for the movie, called ""Tron."" It would be the first time that an entire world was created with computer animation. Twenty-eight years later, the movie, which cost a reported $17 million to make, has spawned a sequel, ""Tron: Legacy,"" with a much larger budget. What is it about this movie -- considered a box office flop at the time (it made $33 million, according to boxofficemojo.com) -- that made fans at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con go wild to get a surprise look at ""Legacy"" test footage? Interest has certainly remained high through the years. ""Wherever I would go in the world, no matter what language they spoke, the word 'Tron' would come up,"" said Bruce Boxleitner, who played the character of Tron and returns in the sequel. ""The computer culture was just starting up when we did 'Tron.' There was no internet,"" said Jeff Bridges, star of both films. ""I think [the fans are] guys who were raised on video games, and have a fondness for it."" You could certainly say that iReporter David Fike has a fondness for the ""Tron"" video game. ""Anytime I went anywhere with a 'Tron' arcade game, I was begging my parents for quarters,"" he said. Decades later, Fike owns an arcade console of his own, purchased at an auction. ""It had been in a Wal-Mart for most of its life and had some nicks and scratches,"" he said. ""I'm trying to restore the cabinet and get it as close as I can to making it look somewhat new."" And, of course, the movie has a special place in his heart. ""This was the first movie inside of a video game, so something sparked the imagination and fascinated me. It's probably still my favorite movie of all time despite how badly people reflect on it now,"" he said. Fike theorizes that, ""It was so different, and so ahead of its time that people just didn't get it."" Most people even somewhat familiar with the original movie remember the suits worn by characters inside the computer. ""The costumes were unbearable, there was no eating lunch in those things,"" Morgan said. Even so, the original movie's suits are a favorite among fans, no more so than iReporter Jay Maynard, who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and ""Tosh.0"" as ""Tron Guy."" ""What got me interested at the time the original came out was that I had just begun working as a mainframe systems programmer,"" Maynard said. ""I had always been interested in computers. This was the first time anyone tried showing what went on inside a computer."" Maynard isn't alone in being inspired by the movie in that way. At conventions, Morgan said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of ""Tron."" Fellow iReporter Joe Machos, a data processor at an insurance company at the time (not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie), saw the movie on opening day, July 9, 1982. ""I left that theater, as one might say, rapt,"" he said. ""It had taken me to another place."" He noted how, with its use of terms like RAM, ""rezzing,"" and ""end of line,"" it was far ahead of its time. ""It accurately predicted a future. We now have this thing called cyberspace. When you say that now, it resonates with people."" Machos also is a hard-core fan of all things Disney. During a trip to Disney's Tomorrowland, he left a comment with a woman who worked there asking, ""Where's 'Tron?'"" According to Machos, she asked him, ""Wasn't that a box office failure?"" Machos then pointed to an image from ""Fantasia"" -- which didn't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying, ""That was, too."" iReport: A chat with the cast of ""Tron: Legacy"" With the imminent release of the sequel, fans have been clamoring for a Blu-ray version of the original, which is quite difficult to find on DVD (Netflix's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on ""moratorium""). According to Disney, earlier DVD releases are simply out of circulation and a Blu-ray version that Lisberger is personally overseeing will be available early next year. ""What I think Disney is doing is smart,"" said Machos, who thinks it's a good idea to re-establish ""Tron"" for a new generation. He plans to be at the first midnight screening in costume. iReport: Jeff Bridges' ""zen thing"" in ""Tron: Legacy"" Aside from the technological, early cyberpunk aspects of ""Tron"" and other themes (Morgan sees a spiritual component to it; both films have something of a religious subtext), another explanation for its long-standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before. ""The recognizers, those giant staple looking things, I thought those were crazy cool,"" said iReporter Steve Hungsberg. ""I saw the new movie being promoted at Comic-Con and I bought one of each of the recognizer toys there. I also got one for my son. The recognizer was by far the coolest."" Fike hopes that ""Tron: Legacy"" will continue that tradition. ""I hope the disc battles are as epic as everyone that's already seen it is saying."" Just before catching a sneak preview of the movie, Maynard said, ""Everything that I've seen about the new film has impressed me immensely."" No matter the reason, there's just something about ""Tron."" As Morgan put it, ""Technology was no longer something dull and dry, technology became magical.

65015eb1ae3520da2bd0ad32c224632cfa53f2d6,CNN,"(CNN) -- President Obama seems determined to launch a two-front war with the new Republican Congress. The bigger news has been about his threatened executive order on immigration. The White House, however, has also indicated a determination to greet the new Senate majority leader from coal country with a series of very expensive environmental regulations necessitated by the climate agreement he announced with China. Before he takes these steps, President Obama should take a few days off and read a couple of books about President Woodrow Wilson's last two years in office. There are a lot of parallels between the two presidents. Both were college professors. Both liked to hide on a golf course (Wilson holds the record having played more than 1,000 rounds as President). Both were powerful orators. Both had deeply held convictions. Both disliked the Congress. The collapse of the Wilson presidency after the 1918 midterm defeat is a cautionary tale for President Obama. Republicans gained 25 seats in the House and five seats in the Senate, enabling them to control the Senate by a narrow 49-47 margin. Wilson did not seem to realize how powerful that Senate control was, even if by a close margin. He also did not realize how deeply senators feel about their prerogatives and constitutional authority. Obama determined as ever to bypass Congress . Wilson's reaction to the new Republican Senate was to defy it. He went off to the peace conference of Versailles which ended World War I with no Republican senators in the delegation. He wrote the League of Nations treaty (the forerunner to the United Nations) refusing to compromise with Republicans in the Senate. When the Republicans insisted on adding some limitations to the treaty, Wilson fought them. He went to the country and launched a nationwide speaking tour. The tension and exhaustion led him to collapse with a stroke on October 2, 1919. The incapacitated president was protected by his wife, who in effect ran the administration until he left office. The American people repudiated Wilson by an enormous margin in the 1920 elections. Republican Warren Harding won 404 electoral votes and more than 60% of the vote. In the House, Republicans gained 62 seats for a 302-131 majority. In the Senate, Republicans gained 10 seats for a 59-37 majority. President Wilson had presided over the destruction of the Democratic Party -- and it did not become competitive again until the Great Depression a decade later. President Obama seems determined to reject the American people. He set the terms for this election on October 2 at Northwestern University when he declared that his ""policies were on the ballot."" The American people took him at his word and defeated Democrats at every level. When the President's party loses the Senate, additional seats in the House, a number of governorships, and almost 300 state legislators, the American people have spoken. Republicans today have more state legislators than any time in the party's history. Republicans also control more state legislative bodies than any time in their history. Republicans have very likely tied and may surpass their post World War II high-point in membership in the U.S. House, making Speaker Boehner the most successful Republican Speaker in electoral terms since Longworth in the 1920s. If the president's opponent reaches those kind of high-water marks after a 160-year history, something big is happening. Pollster Kellyanne Conway reports  that 74% of last week's voters wanted President Obama to work with Congress rather than unilaterally issue an executive order on immigration. Gallup reports that 53% of the American people want the new GOP Congress to set priorities while only 36% favor President Obama setting the priorities. This is a striking decline for the President from 2012 (Obama is down 10 percentage points and Republicans are up 11 points in two years). If President Obama defies the will of the American people, he will destroy the Democrats' chances in 2016. Democrats in 2014 had to hide from Obama. By 2016, at this rate, they will have to repudiate him. That would all but guarantee their party's defeat, with a party descending into internal strife and the pro-Obama hard-liners fighting with anti-Obama Democrats who just want to survive. Hillary Clinton would find it a nearly impossible environment for a campaign. There are more immediate consequences to an Obama war on Congress. The Congress will fight back, and the Congress has more tools to fight with than the President does (the spending power, committee hearings and oversight power, and taking votes, to name a few). Congressional tools are so extensive and so misunderstood that they deserve their own column. It will be interesting to see how the White House reacts to the new Congress. Outgoing majority leader Harry Reid has protected the President from a lot of difficult choices by controlling the Senate so tightly. As a result, President Obama and his team may not even fully understand the disaster they could be creating by declaring war on Congress. Reading of Wilson's catastrophic experience might temper the Obama White House. If not, the new Republican Congress will defeat it. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",3,12.315345847535463
973c620a6ef5c4d14a13c5c839af20e643bda7ba,CNN,"(CNN) -- A couple years ago, a Microsoft researcher named Gordon Bell embarked on a personal experiment: He would wear a video camera around his neck all the time and keep this ""life recorder"" always turned on, so it would record everything he did. It was like an external memory drive for his brain, he wrote in a book called ""Total Recall."" Sounds pretty sci-fi, right? Not so much. The ""real-time sharing"" updates Facebook announced Thursday aim to do something quite similar -- only for the Internet instead of in real life. Before we get into the details and implications, here's a ""real-time"" example of how the updates, which are rolling out in the coming weeks, will work: As I write this, I'm listening to the band LCD Soundsystem on an Internet music service called Spotify. Because I've updated my Facebook page (here's a TechCrunch article on how to do that if you're interested) and because I've logged in to Spotify with my Facebook identity, every song I listen to is automatically shared to Facebook. Suddenly, my listening experience isn't private. It's public. All my Facebook friends are watching. And judging. Chances are this will affect people's behavior online. If you're a closet fan of Lady Gaga or Bjork or Enya (I'm all three), then you'll just have to stop listening to those potentially mockable artists -- either that, or all your Facebook friends will be chiming in with comments: . ""OMG, you're listening to that?!"" In the old world of Facebook, I would have to click that I ""liked"" a song for it to show up on my Facebook profile page. That's something you have to think about: ""OK, I really like this song, and I really want all of my friends to know that I'm listening to it right now."" Now, sharing is both passive and automatic. It's a choice you make in advance -- one time -- and never again. And so it goes with all kinds of the new ""real-time"" apps. Since I've logged in to Yahoo! News with Facebook, every time I read an article on that site, it goes to my Timeline. The same is true for Hulu and TV shows. And for the Internet game ""Words with Friends."" When I play a Scrabble-style word in that game, it will show up on Facebook, along with an image of the current playing board. For Facebook, this is obviously a good thing. The site's goal -- as postulated in ""Zuckerberg's Law"" -- always has been to get people to share more and more information about themselves. That's bound to happen in this new auto-share era. It's also ostensibly good for makers of Facebook apps. In a presentation in San Francisco on Thursday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said he was initially skeptical of the deal, since it would give Facebook so much information about Netflix's customers' preferences for movies and TV shows. He decided it was smart, however, after he used the real-time app integration for himself and decided it was so addictive that it would doubtlessly result in more people watching more videos on Netflix -- a good thing for him, of course. But the benefits for Facebook users are less clear. Tech bloggers and analysts worry these automatic, real-time updates will kick off a new level of oversharing. If you were sick of hearing about what your aunt had for breakfast and who your co-workers had ""friended"" on Facebook, wait until you know every single song they've listened to and every single movie they've watched. ""It's not hard to imagine Facebook sharing more than doubling after the f8 launches,"" Liz Gannes wrote at the blog AllThingsD. ""Millions of tiny little actions are going to move from implicit to explicit. You can start to see why Facebook enabled its 'ticker' news feed earlier this week (that's the dizzying real-time stream that many users have been complaining about). There's going to be a ton of information flying by."" With every one of these ""passive"" shares, users are teaching Facebook a little more about themselves. That's incredibly valuable to advertisers, who can use that data for target marketing. It's also a potential invasion of privacy, Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology writes at The Daily Beast. ""Since a one-time click will grant a persistent permission to any app to collect and disclose personal information on your behalf, Facebook will have to make sure its users fully understand the implications of these new apps before roll-out, or risk another round of privacy backlash,"" he says. Brookman sides with Facebook on the changes, though. ""For Facebook, of course, the point is for you to provide them more data about your life, which they can use to serve you ads you'll be more likely to engage with (which makes them more money). But there's potentially real value here too, if people can discover ways to share their music-listening and cooking habits with friends in a perhaps lighter-touch way."" Passive sharing isn't a privacy invasion, but it is ""killing taste,"" Farhad Manjoo wrote at Slate. ""Why do you share a story, video, or photo? Because you want your friends to see it. And why do you want your friends to see it? Because you think they'll get a kick out of it,"" he says. ""I know this sounds obvious, but it's somehow eluded Zuckerberg that sharing is fundamentally about choosing. You experience a huge number of things every day, but you choose to tell your friends about only a fraction of them, because most of what you do isn't worth mentioning."" The MIT Technology Review notes that Facebook tried something like this in 2007. It failed. ""The new features may prove controversial,"" Tom Simonite says. ""In some ways they resemble Beacon, a failed project from 2007 in which sites like Amazon automatically posted updates to Facebook when a person bought something. Beacon was canceled after public protests over a lack of privacy controls."" We'll see how the public reacts to what Zuckerberg calls ""real-time serendipity"" when these changes launch in a few weeks. But if these changes stand, and if people do sign up for these new-new Facebook apps with auto-share built in, then all of us may soon have a semi-public record of everything we do online. Just like Bell, the researcher with a camera around his neck.",6,7.121595013211984
9bb9bc764065359ca697e038d34446f654c4dff9,CNN,"(CNN) -- The board of News Corp. has agreed to split the conglomerate into two pieces, with one company encompassing its television and film assets and the other holding its publishing entities, according to The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp. The split is expected to be formally announced Thursday, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal. The move would separate the 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox broadcast network and Fox News Channel from newspapers and book publishing, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, in which the proposal was first reported. News Corp.'s publishing unit includes newspapers such as The Times of London and The New York Post. Its book publishing assets include HarperCollins. News Corp. is controlled by media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has been grappling in recent months with criminal investigations into his company over allegations of hacking into people's phones and improper collusion with British police.

Mourners kneel and pray to the dead as they face the devastated valley of Shiao Lin. Ma, who has faced heavy criticism from victims of the disaster, ruled out resignation, insisting his government did its best in the face of difficulties, however he pledged an investigation into any irregularities. ""Certainly, I will take full responsibility whatever the blame is because, after all, I am the president of this country,"" Ma told CNN, saying heavy rains grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief. ""Once the weather was good -- that is the 14th of August -- we were able to evacuate 2,518 people. It's a record,"" he said. Hundreds of people still await rescue in remote areas of Taiwan, where torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have hampered relief efforts. Washed-out roads and collapsed bridges have made some rescue operations impossible . Touring disaster areas, Ma has been confronted by angry survivors, and even provoked a scuffle when he opened a weekend baseball game as protesters demanded he step down. Ma has offered apologies and promises to do better. ""We will find out not only to correct the mistakes but (also) to punish the people responsible,"" he said. Rescue efforts were ongoing Sunday with military helicopters bringing stranded villagers to their waiting relatives.  Watch rescue efforts in Taiwan » . Others, waiting days in anguish for word on their loved ones, lashed out in anger. ""Local officials don't care,"" one man said. ""There are still people there and they don't do anything.""

Watch mourners call home souls of the dead » . Morakot hit the island last weekend, dropping 2.6 meters (102 inches) of rain. Before it roared on to mainland China on Sunday, the storm killed at least 123 people in Taiwan. The death toll could climb to more than 300 after more villagers buried by mudslides and floodwaters are found, Taiwan officials have said. Southern and central Taiwan were hardest hit by the storm. Mudslides inundated some places in the south, including the village of Shiao Lin, where 160 homes were lost. Authorities believe hundreds of people could be trapped under five stories of mud in the village. International aid efforts were mobilizing on Sunday, however these were complicated by diplomatic pitfalls in the face of China's territorial claims over Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province awaiting reunification. The U.S. military has begun a ""modest"" humanitarian aid mission to Taiwan with the dispatch of a Marine Corps C-130 cargo plane carrying plastic tarpaulins for shelter, U.S. defense officials said. Also Sunday, the USS Denver was en route to the Taiwanese coast with additional humanitarian aid and water purification capabilities, the officials said. The Navy ship is expected to arrive Monday, but officials could not say when it will launch its heavy-lift helicopters to drop the aid. Sources in Washington have said in providing aid to Taiwan, the United States must be sensitive to its territorial relationship with China.

3a999c065c7f86372b608ff27e6ad4deb3f7b2e5,CNN,"DOVER, Delaware (CNN) -- It was a very public goodbye for Joe Biden on Friday as the Delaware senator addressed the deployment ceremony of his son's National Guard unit as they prepare to leave for a tour of duty in Iraq. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses the deployment ceremony Friday. Following Thursday night's debate with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in St. Louis, Missouri, Biden flew back to Delaware to spend the day with his 39-year-old son before his deployment to Iraq. Beau Biden -- a captain in the National Guard and Delaware's attorney general -- will be a trial counselor in the 261st Signal Brigade, a unit that specializes in providing communications for the military in Iraq. ""I've come here many times before as a Delawarean, as a United States senator,"" he told a crowd in Dover. ""But today I come, as you prepare to deploy, as a father -- a father who had some sage advice from his son this morning: 'Dad, keep it short, we're in formation.' "" ""My heart is full of love and pride. ... You are the best demonstration of both our nation's greatness and ... our people's goodness,"" he added.  Watch more of Biden's comments » . Biden joined the rest of Delaware's congressional delegation and the state's Gov. Ruth Ann Minner in speaking to the 110 members of the unit. ""Let me simply say, thank you, thank you for answering the call of your country. ... So stay strong, stand together, serve honorably ... may God bless you and may he protect you,"" Biden added, later saluting the crowd. Beau Biden doesn't ship out right away. Instead, he heads to Fort Bliss, Texas, this weekend, where his National Guard unit completes assigned tasks and receives additional training specific to the conditions in Iraq. Then, in six to eight weeks, they ship out to Iraq. Despite increased interest and security because Biden is now a vice presidential nominee, the public affairs officer for the unit had insisted the ceremony would be no different, and not political. Lt. Col. Len Grattieri said Wednesday that the last time Biden -- who has often spoken at deployment ceremonies -- addressed a departing unit was 18 months ago, and that he usually roots his remarks in foreign policy, offering his perspective on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Grattieri couldn't say where Beau Biden will be based, but his role will be that of a prosecutor enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He added that positions aren't clearly defined, and the unit will do whatever the Army needs it to. In the past week, Biden had been trying to balance debate prep with family time. On Tuesday afternoon, he took a break and went out to lunch with Beau, Beau's wife, Hallie, and the couple's young daughter. Aides say it's been a tough week for Biden, with Beau's departure weighing on him. Biden said in an interview Tuesday that he is proud of his son, but wishes he weren't going. Palin, along with Biden, brought up their respective sons' deployment to Iraq during the debate. Palin's son Track, 19, an infantry soldier, was deployed to Iraq with his Army unit September 11. Palin spoke at her eldest son's deployment ceremony in Alaska, which honored the 4,000 Alaska-based troops to be deployed from Fort Wainwright to Iraq in the coming weeks. Track Palin, who was standing in formation among members of the 1st Stryker Brigade's 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, went unmentioned by the governor in her brief remarks. Palin had agreed to speak at the deployment ceremony several months ago, before she was tapped as Sen. John McCain's running mate. Though the speech wasn't a political event -- media credentials were issued by the military base -- that didn't stop dozens of national reporters and photographers from descending on the military base in Fairbanks, home to nearly 12,000 soldiers and their families. ""As you depart today,"" Palin told the infantrymen, ""don't mind us -- your parents, your friends, your family -- if we allow for a few tears, or if we hold you just a little close once more before you're gone. Because were going to miss you. We can't help it. We are going to miss you."" Palin said victory in Iraq is ""within sight."" ""You and others like you will be there to see the mission through,"" she said. ""You will be there to win. You will see victory. Track Palin signed up to join the Army on September 11, 2007. During his 12-month deployment, his unit will protect reconstruction teams that are rebuilding the country, said Maj. Chris Hyde, the public affairs officer for the brigade. Hyde, who called Track Palin ""a low-profile individual,"" said he had not heard any security concerns about having the son of a prominent political figure in the brigade. ""The decision to put him in that role was made before Gov. Palin was picked by McCain,"" he said. ""If anything comes down from headquarters, we will comply, but I wouldn't even want to speculate. I wouldn't say yes or no. That's just my opinion. We will do well with Track Palin whether he's there or he's not.""

b1811730f86667112896464dc84420b71e4126ea,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Controversial Dutch filmmaker Geert Wilders condemned as ""crazy and cowardly"" Britain's refusal to let him enter the country Thursday. Geert Wilders shows his passport and boarding pass at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport before leaving for London. Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker who produced a much-criticized film about Islam last year, flew to London for a screening of the movie despite being told a day earlier he would not be admitted. ""I still believed and hoped that they would change their tune,"" he told CNN by telephone, saying he was speaking from a detention room at London's Heathrow Airport. He said he was met by customs officers as soon as he left the plane. ""They took me to a detention center,"" Wilders said, and there he was interviewed ""for 45 seconds"" before they took his passport and left.  Watch Wilders condemn British government » . He called it a ""very sad day"" for ""freedom of speech in the European Union."" Wilders had been invited to screen his film, ""Fitna,"" at the House of Lords on Thursday evening. The 15-minute film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from Islam's holy book, the Quran, to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. The British ambassador to the Netherlands told him Wednesday that he would be refused entry into Britain because the beliefs expressed in the film would threaten public security. Do you agree with the UK's decision to bar Wilders? Have your say . Britain's Home Office said barring Wilders is allowed under European Union law, which permits states to refuse entry on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health. ""The government opposes extremism in all its forms,"" said a Home Office spokesman, who would not be identified, in line with policy. ""It will stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country."" Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament for the right-wing Party for Freedom. He released ""Fitna"" online in March 2008 to immediate controversy. The 15-minute film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from Islam's holy book, the Quran, to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. Caroline Cox, a member of Britain's House of Lords who is not affiliated with a political party, invited Wilders to screen his film at a private session in parliament. She told CNN that she wanted lawmakers to see the film to provoke discussion. ""We're showing it on the basis of freedom of speech,"" said Cox, who has been a free speech advocate throughout her career. ""It's a serious showing, with serious concerns and serious consideration."" Cox said she disagreed with the government's decision to bar Wilders, who was also scheduled to discuss the film. ""I think it's appalling,"" she told CNN. ""(For) the British government to prevent a European parliamentarian coming to speak to parliamentarians over here is very disturbing. I think it will be ready by many people as a sign of appeasement to threat and intimidation."" After its release, the movie drew complaints from the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as concern from the United States, which warned it could spark riots. Dutch authorities filed charges against Wilders last month, accusing him of inciting racial hatred in speeches and in the film. ""Fitna"" opens with a controversial caricature of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a turban shaped like a bomb, followed by translated portions of the Quran. The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York. The video includes images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body covering; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians. In his interview with the BBC, Wilders said he does not hate Muslims but opposes the ""Islamization"" of the European continent. The title ""Fitna,"" is Arabic for ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. Five years ago, Dutch director Theo van Gogh was stabbed to death by a member of a radical Islamic group after his short film ""Submission"" used verses from the Quran written on women's bodies to criticize the treatment of women in Islamic cultures. His co-producer on the project, Somali-born former Dutch lawmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, lived under government protection for several years after van Gogh's killing.

042d2d85c1a634e922c847a45409bfaed08d1924,CNN,"(CNN) -- All 12 of the victims killed in Monday's shooting rampage at Washington's Navy Yard were contractors or civilians, authorities said Monday night. Officials identified seven of those killed. They are: . Michael Arnold, 59; . Sylvia Frasier, 53; . Kathy Gaarde, 62; . John Roger Johnson, 73; . Frank Kohler, 50; . Vishnu Pandit, 61; and . Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; . None of those killed were military personnel, authorities said. Wounded survivors of Monday's shooting are eligible for treatment at a U.S. military' hospital, just as if they were soldiers wounded in war. U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, is open to them as he visited two civilian Navy workers being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center Monday afternoon. Twelve victims -- and the suspected shooter -- died as a result of Monday morning's rampage at the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, officials said. It could take another day until everyone is accounted for, the Navy secretary said Monday. A maintenance worker who tried to warn others was among those shot, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus. Jirus told CNN he was standing in an alley at the bottom of a fire escape supervising the evacuation of Building 197 when a worker from a nearby maintenance building approached him. ""He walked up and told me that he heard that there was a shooter in our building,"" Jirus said. ""And we were just standing there maybe three feet away having a conversation, and then we heard two more gunshots, and he went down and that's when I ran."" Jirus said he did not know the man. He was ""fairly certain he is dead, because he was shot in the head."" ""I don't feel lucky that he got hit instead of me, but I feel lucky to be here,"" Jirus said. At least one person, and possibly a second, opened fire, District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray said. Police said one suspected shooter was killed. Three other shooting victims who were flown to MedStar Washington Hospital Center are expected to survive, hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Janis Orlowski told reporters about three hours after the attack began around 8:20 a.m. Monday. Dr. Orlowski gave more details later in the day about her patients, including a Washington Metropolitan police officer who was in surgery Monday afternoon ""for gunshot wounds that ""involve bones and blood vessels of lower legs."" ""He was most concerned about being able to talk to his mother and wanted to make sure he was able to speak to her before he went into surgery,"" Orlowski said. Doctors could know after another day about the police officer's chances of walking again, she said. Witness: 'He aimed his gun at us' and fired . The two other victims at MedStar Washington Hospital Center were women, including one shot in the shoulder and the other with a head wound, Orlowski said. A helicopter plucked one of the wounded women from a roof and carried her to the hospital, she said. ""Their chances of survival are very good,"" she said. The patients were all in stable condition, she said. The woman with the shoulder wound was ""in very, very good spirits,"" Orlowski said. ""She's actually ordering the doctors and nurses around, and we told her we are in charge here."" The other woman suffered a ""significant wound"" to her hand and head, but the bullet didn't actually penetrate her skull, she said. Her father rushed to the Navy Yard when he heard about the shooting, Orlowski said. He found her as paramedics were treating her on the scene, she said. The three patients were each alert when they arrived at the hospital and they sometimes talked about the shooting, Orlowski said. The most common question was about the fate of their co-workers. ""They're very worried about their colleagues,"" she said. ""It's the only question that I've heard about the incident. We've not shared that with them."" Mabus went to the hospital to check on the two women, who are Navy employees. ""We got to meet one of the victims, a young woman and her family,"" Maybus said. ""She is, under the circumstances, doing very well. I also got to talk to the husband of the second victim, who is in surgery right now. But none of the injuries are expected to be life-threatening."" Relatives of people who worked in Building 197 gathered near the Navy yard, hoping for information about their loved ones. Jacqueline Alston said she has not heard from her husband, Ernest, who is a custodial worker there. ""Right now, I'm asking God to let me hear that voice, to let me see that man again,"" Alston said. ""All I know is, I'm supposed to be patient, which I am trying to hold on, being patient and understanding, and ask God what created this problem? What started this?"" Mabus said Monday that it could take 24 to 35 hours for Navy officials to account for everyone. He gave two telephone numbers people can call to check on family members who may have been at the Navy Yard. The numbers are: 202-433-6151 and 202-433-9713 .

98ab729eb453311bdb1687875141d7e4103f6cfb,CNN,"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama had stern words for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over Russia's actions in Ukraine, following a meeting Thursday of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, at which Russia was excluded. Putin ""has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,"" Obama said. But for this to happen, he said, Putin must take steps over the coming weeks that include recognizing Ukraine's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. ""We cannot simply allow drift,"" Obama said, speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron following bilateral talks. ""The mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back from the border and that Russia is now destabilizing Ukraine through surrogates, rather than overtly and explicitly, does not mean that we can afford three months, or four months, or six months, of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine."" If Russia does not de-escalate the situation, the G7 leaders are united and ready to impose further painful economic sanctions, Obama said, with consequences for the Russian people. ""Today, in contrast to a growing global economy, a sluggish Russian economy is even weaker because of the choices made by Russia's leadership,"" he said. Putin was excluded from what was originally planned as a G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. It's the first time in some 20 years that Russia has not been part of the meeting of world economic powers, Obama said, adding that the step is warranted because Moscow's actions have violated international law and gone against the group's principles. Energy security . Putin may not have been at the table, but the summit's message was clearly directed at Russia. In a joint statement issued late Wednesday, the G7 leaders pledged their support for the Ukrainian people and government ""in the face of unacceptable interference in Ukraine's sovereign affairs by the Russian Federation."" They also warned Moscow that they are ready to intensify targeted economic sanctions and impose new costs on Russia ""should events so require."" ""Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilize eastern Ukraine are unacceptable and must stop,"" the statement said. ""We urge the Russian Federation to recognize the results of the election, complete the withdrawal of its military forces on the border with Ukraine, stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence."" The G7 leaders also talked about energy security, amid concern over Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas and Moscow's capacity to hold nations hostage to political maneuvering. Obama will next head to Paris, where he will dine with French President Francois Hollande. Putin also will be hosted by the French President on Thursday -- but at a separate dinner. Obama and Putin are among a number of leaders invited to take part in ceremonies in France to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which helped change the course of World War II. They are likely to cross paths while both are in France, Obama said, but no formal talks have been announced. If they should speak, Obama added, he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. There may be one touchy subject at Obama's dinner with Hollande. In his remarks after the G7 meeting, Obama said he had ""expressed concerns about continuing significant defense deals with Russia at a time when they've violated basic international law,"" a reference to a $1.6 billion French deal to sell warships to Moscow. ""President Hollande understands my position,"" Obama said, adding that he in turn recognizes that this is a big deal for France and that it's important for jobs. Nonetheless, Obama said, ""I think it would've been preferable to press the pause button. President Hollande so far has not done so."" Putin: I won't avoid anyone . Although Putin was not invited to the G7 meeting -- which brings together the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan -- he will have talks on Ukraine with some G7 leaders while they are all in France. Besides Hollande, they include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Cameron. The D-Day events, which include a spectacular fireworks show Thursday evening along the Normandy coastline and continue into the weekend, may also bring Putin and Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko face to face. Asked in an interview with French television station TF1 if he would speak with Ukraine's new leader, Putin said he will not ""evade"" Poroshenko or anyone else. ""There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,"" he said, according to the Kremlin's translation. Poroshenko also did not exclude the possibility, speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Warsaw. ""As things stand now, a meeting between me and Putin is not envisaged, but I do not rule out that it could take place in one format or another. So let's talk about it when there are grounds for it,"" he said. Hollande said that both were invited, although Poroshenko is due to arrive only on Saturday. Putin: No Russian intervention in Ukraine . Questioned in the same TF1 interview about Russia's intentions in Ukraine, Putin denied it had sought to annex or destabilize its neighbor. ""We never did that,"" he said. ""The Ukrainian government must now sit down and talk with their own people instead of using weapons, tanks, planes and helicopters. They must start the negotiating process."" Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia. Asked if it was true that Russia had intervened directly, Putin was again vehement in his denial. ""There are no armed forces, no Russian 'instructors' in southeastern Ukraine. And there never were any,"" he said. Putin reiterated his position that Russia respects the Ukrainian people's vote and that Moscow will work with the authorities in Kiev. He also said Russia recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty, while acknowledging that any move by Kiev to join NATO ""worries us."" This concern was a factor in Russia's annexation of Crimea, Putin told the French broadcaster, following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in what Moscow regards as an illegal coup. Whether Putin and Poroshenko meet personally, Russia will give the new Ukrainian president some official recognition when its ambassador to Ukraine attends Poroshenko's inauguration Saturday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday, according to state-run RIA Novosti, that Ambassador Mikhail Zurabov will also resume his duties in Kiev. ""He is returning to Kiev in order to continue executing his functions,"" Lukashevich said. Obama vows to stand with Ukraine as he meets President-elect in Poland .

f63cfe3b46ac071425bbc8aea040661a75c55924,CNN,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A restaurateur has gone to great lengths to tackle the spread of the H1N1 virus in his eatery, including taking staff's temperatures before they start work and preventing them from touching plates directly. Kitchen staff at Silk and Soya restaurant in Spain wear face masks and gloves while preparing food. Silk and Soya, a Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid, Spain, implemented the measures to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, in the upscale locale. ""We implemented these measures so that our employees would serve only food, not a virus,"" restaurant owner Cipri Quintas told CNN.   As well as employees having their temperatures taken before starting their shifts, windows are opened to aerate the restaurant before meals. Each table is set at least one meter -- 3.2 feet -- from any other table.   Any member of the kitchen staff involved in food preparation must wear a mask and gloves, and waiters are required to hold napkins when carrying plates to avoid touching them directly with their hands. Upon entering the elevators leading to the top-floor restaurant, customers find an automatic disinfectant gel dispenser.  At each table, diners find a packet of gel next to their silverware. The restaurant's restroom doors are propped open, the lights turn on automatically and the faucets are hands-free -- measures intended to keep customers from having to touch surfaces after they've washed their hands.   Similar initiatives are under way around the world. Last spring, during the peak of the scare in Mexico City, restaurants were closed for 12 days. When the restaurants reopened, the government ordered owners to put extra space between the tables and not to allow more than half of seats to be filled at any given time; cooks and waiters were mandated to wear surgical masks.   The World Health Organization's Web site states that hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent infection and provides instructions with drawings that can be printed and posted in public places, such as restaurants. Silk and Soya's Quintas started his anti-H1N1 measures in August and has already proved popular with some customers. Simona Savin, who was having lunch, told CNN, ""These are measures you don't see everywhere. Here you have everything. They are great because there's a need for hygiene.""   Another diner, swimming coach Fernando Barea, said, ""We came to the restaurant because we heard good things about it and I wanted to see these measures against the H1N1 flu. These measures should be used by other restaurants.""   Quintas predicted they soon will be. ""People from other businesses like hotels and theaters have called us asking, 'What have you done? Can we come see your setup?' There's been a big response,"" said Quintas.   He insisted that his goal is not solely to garner publicity, but to protect his customers and staff -- a responsibility, he said, that the business community at large should undertake.   One expert on the disease applauded the efforts and recommended they be broadened.  ""They should implement them every winter against all respiratory diseases,"" said Dr. Tom Jefferson, a medical epidemiologist with the Cochrane Collaboration. The international organization reviews health care interventions and ""promotes the search for evidence in the form of clinical trials and other studies of interventions,"" according to its Web site.   As of September 13, the WHO had tallied more than 296,000 cases worldwide, 3,486 of them fatal.",8,9.534180857022381

Hundreds of uniformed police blocked media from joining the protesters as they approached the gates of the embassy. Relatives despair as weather delays Flight 370 search . Many protesters wore white t-shirts that read, ""Please pray for the passengers of MH370. We pray for their safe return."" Some carried signs with messages of frustration and grief. ""Malaysian government, tell the truth. We've been waiting too long,"" read one. ""Husband, please come home,"" said another. Overcome by stress and raw emotion, one woman was carried out from the cordoned area on a stretcher by paramedics. Petition letter . Earlier, the protesters had walked on foot from the Lido Hotel, near Beijing's International Airport, after police prevented them from boarding buses to the embassy. Many relatives have been staying at the hotel since the airliner vanished more than two weeks ago. The protesters left the embassy on buses on Tuesday afternoon after a Malaysian official accepted a petition letter from the families. The previous evening, Malaysia's prime minister announced that Flight MH370's last position was in a remote part of the Indian Ocean. Soon after, Malaysian Airlines informed relatives that the lives of all on board the plane had been lost. Relatives at the Lido Hotel screamed and sobbed after hearing the news. The airline has already given family members $5,000 in compensation for each passenger aboard the ill-fated flight, and is preparing to make additional payments as the search continues. ""No amount of compensation or consolation will make up for any loss of life,"" Malaysia Airlines Chairman Mohamad Nor Yusof said Tuesday. The company is working on an arrangement to fly families to Australia once wreckage is found. Visa fees will be waived for the families of MH370 passengers and crew flying in to Australia, the country's defense minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Texts criticism . Malaysia Airlines has defended its decision to inform the families by text message -- along with phone calls and face-to-face meetings -- that the flight ended in the Indian Ocean. The airline's CEO, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said Tuesday that text messages were used to ensure the nearly 1,000 family members ""heard the tragic news before the world did."" China has asked Malaysia to share any evidence that led it to conclude the airliner crashed in the Indian Ocean with no survivors.

43d2e27724e73ba8f0cc10e13bdbf1c2c4d4890c,CNN,"(CNN) -- Survivors of a mass shooting attack in Norway returned Saturday for the first time to the island where a gunman went on a rampage a month ago, killing 69 people. More than 1,000 people are expected to visit Utoya island Saturday, state broadcaster NRK said. Television footage showed young people picking their way along the shoreline and spreading across the small island. Many of those who survived did so by hiding among rocks and vegetation or swimming out into the chilly waters around the island. The survivors' visit comes a day after relatives of those killed were allowed to travel to the island for the first time to see where their loved ones' final moments were spent. Police officers were at hand to point out to the families exactly where those killed were found. Many lit candles and left flowers in makeshift shrines, local media reported. Several hundred people were attending a political summer camp held by the youth wing of the governing Labour Party at the time of the July 22 shooting attack. Many of those killed were teenagers. NRK said Saturday's visit was the first time many of the young people had seen one another since the traumatic events a month ago. The island remains a crime scene, as police investigate the mass shooting and the bombing of Oslo government buildings on the same day, which claimed the lives of eight more people . The suspect in both attacks, Anders Breivik, was ordered held in isolation for four more weeks Friday after appearing before a judge in Oslo. Giving his ruling, the judge said Breivik should continue to be held in solitary confinement because there was a real danger otherwise that he would tamper with evidence and hinder the police investigation. Breivik, 32, had told the court that being held in isolation is ""boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture,"" the judge said. Breivik admitted the attacks, a judge and his lawyer say, but has pleaded not guilty in court. Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby, of Oslo Police District, told reporters Friday that 400 witnesses had now been questioned in connection with the two attacks. Breivik will face further interrogation this week, he said. CNN's Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.",1,5.706163888104611
0a83c82ca6874b60f1c4d4d89bce849ee61074b4,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship. The loss didn't go over well with hundreds of mostly young Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from Rogers Arena where the game was played. Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown. iReport: Fires, rioting and looting in Vancouver . Aerial footage showed Vancouver police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd leaped over one street fire, and officers wrestled several fans to the ground. ""We're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief, vandalism, and fights,"" Vancouver Police Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement. ""We're working hard to get everyone home safe."" Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire. After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period. The Bruins blew open the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand sprung on a rebound off of Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the match. ""We knew the second goal was going to be huge,"" Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. ""It was nice to get that one, and we kept pushing forward after that."" Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist. But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a Game Seven shutout to take the coveted Conn Smythe trophy. Tim Thomas -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the Canucks all night -- set the NHL record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history. He also shattered Johnny Bower's 1960s record for most saves in a Stanley Cup final. Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays. But that wasn't the case in this year's Stanley Cup, as Boston put away five power play goals to Vancouver's two. Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period. ""We finally brought our game from home on the road,"" Zdeno Chara told Team Radio Canada. ""We played physical and took care of the puck, played extremely hard and paid attention to the details."" Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series. The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but hadn't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been to the finals five other times since they last won, but this time marked their first appearance since 1990. The Canucks have been to the finals three times in their 40 seasons in the league, but have never won. Holding the home-ice advantage, they won the first two games of the series, but lost all three games played in Boston before losing at home on Wednesday. They were seeking to become the first Canadian team to win the NHL title since the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.",1,9.567374018996027

Moslehi made the announcement Sunday at an event marking the first anniversary of the death of 35-year-old physicist Daryoush Rezaie. In addition to the suspected ""terrorists"" who shot and killed Rezaie outside his Tehran home on July 23, 2011, ""two groups in charge of training terrorists were arrested inside and outside Iran,"" Moslehi said, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.

Professor Majid Shahriari was killed, but professor Fereydoun Abbasi and his wife escaped with only minor wounds. Shahriari's wife and driver were injured. Both professors were on the faculty of Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University. Assailants on motorcycles attached bombs to cars carrying the professors at separate locations. In January 2010, Iranian elementary-particle physicist Massoud Ali-Mohammadi was also killed in a bomb attack, according to Mehr. Ali-Mohammadi, 50, was riding his motorcycle near his Tehran home when a remote-controlled bomb planted on the bike detonated, according to Iranian media. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted in that killing and also found guilty of spying. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, and said Israel paid him $120,000 to carry out the hit. He was hanged in May. Iran has blamed spy agencies in Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom for the attacks. Israeli President Shimon Peres told CNN on Monday that Israel has never claimed responsibility for the attacks, but he said his country has a right to prevent the killing of its citizens.

44bcca7f794c9d786415eda744f5e2fcf4fadc73,CNN,"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Liverpool were beaten by two penalties in Lisbon as Benfica came from behind to grasp the advantage in their Europa League quarterfinal. The Portuguese club suffered a nightmare start when Daniel Agger put the visitors in front after just nine minutes with a neat back heel from Steven Gerrard's free kick. But just after the half hour mark Liverpool were reduced to ten men when Ryan Babel clashed with defender Luisao after he had fouled Spanish striker Fernando Torres. Babel appeared to put his hands in Luisao's face and the referee produced a red card. It took Benfica less than 30 minutes to press home their advantage when Liverpool defender Emiliano Insua brought down Pablo Aimar inside the box and conceded a penalty. Oscar Cardozo converted the spot kick and was given the chance to put his side into the lead when the referee adjudged Jamie Carragher had handled in the area on 79 minutes. Again Cardozo made no mistake from the spot. The return leg is at Anfield next Thursday. Fulham vanquished seasoned European opponents again as they defeated German champions Wolfsburg 2-1 at Craven Cottage. Striker Bobby Zamora gave the English side the lead on 59 minutes with a precise curling shot from the edge of the area. Irish winger Damien Duff made it 2-0 just four minutes later as he converted Zamora's pass. But in the final minute Wolfsburg scored a vital away goal as Alexander Madlung emphatically headed home Zvjezdan Misimovic's cross. After the game Fulham manager Roy Hodgson told ESPN television: ""Wolfsburg are a good team but tonight I thought we made them look reasonably ordinary."" The all-Spanish tie between Valencia and Atletico Madrid finished 2-2. Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan put Atletico in front on 59 minutes but Manuel Fernandes equalized shortly after for the home side. Atletico struck again through Antonio Lopez only for Spain forward David Villa to rescue a draw for Valencia. In the evening's other match Hamburg beat Belgian side Standard Liege 2-1 in Germany. A strike from Deiudonne Mbokani gave Liege an early advantage but goals from Mladen Petric and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy secured Hamburg a lead to take into the second leg.",7,7.522756540451938
d6ba5f1f785f79f4974cc1b592891d0f1d0b7c83,CNN,"(CNN) -- Todd Zeile still can remember the smell. It was an awful, metallic stench, the odor of burning steel, that filled the Mets team bus as it pulled across the George Washington Bridge on September 12, 2001. The players, returning from a trip to Pittsburgh in the only way they could after a nationwide air traffic shutdown, crowded to the right side of the bus. They saw that black cloud over lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center had stood, and in an instant understood the pain and fear that had gripped their city. ""I remember wondering, 'What do we do with the group?'"" said Bobby Valentine, their manager at the time. ""If we were going to just be a Band-Aid over this gaping wound or were we going to actually make a difference?"" The answer, in so many ways, was the latter. The immediate reaction after the 9/11 attacks was to dismiss sports as unimportant, to postpone the games as the nation came to grips with what happened. Everyone agreed that was the right decision. But soon after, the games people love became an integral part of the healing process for the New York region. The athletes, some with absolutely no ties to the city but a uniform, became a source of inspiration. They went to ground zero to meet with the men and women working night and day to clean up. They lifted boxes of relief supplies off trucks, many times in stadium parking lots that had become staging areas. They wore caps and uniform patches to honor the firefighters and police officers who lost their lives trying to save others as the World Trade Center fell. Former Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde remembers going to ground zero a few days after the towers fell, passing the soldiers with machine guns at their sides to shake hands with the rescue workers. ""It was a little frightening to be down there, walking around, not knowing what was going to happen,"" Testaverde said this week, ""and not knowing what you were going to see."" Then, at a time when many wondered if it was right -- or even safe -- to gather and cheer for something as trivial as a baseball game, they helped everyone realize it was OK to be normal again. ""It almost felt defiant,"" said Zeile, then an infielder for the Mets. ""It was like New York saying to the world, 'We're going to be OK. You can hit us, but you can't keep us down.'"" It is only fitting, then, that the biggest ceremonies commemorating the 9/11 attacks will take place in NFL stadiums. It will begin in Landover, Maryland, where fans of the two cities most affected by the attacks -- New York and Washington -- will gather to watch the Giants play the Redskins. It will continue Sunday night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where 80,000 fans will receive a small American flag upon entering the stadium for the Jets-Cowboys game. Bagpipers from New York police and fire departments will perform ""Amazing Grace"" and Lady Antebellum will sing the national anthem. Then, the focus will shift to the games, which is what happened in a cathartic way after 9/11. ""I felt like, if anything, we gave people a break from what was going on,"" said Kerry Collins, the Giants quarterback at the time. Collins would give $275,000 to 9/11 charities in the weeks that followed and develop a bond with a firehouse in Greenwich Village. ""It was, 'Hey, we can watch the Giants. The Giants are on,'"" he said. ""I felt pressure to win in Kansas City that next weekend, but more important was playing in a way that would make people proud. That we won the game was an added bonus. It was nice to know that, on some level, we had a positive influence on the events that were going on. Nowhere was the influence greater than with the Mets, who played the first major sporting event in the city after the attacks on September 21, 2001. John Franco, a relief pitcher with the team and a New York native, remembers how different things felt when he arrived at Shea Stadium that day. The debate about whether  the games should resume had raged in the city for four days. ""Just coming to the ballpark that day, you weren't sure if it was the right thing to do,"" Franco said. ""Soon as you pulled into the players' lot you had the bomb squad out there with the dogs and the mirrors looking under the car."" The Atlanta Braves were in town, and for one night, the bitter NL East rivals became willing participants in something bigger than a pennant race. Marc Anthony sang the national anthem. Then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a lifelong Yankees fan, was honored before the game and received a standing ovation. Chipper Jones, the Braves star, admitted he was ""scared to death."" If the terrorists wanted to strike again, was there a better target than a major-league ballpark filled with people? The early innings were a blur, Zeile said, a somber night until the seventh inning stretch. Liza Minnelli performed ""New York, New York,"" and while there was some uncertainty in the crowd about how to respond to such a celebratory song, that changed when firefighters and cops joined her in a high-stepping dance like burly Rockettes. The Braves took the lead in the top of the eighth. Mike Piazza, the Mets star catcher, came to the plate in the bottom of the inning, and on an 0-1 count, hit a towering home run to center field to give the Mets a 3-2 lead they never relinquished. The crowd responded with cheers, some tears, and then this: . ""USA! USA! USA!"" Watch Piazza's dramatic home run . When Shea Stadium closed seven years later, it had seen 5,791 home runs. None was bigger. ""It was almost like a blur to me, it was almost like a dream, sort of surreal,"" Piazza said at the time. ""I'm just so happy I gave the people something to cheer. There was a lot of emotion. It was just a surreal sort of energy out there. I'm just so proud to be a part of it tonight."" Later that fall the New York Yankees would make provide more dramatic relief to the city in their run to the World Series, where they lost game 7 in the ninth inning to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Piazza will be part of the remembrance events at before the Mets-Cubs game at the Mets new stadium, Citi Field on Sunday night, catching a ceremonial first pitch from John Franco before the Mets take the field. Everyone in the stadium will pause to remember. Then, just as they did 10 years ago, they'll play ball.",7,9.020036722403757
2e7647f5cfed98f97e4a6989fcecd9da4319532f,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""It could have been the secret to my success or the secret to my demise,"" a wistful Serena Williams says of her 2013 season. The irresistible force in women's tennis is talking about her record-breaking year, one in which she vowed to play more than she ever had done previously. It was a decision that paid huge dividends. Not only did her victories at the French Open and U.S. Open take her grand slam tally to 17, she also successfully defended her season-ending WTA Championships crown. She claimed 11 titles in 2013 -- the best return in the women's game for 16 years -- adding $12.3 million in prize money to what has become a very healthy bank balance over the years. Far from slowing down, Williams has a new spring in her step at the age of 32. Her 17 major titles mean she is just one behind Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova and within sight of Steffi Graf, out in front on 22 grand slam titles in the post-1968 Open era. ""It is getting exciting,"" Williams told CNN. ""I have four grand slams next year to try and at least catch up with Martina and Chrissy so it will be really exciting. ""Hopefully I can do it but really being here 17 is fun, obviously I want more and I never want to stop until I reach my goals. ""I'm excited about just looking forward to the possibilities of next year. ""I started with 15 and this year I'm starting with 17 (next year) so hopefully I can win a couple -- one, two or three, who knows? Any would be good for me."" Serena's career has been transformed since she teamed up with coach Patrick Moratoglou after a demoralizing first round defeat at the 2012 French Open. Having tumbled to 175 in the world after a series of injury-hit seasons, he helped Serena roar back to the top of the game; if and when Serena breaks 18, his pride will be immeasurable too. ""Martina and Chris, they are legends, so to have Serena part of this small group means a lot,"" Frenchman Moratoglou said. ""It means a lot to her too that she's only one grand slam away to reach them and then maybe to overtake them it's an option that you can really think about it. ""There will be a lot of emotion when she'll be close to winning the next grand slam and sitting next to those great champions, but she can make it. ""Steffi is a bit far away still. I think it's too early to speak about Steffi -- she has 22 -- so (Serena) has to win five more and six more to overtake Steffi so that's a long way. ""I think it's important not to look at the mountain when you want to climb it, just the next step."" Moratoglou is from the school of thought that a defeat, however painful, can provide an important reality check and provoke an elite athlete into a drive to ensure it isn't repeated. That pivotal reverse to Virginie Razzano at the French Open last year spurred Williams on to a spike in form and another shock grand slam exit -- to Sabine Lisicki at Wimbledon this year -- acted as a similar catalyst. ""It was definitely motivating -- I definitely learnt a lot from that match,"" Williams explains of her defeat to the German in round four. ""It wasn't good that I lost but it was good that I was able to learn from that loss and I was able to do better and I won some matches because of that loss so I guess it helped me out."" And though Serena is quick to pay tribute to her team from agent to coach, hitting partner to physio, she also revealed that she still leans on the support of her mum, who was with her during her triumphant WTA Championships campaign, and dad to help her game. She said: ""I called my dad every match at the U.S. Open from the third round on, he really helped me in that tournament, and he really helped me behind the scenes to win some matches. ""I was really happy to have the support and have his help and so yeah I definitely rely on my dad and my dad for a lot of coaching.""",7,9.920058479832193
29b4fe0bcc817c4f736218dc4ddc4a720e322607,CNN,"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- ""It was killing people, and I wanted to do something about it."" Bambi Gaddist's nonprofit has provided free HIV tests to more than 8,600 people since 2000. That realization about the AIDS crisis propelled Bambi Gaddist into activism in South Carolina more than 20 years ago, and she's been relentless in her fight to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS there ever since. One of the most effective tools in her arsenal? A large white RV. With ""GET TESTED"" written in bold letters on its side, the camper van is the mobile unit of the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council, a nonprofit that Gaddist helped start and has headed since 1995. The only unit of its kind in South Carolina, the van brings confidential HIV testing and information to communities across the state. Since 2000, Gaddist's organization has provided HIV tests to more than 8,600 people, free of charge. Gaddist says the face of AIDS has changed since the mid-1980s, when she helped run one of the first grass-roots AIDS awareness campaigns in Columbia, South Carolina, while pursuing her doctorate in public health. ""In the '80s, HIV was seen as a gay, white male disease,"" Gaddist said. ""Here in South Carolina, it became an African-American disease."" In 2006, African-Americans accounted for 76 percent of the new AIDS cases diagnosed in South Carolina, and the state ranked ninth in the nation for those living with the disease, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. iReport.com: Share stories of being black in America . Statistics like these are what drives Gaddist and her staff. The mobile unit hits the road at least two to three times a week, and Gaddist says it goes just about anywhere -- gay and straight nightclubs, housing projects, health fairs or churches. ""We refuse to be quiet. That's what's going to save the lives of our children: talking about it and not hiding it,"" Gaddist said. At outreach events, staffers distribute free condoms and information while trying to recruit people to be tested. Eight to 15 people usually take the 10-minute test at every event. Someday, Gaddist hopes, HIV tests will be as common as breast cancer exams or skin cancer screenings.  Watch Gaddist and her team in action outside a nightclub » . ""We're trying to normalize this,"" Gaddist said. ""[We want] anyone, regardless of who they are, to say, 'I need to know my status.'

5c96f72dfcb40da29607d7cb42370b54b6aba94c,CNN,"(CNN) -- Princeton University will make a meningitis B vaccine available to all undergraduate students, graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions, the school said Tuesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have officially recommended that these groups of people receive the vaccine, Princeton said. The CDC's Institutional Review Board approved this measure Tuesday afternoon, spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said. The vaccine, which is not licensed for use in the United States, will not be provided to anyone else or given out anywhere else, the school said. Young adults and individuals with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of meningitis, especially when living in close proximity to one another, such as in dormitories, the school said. The vaccine is called Bexsero and is made by Novartis. It has been approved in Europe and Australia. The first dose of the vaccine will be available at the school's Frist Campus Center from December 9 to December 12, and the second dose will be available in February. For maximum protection, individuals must receive two doses. Princeton will cover the cost of the vaccine. The vaccine would be recommended for about 5,000 undergraduates and 550 graduate students in dorms, university spokesman Martin Mbugua had told CNN previously. Additionally, around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected, although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions, he said. These include conditions where the spleen is compromised, or certain other immune system disorders. The school announced Friday that an eighth case of meningitis B had been reported, the latest in a string of cases reported this year. All eight were caused by a rare meningococcal bacteria known as serotype B. Also last week, the University of California, Santa Barbara, reported that three students were being treated for meningococcal disease and that their cases were caused by type B bacteria -- the same bacteria strain causing the Princeton outbreak. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department said. New Jersey state law requires all students at Princeton living in dormitories to receive a different meningitis vaccine, which is licensed in the United States. That vaccine protects against some other strains, but not serotype B bacteria. Any Princeton student who received the usual meningitis vaccine would not not be protected, Princeton said. What is meningitis B? Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. Meningitis usually develops in response to bacteria or viruses, but there can be other forms and causes, such as physical injury, cancer or certain drugs, according to the CDC. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the New Jersey state health department. Symptoms can include a stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B. School activities continue . Several students told CNN that their peers are not overly afraid of getting meningitis, but that it's definitely a topic of conversation. ""I think students do know that it is an important and fatal issue that is spreading on campus -- and each student individually decides to what degree to protect themselves,"" Stephen Cognetta, a junior, said in an e-mail. In Princeton's statement Tuesday, the university said: ""The CDC and state health officials recommend that classes and activities at Princeton University continue as planned, and the surrounding community can continue to attend events on the campus. They do not recommend any travel restrictions for members of the University community."" The university celebrated its football team's victories over Harvard and Yale on Sunday with a bonfire.

ad29c1c7d5b3febf646e2c9c11175323b9440187,CNN,"(CNN) -- First-term Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk said ""no frickin' way am I retiring"" in an interview with Roll Call published Friday morning, instead clearly signaling his intentions to run for reelection in 2016. His statement comes amid speculation that his health and staff turnover might cause him to step down after his first term. His chief of staff Erik Elk has said he will join the private sector, while other top staffers have joined newly elected GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner's team. And a debilitating stroke in 2012 has caused the senator to occasionally rely on a wheelchair. ""With all this rehab, for me just to walk was a huge effort,"" Kirk told Roll Call. ""I had to re-learn how to walk again after the stroke. And all the rehab and all the effort shows the mental determination times 10 to keep serving."" But Kirk also said that attacks from the left highlighting his previous health problems might actually help his campaign efforts. ""That would not be taken well by the people of Illinois who would not like that kind of attack,"" he said. ""It's the only way that Democrats can win in Illinois, is to say, 'Oh, Kirk has health problems, he's going to retire.'"" Illinois, typically a deep blue state, will likely be a top target for Democrats in 2016 looking to regain Senate seats after suffering big losses across the country earlier this month.

a11519e9b85f2f4584a5854d396ec27717347178,CNN,"(CNN) -- The first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history -- it was the first time that all Americans could buy health insurance regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. But despite the good news, criticism of the ACA continues. Some Republicans have eagerly identified individuals who are not happy with the ACA. Sanjay Gupta: Better health not about Obamacare, it's about you . As 2014—a midterm election year—dawns, it is time to ask: What does the GOP offer other than negativism? What is the GOP alternative to the ACA, who would it help and who would it hurt? Until now, the Republican war cry has been repeal, for which they have voted repeatedly. But ACA repeal is neither realistic, responsible, nor perhaps, even possible. The 10 titles of the ACA contain hundreds of provisions that reform Medicare payment, combat fraud and abuse, and improve health care quality. Many are already in place. Total repeal of the ACA would rip many threads already woven into the fabric of our health care system. Opinion: When will we get the verdict on Obamacare? A targeted repeal of the less popular provisions of the ACA, the individual and employer mandates and some ACA taxes and fees, might be more feasible. But revoking the mandates would disrupt insurance markets and repealing the taxes will increase the deficit. Does the GOP have anything constructive to offer? The answer, sadly, is not really. House Republicans have put forward two proposals -- the American Health Care Reform Act, sponsored by a majority of House Republicans, and Rep. Tom Price's Empowering Patients First Act. Both are lengthy bills that largely recycle longstanding Republican panaceas. The American Health Care Reform Act would replace the ACA's income-based tax credits with flat dollar tax deductions. Tax deductions are valuable to high-income Americans with high tax rates, but offer little or nothing to the low-income Americans helped by the ACA. The Empowering Patients First Act offers flat dollar tax credits that do not vary by age, geography, or health status—all of which could influence health insurance premiums. These tax credits might almost fully cover the health insurance premium of a young healthy male, but would be essentially useless to an older, low-income family, which would be left thousands of dollars short of the cost of basic coverage. The American Health Care Reform Act touts health savings accounts as the solution to every problem, but tax-subsidized health savings accounts are also primarily of value to higher-income Americans and useless to Americans whose income is too low to be taxed and who lack discretionary income to invest in health savings accounts. As the media spotlight high cost sharing under ACA plans in the coming months, it should ask how much higher cost sharing would be under the GOP plans. Conservatives, such as John Goodman, champion very high deductible policies, and Republican proposals, unlike the ACA, do not limit cost sharing. By repealing the ACA, Republicans would reinstate pre-existing condition exclusions for many of the uninsured. The primary relief they offer to the uninsured with health problems are state high-risk pools. High-risk pools, however, are very expensive, and without massive federal support would be unaffordable to many Americans. Exclusion of Americans from insurance coverage would also likely increase under Republican proposals to permit interstate health insurance sales, which could drive a race to the bottom in state insurance regulation. Association health plans have a history of undermining state reforms aimed at covering individuals and groups with pre-existing conditions. Opinion: Why I signed up for Obamacare . One cannot imagine a GOP health care proposal that did not promise to place more barriers in the way of Americans injured by medical negligence who seek compensation. Although our medical litigation system could certainly use reform, proposals for change would reduce health care costs by only a small amount: half a percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including defensive medicine. Republican malpractice ""reform"" proposals may be politically popular, but do not address our health care system's real problems. The GOP does not promise that if you like your insurance plan you can keep it, and with good reason. The vast majority of privately insured Americans are covered through their work. The American Health Care Reform Act would abolish current deductions and exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance. This would not only be one of the largest middle class tax increases in American history, but could result in millions of Americans losing employer-sponsored insurance. Whatever disruptions the ACA may cause in coming months, it moves us toward more comprehensive and affordable coverage for low- and middle-income and sicker Americans. The alternatives proposed by House Republicans would be very disruptive, and unsurprisingly, benefit the healthy and wealthy. Americans must ask themselves: Who offers the most needed reforms for our health care system? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Jost.",8,14.424942390092676
eba6fc8b9eb97988e970e5c620e45f5a8973e93a,CNN,"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Most football fans, if they are not already, will have to become rabid carnivores during their visit to South Africa for the World Cup. South Africans like their meat and they like to cook and eat it out in the open, under the clear blue skies. If you are invited to a ""braai"" or a ""chisa nyama"" you are basically going to a barbeque. There are variations on what you will be offered, depending on who is hosting you and where you are. In general, you will find yourself eating spicy sausages called ""boerewors,"" lamb chops and some ""pap,"" which looks like mashed potato but is maize meal. Pap is often served with delicious tomato gravy. Of course, the food is washed down with copious amounts of South African beer. Another meat staple in South Africa is ""biltong"" -- which is a bit like beef jerky, but tastes much better. Biltong is an excellent snack to nibble on as you journey through the country. Try the kudu or ostrich biltong, or just stick to good old beef. Either way, you can get addicted to the stuff. It is very more-ish. The key to eating well in South Africa, or anywhere in the world, is simple: stick to local, fresh dishes. So I would not suggest that English football fans order grilled sole in Rustenburg, which is nowhere near the sea. However, the French and Danish football fans have it lucky -- their teams are based in Knynsa, on the Garden Route. So local oysters and fresh fish, such as the succulent Kabeljou, should be on their menus. That said, except for Cape Town and the surrounding areas in the winelands which have sophisticated restaurant scene, most South African food is simple and not fancy. So, stick to the basics at restaurants and a huge T-bone or a juicy fillet steak will not disappoint you. The prices might knock your socks off -- choice pieces of meat are much cheaper than in most capital cities. If you are looking for a quick meal on the way to a football match, munch on decent burgers from ""Steers"" or delicious spicy chicken from ""Nandos."" You should be able to find at least one of these eateries in most South African towns. If you prefer a good-sized trendy sandwich packed with rocket leaves and other posh nosh, try the ""Lulu"" chain. You can also get excellent takeaway coffee from the distinctive, red-and-white decorated ""Vida e Caffe."" As far as fast-food joints go, all of these offer great food. South African farms export fresh fruit and vegetables to Europe, so do not worry about getting sick from dirty germs that plague some travelers in developing countries. Often, the food in South Africa is fresher than the stuff you buy in supermarkets in London or elsewhere on the continent. During the winter here in the Southern Hemisphere, you will find loads of avocados on the shelves. Stock up, because I think nothing tastes as delicious as in-season avos from the Limpopo region of the country. Also, ""mielies"" are what the rest of the world call ""corn on the cob."" South African mielies are sweet and crunchy, so look out for them at a braai or when you go food shopping. Don't be a nervous eater when traveling to South Africa, it would be a shame to miss out on the cheap, fresh produce available.",7,7.696781757571185
68307e415235fbaffe29cafeb49926d11be6d63a,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- If the Bush administration had known there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it probably wouldn't have decided to invade in 2003, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in an interview broadcast Sunday. Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, Rumsfeld noted there were multiple reasons for attacking Iraq and ousting Saddam Hussein from power. However, intelligence reports -- now shown to have been false -- that Iraq possessed WMDs were the main reason for going in, Rumsfeld said. ""No question it was the big one,"" he said. Asked if the United States would not have invaded if the administration hadn't believed Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction, Rumsfeld said: ""I think that's probably right."" He criticized the source known as ""Curveball"" -- an Iraqi defector who admitted his claims that Iraq possessed WMDs were false -- but stopped short of condemning the U.S. intelligence community. ""The intelligence community talks to hundreds of people,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They have human assets, such as this man. Some are honest, some are dishonest. Some do it for money, some do it for self aggrandizement. Some do it, apparently, to lie."" Now peddling a book, four years after being replaced by Robert Gates as defense secretary following heavy Republican losses in the 2006 mid-term elections, Rumsfeld maintained the swagger and bravado that were his hallmarks when dealing with the media as a Cabinet member. He said said the Obama administration was ""wrong in attacking the Bush administration's structures that have kept this country safe for almost a decade now,"" including the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama campaigned on the promise that he would close the facility known as Gitmo in his first year in office, but it remains open. ""They now have switched from the campaign mode, and they are keeping Guantanamo Bay. They are keeping indefinite detention,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They are keeping military commissions. So obviously, they've come to the conclusion that their campaign promises -- easier to campaign than it is to govern."" Rumsfeld also rejected the premise that the United States is viewed more favorably around the world with Obama as president. ""No, and I don't think there's data that supports that,"" Rumsfeld said. ""I think he had made a practice of trying to apologize for America. I personally am proud of America."" He was also critical of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama in his first year in office in 2009. ""Well, he had not accomplished a thing when he got the Nobel Prize,"" Rumsfeld said. ""It was given to him on hope. Had to have been, because there wasn't anything that he'd done."" Despite receiving some boos when he recently was honored at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists, Rumsfeld said the Tea Party movement has brought ""a lot of energy into public life and public affairs."" He said he was ""deeply worried about the budget"" and that the country needs to start saving money now. Some of those savings can come in the Pentagon budget he formerly oversaw, he said. ""My goodness, every year the Congress was stuffing $10 billion down the Pentagon's throat that we didn't want,"" Rumsfeld said. ""There's no question that there's money there.""",3,4.740492315024571
19a2be0f99a8c2d29a7733c0ee5ba0ffd41ad4dd,CNN,"(CNN) -- Defending champions Manchester United made it two wins out of two in the new English Premier League season as they beat Tottenham 3-0 at Old Trafford. Second half goals from Danny Welbeck, Anderson and Wayne Rooney sealed a comfortable victory for Alex Ferguson's youthful side, who went joint top of the table. It marked defeat for Tottenham in their opening game of the season after their first fixture of the new campaign was canceled due to the London riots. Victory took United level at the summit with rivals Manchester City, who maintained their 100 per cent record with a 3-2 win at Bolton on Sunday. United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports: ""The second half was absolutely fantastic. I thought it a fast game, end-to-end, it was very even but in the second half we took off and it was a fantastic performance."" On hearing it was the second youngest team Manchester United had fielded in the Premier League era Ferguson added: ""It tells you we still believe in young players, more so when you see the ability they've got. ""This group have fantastic ability -- they force you to play them."" On Welbeck he added: ""He's always shown great loyalty Danny, when we put him on loan at Sunderland last season that's when he grew up. ""He's a bit rangy, a long-legged boy who can gallop quickly, he's a good footballer and has a great attitude to win the ball back."" Tom Cleverley was the first to test Tottenham's goalkeeper Brad Friedel as the veteran American turned his goal-bound effort round the post before Ashley Young went close with a looping header from Rooney's cross. Jermain Defoe and Gareth Bale both tested United's Spanish keeper David De Gea in the second half before Welbeck broke the deadlock on the hour with a firm header from Cleverley's right wing cross. Welbeck was also heavily involved in the second goal as his back-heel wrong footed Tottenham's defence and Anderson slotted the ball into an empty net. Rooney then grabbed his second of the season as he nodded home Ryan Giggs' cross from seven yards out. Earlier on Monday United confirmed they have signed a four-year sponsorship with express and logistics company DHL. The deal, worth $16.5 million a year according to British newspaper The Financial Times, will see the DHL logo appear on all United's training kit.",7,7.579178015456402
c0f937ec4dfa432d315db1b3be1ca09ef5d8384c,CNN,"(CNN) -- Interpol, at the request of a Swedish court looking into alleged sex crimes from earlier this year, has put WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on its most-wanted listed. The Stockholm Criminal Court two weeks ago issued an international arrest warrant for Assange on probable cause, saying he is suspected of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force in August incidents. Sweden asked Interpol, the international police organization, to post a ""Red Notice"" after a judge approved a motion to bring him into custody. The ""Red Notice"" is not an international arrest warrant. It is an advisory and request, issued to 188 member countries ""to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition,"" according to Interpol. The Swedish court ordered Assange, 39, formally arrested in his absence, which requires Swedish authorities anywhere in the world to detain Assange if they come across him. Sweden's director of prosecutions, Marianne Ny, had requested the arrest-in-absence. ""The background is that he has to be heard in this investigation and we haven't been able to get a hold of him to question him,"" Ny said at the time. Assange faces five counts that appear related to two incidents, according to the request Ny filed with the court. He faces one count of rape and one count of sexual molestation related to an instance around August 17 in Enkoping, just outside Stockholm. He then faces two counts of sexual molestation between August 13 and 18 in Stockholm, and one count of illegal use of force between August 13 and 14, also in the capital. Assange could be sentenced to at least two years in prison if convicted, according to the document. Assange, an Australian, was rejected for permanent residency in Sweden in October. Swedish Migration Board official Gunilla Wikstrom said his application failed to fulfill all the requirements but declined to give details. On Monday, Ecuador invited Assange to come to Quito to discuss documents leaked on the site relating to Ecuador and other Latin American countries, according to a statement from the country's foreign ministry. The ministry also offered to process a request for residency ""in accordance with the country's current laws."" In a November news release, Assange's British lawyer said the sex-crime charges stem from consensual sexual relationships his client had with two women. ""Only after the women became aware of each other's relationships with Mr. Assange did they make their allegations against him,"" lawyer Mark Stephens said in the statement. Stephens also said neither he nor Assange ""have ever received a single written word, at any time, in any form, from Swedish authorities on the Swedish investigation against our client."" The media has been the only way they've learned substantial information about the investigation, Stephens said. He called it ""a clear contravention to Article 6 of the European Convention, which states that every accused must be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."" Swedish prosecutors announced over the summer they were investigating Assange in two separate cases of rape and molestation. Ny said then there was reason to believe a crime had been committed, but that more investigation was necessary before she could make a final decision. Assange has maintained he is innocent, telling the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera the accusations were a ""smear campaign.""",1,7.9149799500969165

From now on, the Missouri State Fair won't allow any rodeo cowboys or clowns from the state's association to take part unless they all undergo ""sensitivity training."" And that's just part of the fallout from the Saturday incident in which a clown wearing an Obama mask held a broom descending from his backside while a voice said, ""Hey, I know I'm a clown. He's just running around acting like one. Doesn't know he is one."" Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, has resigned. Rodeo clown Tuffy Gessling has apologized. He told Missouri news outlet digitalburg.com that he was the one whose voice was heard at the event, and that he never meant to offend. ""It was a colleague of mine that was dressed up. I am the rodeo clown making jokes,"" he said. Gessling did not immediately return a message Thursday from CNN requesting comment. U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican known as a provocateur, has invited the clown -- whose name he did not yet know -- to come perform in his own district. ""Liberals want to bronco bust dissent. But Texans value speech, even if its speech they don't agree with,"" Stockman said. After video of the event caught attention on YouTube, fair officials and politicians -- both Democrats and Republicans -- slammed the portrayal of the president. So did some attendees, such as Perry Bream, who said, ""It wasn't clean; it wasn't fun. It was awful; it was sickening. It was racist."" Sensitivity training: PC overload? The Missouri State Fair Commission announced it was permanently banning ""this rodeo clown from ever participating"" again. It did not name the clown. That behavior, during the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association's Finals Rodeo, was ""unacceptable,"" the commission said. Before it will consider contracting with the association again, ""they must provide evidence to the director of the Missouri State Fair that they have proof that all officials and subcontractors of the MRCA have successfully participated in sensitivity training,"" the commission wrote in a news release. The conservative news outlet The Blaze called the demand ""political insanity."" A Facebook page supporting Gessling had more than 50,000 likes by Thursday morning. On Twitter, some people argued that being offended by a rodeo clown is ""ridiculous."" But others disagreed. ""The sensitivity is needed by those fair planners who approved this act as representative of all Missourians,"" wrote Lisa Robinson. The Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association issued a brief statement apologizing to those offended by any performances at the rodeo. The Missouri State Fair Commission and the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association did not immediately respond Thursday to CNN's requests for comment. Ex-official fears losing school job . Ficken, who stepped down Monday evening as president of the MRCA, has been threatened physically in the wake of the incident, CNN affiliate KDSK reported. He fears he may lose his job as superintendent of the Boonville R-1 School District, which is investigating whether he was involved. ""He's shaking like a small dog passing razor blades,"" Ficken's lawyer, Albert Watkins, told the station. Ficken announced special guest ""President Obama"" at the rodeo. At one point, he said, ""Watch out for that bull, Obama,"" but otherwise he was not part of the performance, according to Watkins. Gessling, meanwhile, told digitalburg.com he's been a rodeo clown throughout his career, and that it's what he loves to do. ""Making fun of political and famous people is kind of the platform,"" he said. ""... I've never tried to dishonor or disrespect anyone, so the whole thing was not meant to be racist or disrespectful. I was just trying to make people laugh.""",1,9.363453516337465
1e4b90647f0bd87ab9a9fe2ccbfd478a4670c092,CNN,"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Typhoon Megi cut a deadly path into Asia on Friday, triggering mudslides that killed seven people and trapped more than 400 others in automobiles in Taiwan, officials said. At least 23 people, including 19 passengers on a tour bus, remained missing Friday night, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported. Rescuers were searching for the missing and providing food to other stranded tourists trapped in the mountainous region of northeastern Taiwan. Helicopters were able to evacuate about 70 people, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The driver and a passenger of a second tour bus were also listed as missing Friday after their vehicle was buried by a landslide, CNA reported. Soldiers were deployed to rescue those trapped, including about 200 visitors from China, said Cai Min, a spokesman for Taiwan's National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission. More than two dozen travelers had been rescued by late afternoon Friday, officials said. The rock slides happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan, Cai said. Megi, which killed at least 11 people in the Philippines, is expected to reach the Asian continent in southern China early Saturday, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. On the streets of Hong Kong, there were no signs of the typhoon yet. ""Although it is difficult to predict Megi's exact track, the public should stay alert and attend to their personal safety. They should stay away from the shoreline, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities and ensure drains are not blocked,"" acting Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said. As precautions, crews in Hong Kong were deployed to pile sandbags, inspect and trim trees and check drains. Temporary shelters were being opened, and myriad boats were moored. Megi may be the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, the state-run Xinhua news agency has said. In southern China, strong gales arrived ahead of Megi. Domestic and international flights have been cancelled, and ferry services have been suspended in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan, state-run China Daily said. In Guangdong, crews have fanned out to inspect reservoirs, dikes and water-conservation projects, in an effort to prevent storm-related injuries and deaths. Nearly 130,000 fishing boats have been recalled in Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and more than 150,000 people have fled for safety in Fujian, according to Xinhua. Officials have issued the highest of four warnings, bracing for possible devastation in coastal areas, Xinhua said. The warning allows local officials six hours to evacuate residents, close schools and airports, and recall vessels that are considered at risk. On Thursday in the Philippines, lawmakers placed the province of Pangasinan under a state of emergency, to help municipalities recover from Megi, which was known in the Philippines as Typhoon Juan. The typhoon affected an estimated 258,844 Filipinos, leaving thousands homeless. CNN's Helena Hong contributed to this report.",2,9.129394599175729
f71ab1608f6454e4e407dd9c60616d06df3a24ed,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""Nice guys finish last"" is a mantra often preached in sport and business. Where golf is concerned, it would seem ""nice guys"" finish second. And they even manage to smile. Adam Scott and In-Kyung Kim both won plenty of admirers for their sportsmanship and grace during two of the sport's blue riband major tournaments this year. The only drawback was, all that praise came after agonizing defeats. For Scott, an Australian ranked sixth in the men's game who has long been tipped for major success, July's British Open tested his ability to swallow the bitter pills so often served up on golf's greens and fairways. He held a four-shot lead going into the final round, but bogeyed the last four holes and handed the title to veteran South African Ernie Els. His capitulation followed in the tradition of his compatriot Greg Norman, one of the greatest golfers of the 1980s and early '90s -- but a player who famously ""choked"" on several big occasions. ""I think the emotions shown in golf are different to other sports,"" the 32-year-old Scott told CNN when asked about how he was able to remain dignified in the face of abject disappointment at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. He congratulated Els with a brave if rueful smile and carried out his duties to face the seemingly endless stream of media requests. ""It has always been referred to as a gentleman's game, but I think it has got more to do with how you're brought up and your influences,"" Scott said. ""I certainly feel like my parents have brought me up well, but also I had good role models that I looked up to as a kid. ""Certainly Greg Norman, I saw him win hundreds of tournaments and lose some big ones, but I think he handled himself well in those situations too, so like you do when you're a kid you always try to mimic those you look up to."" Norman won his first major in 1986, a decade after turning professional. However, that year he led all four majors going into the final round, but came away with just a British Open victory -- his first of two Claret Jugs. The ""Great White Shark"" was runner-up at no less than seven major tournaments. Scott, who tied for second at last year's Masters, collapsed over his putter at Royal Lytham after blowing his biggest chance yet of a breakthrough win. ""I think I was a little numb from shock that I might have lost,"" he explained. ""I felt like I played like a winner the whole week and even with a couple of mistakes coming in it didn't feel horrendous out on the course. ""There is only one shot I was really, really disappointed with and that was the shot into the 17th green. I wasn't really in that much trouble on the last few holes other than the 17th where I was in the long grass. ""That ends up putting me in quite an awkward position to close the tournament. That is probably the one shot I would like to take over again. But other than that I don't think I would do anything different."" Kim, known as ""I.K.,"" is one of a troop of promising female golfing talents emerging from Asia. The South Korean looked set to announce her arrival on the world stage when she was stood over a one-foot putt at the 18th to win her first major at the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April. The ball rolled around the lip of the cup but refused to sink, coming to a stop outside of the hole. Somehow Kim had missed and, in a cruel coincidence, she was forced into a playoff with compatriot Yoo Sun-Young which she duly lost. ""I was disappointed right after it happened,"" the 24-year-old told CNN. ""I get this question a lot ... I am competitive, but from my point of view you can't really attach your emotion to a result. It is something you can't control."" Separating her emotions from her golf is something Kim has worked on throughout her career, using a mental coach to help her hone her craft. ""All we can control is the process and how hard we work, which we do every day,"" the world No. 18 explained. ""I feel like I worked really hard through that tournament and I stayed with my process and everything was good. I moved on."" These techniques involve learning to appreciate the good and the bad. ""To smile more often, to enjoy,"" Kim said. ""I sometimes forget what I can control and what I can't -- they remind me."" Kim's ability to perform in golf's most pressurized situations has been called into question. The playoff at the Kraft Nabisco Championship was the third of her career, and her third defeat. ""I've always been really bummed out after the 18th hole and gone into the playoff without preparing,"" Kim said. ""That is something I have been working on, to control emotion after whatever happened. ""After you have finished it is tough to go and do a playoff, there is nothing you can think about before. That is something I have to work on."" It has been two and a half years since Kim last won an event, the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in November 2010. Kim picked up a cool $220,000 for winning the tournament in Guadalajara, and she chose to donate all of it to charity. ""I like competition, but it is just a different feeling helping someone,"" said Kim, who has earned more than $5 million since turning pro in 2007. ""I feel like I can help by playing golf. ""Without a lot of good people around me I wouldn't be able to do it, so I'm fortunate and I wanted to share the win. I always dreamed about helping other people and I had an opportunity."" Like Kim, Scott is also without a win in 2012. The Adelaide native still has the chance to address that -- this week he lines up at the $7 million WGC-HSBC Champions event in China, then goes to Singapore before returning home for two of Australia's biggest tournaments. ""Playing at home is a big deal for me, I certainly want to perform,"" said Scott, who has earned more than $28 million on the U.S. PGA Tour. ""I'm also quite motivated because I feel like I've played a lot of good golf this year to not have a win and I'd really like to finish the year off by winning one, or two or more of these tournaments. ""I still view (the British Open) as the highlight of my year. To play so well, that's what I've been trying so long to do in majors, and finally it has happened. ""I didn't come out as a champion, but if I can repeat that kind of preparation and play then I'm sure if give myself another chance I'm going to win a major or two."" Kim has won three times on the LPGA Tour, and once on the European Ladies' circuit, but is cautious about her chances of ending her title drought. ""Golf is a mystery,"" she said ahead of this week's Mizuno Classic in Japan. ""Nobody knows how to play this game perfectly and I don't think anyone has ever done it. You play four rounds every week and it is very hard to keep that momentum going. ""You have to do a lot of work, it might come out this weekend, you never know. I'll do my best, there are things I need to improve but there are things I'm doing well. ""You want to win, but it's difficult, being reminded it has been two years since you won! It's not easy, but for me I work really hard. I'm very happy with everything, so hopefully I can win more tournaments by the end of this year.""",7,7.94392294481574
978857fe5f70d2cf497792f30424458c79360c5a,CNN,"(CNN) -- A large group of Baltimore corrections officers and members of a notorious prison gang have been working together to peddle drugs, phones and sex inside the city's jail, prosecutors say. But an indictment released this week is another shot, prosecutors say, in putting an end to it. An indictment, announcing charges on 14 more Baltimore corrections officers, reads like script from the now defunct HBO crime drama ""The Wire."" But the U.S. Attorney's Office for Maryland says this drama involving prison gang , the Black Guerrilla Family, and a growing number of Baltimore jail guards has gone on for too long. ""Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,"" said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein seemed to mean that literally and figuratively, court documents show. According to one indictment, alleged gang member Tavon White had a sexual relationship with four jail guards while he was incarcerated. He impregnated all four of them and they all helped him smuggle items in prison, according to the indictment. One of the guards had ""Tavon"" tattooed on her wrist, the indictment said. In January, White summed up his standing in the prison while talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in, the indictment says . ""This is my jail. You understand that? I'm dead serious ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody, it's gonna come to me. Before (somebody) stab somebody, they gotta run it through me,"" White said according to the indictment. Correctional officers were allegedly ""bribed"" to smuggle in drugs, cell phones and other prohibited objects, which they hid underneath their clothes, ""inside body cavities,"" even in sandwiches. New Orleans jail video shows drugs, guns, filth . Some inmates who weren't part of the gang had to pay protection money -- or more accurately, their relatives on the outside did -- authorities claim. ""Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships, as well as bribes, and that some officers traded sex for money,"" the U.S. Attorney's office said in its news release. The end result was what Rosenstein's office called a ""criminal organization"" operating inside jails ""enabling (participants) to make large amounts of money through drug trafficking, robbery, assault, extortion, bribery, witness retaliation, money laundering and obstruction of justice."" The investigation first came to light in April with the announcement of the first round of arrests. In all, 44 people have been indicted on federal charges. Twenty seven of them are Baltimore correctional officers, CNN affiliate WJZ reported. Is in-jail night club inmate's latest perk? CNN's Dave Stewart contributed to this report.",1,7.111740139174108
533a22f7a3ca39b00fef550243b14d60b404d290,CNN,"(CNN) -- Kyle Green, a University of Minnesota instructor, feels awful that he asked his sociology class to watch all three presidential debates. He should have checked the calendar first. Each of the debates this month, as well as the vice presidential showdown, falls on crucial game days. The fight for the hearts and minds of voters will be, in many households, a fight for the remote. ""I bet there are a lot of sports fans in my class who will be facing the same dilemma that I am,"" said Green, a rabid sports fan. When President Barack Obama takes on Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in their first debate Wednesday, Major League Baseball will be wrapping up its regular season. 5 things to watch in the first presidential debate . It's an especially important day for Yankees, Orioles, Rangers and Athletics fans as their teams vie for first place in their respective divisions. Eight days later, the October 11 vice presidential debate falls on the same day as the Thursday night football game between the Steelers and Titans. The NFL's ""Thursday Night Football"" has been delivering strong numbers this year, and last Thursday's Browns-Ravens game ranked first among cable TV programs for the night. When Romney and Obama face off a second time on October 16, they will compete with a Major League Baseball playoff game. Last year, an average of 7.1 million viewers watched a playoff game. And the final presidential debate on October 22 falls on a Monday during an NFL game between historical rivals the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears. Judging by past numbers, the debates will likely win out. Some 56 million people watched the final debate between Obama and Sen. John McCain on October 15, 2008. Average viewership for a typical Monday Night Football game is about 13 million. But the numbers don't speak to the anxiety some will feel Wednesday. New York actor Markus Potter, like many Yankees fans, is torn. The Yanks are trying to fight off the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League East championship. And the game will be in its final innings as the debate begins. 7-Eleven election accurately predicts presidential election winner . ""Always rough when presidential politics and baseball compete,"" Potter said. He says he'll have the TV tuned to the debate and his laptop to the game, switching his attention between the two. ""This just means I have to turn off the Twitter so nothing is given away in either game,"" he said. ""And yes, I do refer to them both as 'games.'"" Denver-area baseball writer Jonah Keri will be contending with a third distraction, albeit a pleasant one. Wednesday is also the birthday of his 3-year old twins. ""I will be lighting candles, watching the debate and the games at the same time,"" he said. ""I will have the computer and the TV going at the same time,"" he said. "" I imagine in this era of multitasking, many will be doing this."" Last month, the NFL rescheduled its season-opener to avoid competing with Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was a tit-for-tat gesture. In September 2011, Obama moved up his much-anticipated jobs speech to Congress by an hour prior to the start of that year's NFL's season-opener. But there are no such concessions planned this month. Which leaves sports fans who are into politics to engage in a game of their own: juggling. Photos: The first televised debates .

75045b4d2f609c7c4218b9d542dd5f85d18c19ef,CNN,"La Jolla, California (CNN)A black-and-white photo shows the 16-year-old ballerina at her prime, mere months before her world would be destroyed. She is dressed in a bathing suit, smiling radiantly while performing a gymnastic split. Edith Eva Eger says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush: a Jewish boy named Imre. He, like so many others, would not survive the Holocaust. ""I had my 17th birthday in Auschwitz,"" Eger says. Seventy years later, Eger appears frail at first glance, until she astounds a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder-high. The 87-year old says her fondest childhood memories still revolve around dancing and training to compete for the Hungarian Olympic team as a gymnast. ""But then I was told that I had to train somewhere else because I'm Jewish, and I do not qualify [for the Olympics],"" Eger recalls.  ""My dream was totally shattered."" Eger was a Hungarian Jew, the youngest of three daughters, living in a town called Kosice in what is modern-day Slovakia. Her father was a tailor; her mother, a civil servant. It wasn't until March 1944, late in World War II, that Eger says Hungarian Nazis came to her house and arrested her family. The Jews in Hungary were among the last of Europe's Jewish communities to be targeted by the Nazis. The family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, occupied by Nazi Germany. ""My mom held me in the cattle car,"" Eger recalls. ""And she said, 'We don't know where we're going. We don't know what's going to happen. Just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind.' "" Upon arrival at the camp, Eger said Dr. Joseph Mengele, one of the Auschwitz complex's top medical officers, stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks. ""He pointed to my mom to go to the left, and I followed my mom,"" Eger says.  ""And Dr. Mengele grabbed me -- I never forget that eye contact--  and he said 'You're going to see you mother soon, she's just going to take a shower.' "" It was the last time Eger saw her parents. They died in the gas chambers of Auschwitz along with more than a million other Jews. But that would not be the ballerina's final encounter with the infamous SS doctor who later became known the ""Angel of Death."" ""Dr. Mengele came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained,"" Eger says. Fellow inmates ""volunteered"" Eger to perform for the man who had ordered her parents' death. She asked her captors to play the Blue Danube Waltz as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the Holocaust. ""I was so scared,"" Eger says. ""I closed my eyes, and I pretended that the music was Tchaikovsky, and I was dancing 'Romeo and Juliet' in the Budapest opera house."" The German doctor rewarded the Jewish girl with an extra ration of bread, which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters. Eger says months later, those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through Austria. ""They formed a chair with their arms, and they carried me so I wouldn't die,"" she says, adding, ""Isn't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us?"" Decades after the horrors of the Holocaust, dance is still a passion. Eger's house on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean is decorated with statues of ballerinas.  Every Sunday, she says she goes swing-dancing to the music that American soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in Austria in 1945. ""I want to have a full life, not to be damaged goods,"" she says. Perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of World War II and later blossom as an emigre in the United States. Shortly after the war, Eger met and married a fellow Hungarian Jew who had been a partisan, anti-Nazi fighter.  The young family moved with their infant daughter to the United States to escape communist rule in Hungary. ""She was very shy when I was growing up,"" recalls Eger's eldest daughter, Marianne who says her mother transformed in the 1970s, after a visit to Auschwitz. ""After that, she changed dramatically,"" the daughter says. ""There had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes, and afterwards, it was gone. I think it did free her, and she became who she is now."" It was also in the 1970s that Eger began studying psychology.  Decades later, she still works as a clinical psychologist, running a practice out of her home in La Jolla.  Her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. ""She evolved at a time as a psychologist when PTSD wasn't even on the map,"" says Dr. Saul Levine, professor emeritus in psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego, who has known and worked with Eger for more than 20 years. ""She is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way, as well as in a deeply personal way,"" Levine said. Throughout her career in psychology, Eger has done extensive consulting work with the U.S. military, treating American veterans of wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. She has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse. ""Auschwitz gave me a tremendous gift in some ways, that I can guide people to have resilience and perseverance,"" Eger says. In time, Eger also become a motivational public speaker, performing a Ted Talk and giving speeches at schools and universities.  She litters her Hungarian-accented English with aphorisms aimed at mental healing. ""Self love is self care,"" she tells patients.  ""The biggest concentration camp is in our mind."" ""She blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy,"" Levine says, recalling the first time he saw Eger speaking to an audience.  ""She is a force of nature."" Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, this Holocaust survivor's greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great-grandchildren. ""That's the best revenge to Hitler I can think of,"" says the dancer, pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great-grandchildren in her office.",3,9.730634816596188
3918e8e6cb093c427289a9acc24c2c52dda48c6e,CNN,"(CNN) -- Looks like it could take awhile for new Twitter user Rupert Murdoch to get the hang of things. For starters, the 80-year-old media mogul, who signed up for Twitter over the New Year's holiday, might want to make sure the people he follows are real. As of Monday, the oft-controversial Murdoch was following a grand total of four people on the social networking site. One of them, at first glance, appears to be Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page. Except that it's not Larry Page but a parody account that's part of a university project. ""This is a fake account - part of a series created for @plaidavenger's class at Virginia Tech,"" the owner of the account tweeted Monday in reply to a follower asking about it after seeing an interaction with Murdoch. It wasn't clear Monday whether the News Corporation CEO was aware of the misunderstanding. The Twitter chat started with ""Plaid Larry Page"" welcoming the magnate to the site. ""Welcome @rupertmurdoch to Twitter! Could Google+ be next?"" he wrote Sunday. Murdoch's reply: ""Maybe soon, but I'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what I may really say!"" Indeed. Less than a day into his Twitter tenure, Murdoch had been publicly chastised by what appeared to be his wife (fellow Twitter newbie Wendi Deng) for a tweet saying that ""maybe Brits have too many holidays for [a] broke country."" He quickly backed down, deleting the tweet in question. [UPDATE: Both Twitter and the account owner have acknowledged that the Deng account is a fake not really run by her. Twitter had mistakenly given the account ""verified"" status shortly after it was created.] . Murdoch tweets support for Rick Santorum . It's hard to figure out what to make of Murdoch's other three follows, other than that he appears to be taking his new venture into Web and social-media culture seriously. Some have ventured it's part of a ""charm offensive"" after a year in which he was embroiled in a phone-hacking controversy at his now-defunct ""News of the World"" newspaper. Alan Sugar, a British magnate and reality-TV judge, as well as Twitter nemesis of CNN's own Piers Morgan, is one of them. The other two are Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Zynga CEO Mark Pincus -- the man behind such online time-killers as ""FarmVille"" and ""Mafia Wars.""",6,7.5307744208796255
6e746ff70c1bc9f5c77dfa75edaefbcbdeda0734,CNN,"(CNN) -- Investigators asked for help Thursday as they searched for a man seen in a mall in Littleton, Colorado, shortly before what they described as a possible attempt to bomb the shopping center on the 12th anniversary of the shooting at nearby Columbine High School. Authorities told reporters at a news conference that the man they are seeking is a ""person of interest,"" and they asked for help from the news media and public in identifying him. No evidence exists so far of a link to the Columbine shootings, Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink said, but he acknowledged the possibility was on the minds of law enforcement officials. ""There's not a definite link that we have right now to anything at Columbine other than the date,"" Mink said, adding that the April 20th anniversary of the shootings ""is fresh on everyone's mind."" A security camera shows the man sought by authorities in the mall just minutes before a security guard noticed a fire. Investigators say that fire may have been part of an attempt to detonate explosives. The incident happened Wednesday at the Southwest Plaza Mall, less than two miles from Columbine High School. It came on the 12th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine that left 12 students and a teacher dead at the hands of two other students, who then killed themselves. ""It's sort of scary, but it's also ... terrible,"" said David Cullen, author of the book ""Columbine"" about the massacre. ""It's like attacking people who are in mourning."" Law-enforcement officials released surveillance camera images of a man carrying a white plastic bag at the mall around noon. He was in a part of the mall that the public does not usually access. Only minutes after he was seen in the area, a security guard noticed a small fire there and quickly put it out.  A subsequent search turned up explosives, said Jacki Kelley of the Jefferson County Sheriff's office. ""The propane tanks and the pipe bomb were literally together,"" she told reporters Wednesday night at a news conference. The mall was quickly evacuated and no one was hurt, authorities said. Mink said that the mall had been thoroughly searched and was allowed to reopen on Thursday. None of the authorities who spoke at the news conference provided further information on the explosives found at the scene, saying they needed to interview more people and didn't want details reported in the media to influence any responses they might get. The situation could have been much worse, said Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI. ""Depending (on) if it went off and actively combusted as what it was set to do, it could have been more serious than it was,"" he said at an earlier news conference, adding that it appeared that the pipe bomb was supposed to be a trigger to detonate the propane tanks. ""This was potentially devastating to a very high populated area, and very difficult to ignore the day that today is,"" Kelley added. ""We're not ignoring that.  The date is significant to Colorado history,"" Joly added. Schools in the area were briefly put on lockdown, according to the sheriff's office. Columbine High School was already closed Wednesday, for what its school calendar called a staff development day. The person authorities want to talk to is described as a white male with gray hair and a silver mustache, the FBI said. He wore a dark cap with a light-colored logo on the front, a gray and white horizontally striped shirt, a dark jacket, jeans and dark-colored shoes. ""We're not sure if he's a suspect or a possible witness,"" Kelley said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.",1,9.649599787855397
814fc9a7f861c611e01bacee5e04f301cca5257e,CNN,"(CNN) -- That's right, I said it. And I mean it. Roland Martin says the GOP is missing its chance to win black voters. The GOP as a whole is completely scared of black voters, and the actions by the front-runners for the party's 2008 nomination show they are continuing the same silly political games the party has played for years. Oh, don't bother tossing out the appointments of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state by Bush. Yes, they are African-American. But I'm speaking of the party. Ever since Richard Nixon ran for the White House, the GOP has run on a ""Southern Strategy,"" meant to alienate blacks in an effort to garner white voters. They've worked the strategy to perfection. When he was head of the Republican National Committee, Ken Mehlman apologized for that strategy as he sought to make inroads among black voters. Republicans will tell you they are the party of Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but their outreach efforts to black voters are lacking. Oh, yes, I know. Democrats have a stranglehold on the black vote, receiving upward of 90 percent in national elections. A significant part of that is a result of the party seeing blacks as the backbone of the party. But the reality is that when you have only one party that truly makes a play for those voters, of course you will see such disparities! That's why it's dumb, dumb, and dumber for the leading GOP candidates to skip Thursday's debate hosted by Tavis Smiley and airing on PBS. Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson and Sen. John McCain have all cited ""scheduling conflicts"" as the reason for their lack of attendance to debate at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, even though Smiley personnel tell me they began discussions with then-RNC head Mehlman in February 2006. When the debate was announced earlier this year, along with a Democratic forum held in June at Howard University, the RNC promised their candidates would speak. But those of us who follow politics knew that wasn't going to happen. This summer, all of the Republican candidates, save Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, skipped the NAACP and the National Urban League conventions. OK, I get the former, but the Urban League? President Bush has spoken there several times as president! The GOP keeps blowing a big opportunity by ignoring blacks. And what about the debate sponsored by Spanish language TV station Univision? Only McCain accepted the invite. Today's generation of blacks and Latinos shouldn't be seen as the same as their parents. An increasing number of people are refusing to identify themselves with a party, and looking at issues. Latinos have been a huge part of the Republican outreach, but the immigration debate is turning that in a different direction. Why should the GOP talk to black voters, and what would they talk about? First, I can tell you that immigration is huge in the black community, and gets folks riled up in a hurry (you ought to see my talk show lines when this comes up). Education and health care are also major. And every GOP debate has been about faith in the public square, and we know that plays well with black voters. Now, when it comes to the war in Iraq, the GOP can forget that tune. No one is listening. And they are completely uneven on the issue of civil rights. Here is an example that further explains the GOP's stupidity on this topic. Several years ago, a Republican in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was trying to unseat then-Rep. Martin Frost, a heavily entrenched Democrat. That summer, a series of black churches were being burned. My good friend, Michael Williams, a third-generation black Republican, was planning to hold a fundraiser at his home for the GOP candidate. He called the campaign and said it would be a good idea for the candidate to make a statement on the burnings, condemning them and saying it didn't make sense. The campaign said no. Williams called back and made the suggestion again, and the response was they didn't want to seem as if they were pandering to the black community. He laughed at that because the campaign was bringing then-Rep. J.C. Watts, a prominent black Republican, to visit black churches with the candidate. Hello! That's pandering. So Williams told his wife, Donna, what the candidate said. She replied, ""Any man who is such a coward that he can't speak against churches being burned is not welcome in my home."" The fundraiser was called off. Here was a simple opportunity to actually show that he cared, but the candidate was so scared to say something, he turned off a campaign donor. Will speaking at one debate turn around decades of black support for the Democrats? Nope. But not speaking will just mean business as usual, and the GOP needs less of that. Roland S.

f3944992881be4f38c7b2693a8703e1721897aa9,CNN,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The consequences of ordering the military to crack down on anti-government demonstrations more than two years ago has come back to haunt the former Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Thai authorities have charged Abhisit and his former deputy with murder in relation to the killing of Pan Kumkong, a taxi driver, amid the unrest that brought chaos to the streets of the capital city, Bangkok, in 2010. The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) said Thursday that the charges against Abhisit and Suthep Thaungsuban concern orders to soldiers to use live ammunition in the area were Pan was shot. If convicted, they would face the punishment of death or life in prison. The Court of Justice ruled in September that the taxi driver's death resulted from acts carried out by the military under instructions from the Center for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation, a temporary task force set up by Abhisit. He and Suthep have been summoned to hear the charges on Wednesday, said Thairt Pengdit, director general of the DSI. Political tensions erupted in early 2010 with protesters demanding that Abhisit step down. He resisted the calls, and clashes between his supporters and those of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, turned violent. Abhisit sent in government troops to quell the long-running protests in Bangkok. More than 90 people died and hundreds were injured in the street battles that followed, one of the bloodiest episodes in recent Thai history. In July 2011, Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was elected as prime minister, defeating Abhisit.",1,8.839292421535923
c8db0e10a3c13799ef7cc7ce37a0bc1c44856696,CNN,"(CNN) -- Inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in Georgia that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak, according to reports released Monday by the state Department of Agriculture. A salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people, the CDC says. But the owner of the Blakely, Georgia, plant -- Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America -- described the problems as ""relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" PCA this month stopped production at the Blakely plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after July 1, 2008. The New York Times reported Monday that Georgia agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the Blakely plant. Citing an inspection report from August 23, 2007, the Times noted at least three incidences in which ""food-contact surfaces"" were ""not properly cleaned and sanitized."" In an apparent response to the Times article, PCA released a statement saying, ""When the observations were noted during inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible."" The statement, which PCA sent to CNN accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last October, said ""the most recent inspection observations by the state [the October inspection report] were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" In the October 23, 2008 report, an inspector said she found ""mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room."" The report did not specify the amount of mildew. The report continued with the notation, ""Correct By: 11/05/2008,"" but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow-up inspection occurred. Moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago. That outbreak was traced to a different Georgia peanut processing plant.

a35a9142e91cc5d78c4616ce9ac43112e21727b7,CNN,"(CNN) -- Nakoula Basseley Nakoula -- who a year ago was, arguably, the most hated man in the Islamic world -- will soon be a free man. The 56-year-old Egyptian-American behind the inflammatory film ""The Innocence of Muslims"" is set to be released from a residential re-entry facility, or a halfway house, in Southern California on Thursday, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross. He's been there since being released from prison in May. His incarceration wasn't directly related to the movie he produced, though it did shine a strong spotlight on him in more ways than one. Yet his actions producing ""The Innocence of Muslims"" did violate the terms of his probation for a 2010 bank fraud violation, authorities found. Among other things, Nakoula was barred from using aliases -- yet court documents stated that he used at least 17 false names. He was also barred from accessing computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. ""The Innocence of Muslims"" notably was posted on the video-sharing website YouTube. Film's producer ordered held without bail . The film got little attention when it was initially posted online, though things changed considerably when Egyptian media highlighted it in September 2012. Violent protests subsequently erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Some of the demonstrations targeted U.S. diplomatic missions under the false presumption that the U.S. government was behind the production. The anger faded, however, particularly after Nakoula's arrest on September 27, 2012. In an interview last month with CNN's Jake Tapper, Nakoula said he was ""shocked"" by the uproar -- saying he never thought his movie could cause anyone trouble or get anyone killed. Filmmaker: Obama administration was irresponsible . A Coptic Christian from Egypt, Nakoula insisted his film is not against Islam, but against terrorism. He said the movie is political more than religious and claimed to have Muslim friends. ""I am against the culture itself, not the religion,"" he said.",1,7.033778080010413
9af08cd1ae23b22cecd565d5a3cd17dd86227e12,CNN,"(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S. Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name. He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.",1,6.523358767655713
33ea674fce31a87721283b7f6dd78d1753a4aac8,CNN,"(CNN)  -- The woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal, doctors warned Wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care. The bathroom used by Elizabeth Fritzl, who was held captive for more than two decades, and her three children. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Hans-Heinz Lenze, the head of local social services said the family was ""doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances"" and said any change of identity would be the family's decision. Elizabeth Fritzl -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged, handcuffed and locked up by her father, Josef Fritzl, as an 18-year-old. Repeatedly raped, she gave birth to seven children by Fritzl, one of whom died as an infant. Three of the children -- Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5 -- remained imprisoned underground with their mother. The other three lived in an apartment upstairs with Fritzl and his wife who believed Elizabeth had abandoned them after running away from home. Elizabeth and five of the children were continuing to receive treatment at a local clinic near Amstetten after being reunited on Sunday. Kerstin, whose hospitalization at the weekend finally brought the family's plight to the attention of authorities, remained in a coma at a nearby hospital. ""It is astonishing how easy it worked that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together,"" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said. But Kepplinger warned that the family would require extensive counseling. ""We're talking of 20 years of darkness, incest and its effects and other illnesses they might have suffered from."" Kepplinger said the two sets of children were tentatively getting to know one another, adding that the two boys who had lived underground had an unusual way of communicating with each other. A policeman who had accompanied the boys to hospital after their discovery on Sunday said the pair had ""screamed with excitement"" during the car journey as they experienced the outside world for the first time. ""The two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before,"" said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz. ""The real world was completely alien to them... We had to drive very slowly with them because they cringed at every car light and every bump. It was as if we had just landed on the moon."" In an interview with the Austrian newspaper, Oesterreich, psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences. Another psychologist, Bernd Prosser, told Austrian television that it would be impossible for the four held prisoner underground to lead normal lives. ""I am afraid it is too late for that."" Kampusch, the Austrian girl abducted as a 10-year-old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007, also offered her help to the family on Tuesday, but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care. ""Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them,"" said Kampusch, now 20, in an interview with Austrian TV station Puls 4. ""I believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were, but that was probably impossible. This case is not like mine, where that was not my environment. They were born there and I can imagine that there is a strong attachment to that place."" E-mail to a friend .",8,6.407816468465494
f4ec8f8c6fc58713afaad4e5d9a8f3dc59b6e719,CNN,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Centro. Alba. Zombie Burger. The dining scene in Des Moines is pretty hot these days. So why did nearly a thousand Iowans pay $100-a-pop last Saturday night to chew wilted salads and poke at dried-out chicken breast with a bunch of strangers inside a drafty conventional hall? Politics, of course. It was the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, the party's big annual fundraiser and final cheerleading session before next Tuesday's midterm elections. We were there for this week's edition of ""Hambycast."" Even as modern developments like Twitter, super PACs and micro-targeting erode the the quaint traditions of politics, the ""rubber chicken circuit"" endures. It's a durable fixture of campaign life, as time-honored as the gaffe and gotcha question. Democrats have their J-J Dinners, and Republicans convene at Lincoln Day Dinners or Reagan Day Dinners. There are variations of the form depending on local traditions: My favorite political banquet name is the Ruby Laffoon Dinner, held yearly by the Hopkins County Democratic Party in Kentucky and named in honor of the state's 43rd governor. But the pageantry is the same wherever you travel: Candidates and elected officials speak, rally faithful partisans and raise cash for the party organization. In places like Iowa and New Hampshire, the dinners take on an added importance: Ambitious pols with their eyes on the White House come here to test drive their national appeal and forge relationships in crucial early nominating states. On Saturday, we heard Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Senator and possible presidential candidate in 2016 or 2020, speak at the J-J in Des Moines. She was hardly the first White House aspirant to do so. ""He hadn't said he would run in 1972, but there he was on the rubber chicken circuit, glad-handing county chairmen and looking for early commitments,"" the legendary AP scribe Walter Mears wrote four decades ago in a profile of Ed Muskie, the Maine Senator who never made it to the Oval Office. The rubber chicken phrase surfaces across the decades in political journalism, and with good reason — the chow ain't grand. On Saturday, the menu was roughly the same as any J-J Dinner — or Lincoln Day Dinner or Reagan Dinner on the GOP side — you'd find in counties and states from Maine to Hawaii. There was some kind of mass-produced chicken breast, slathered with some indistinguishable sauce, accompanied by a passel of steamed vegetables. There was the all-important ""vegan option,"" for those rare Iowa herbivores in the audience. And attendees could choose from an assortment of cake slices that had been sitting out on their banquet tables for several hours before the first speaker even took the stage. But the food isn't why people come. That would be weird. ""If we lose this concept of having political parties, where people can gather and have a platform and join together, we really lose what's been at the core of democracy,"" Klobuchar said when we asked her about the importance of these dinners. ""What's missing of course if when people get there and get elected is their ability to put that aside some and work together.""",3,7.313189188214433
a29e59b3819f0d0b69fa24077366cad371ed2234,CNN,"(CNN) -- New York City plans to move the remains of unidentified victims in the 2001 terror attack to a new resting place within the 9/11 Memorial Museum, officials tell CNN. The roughly 8,000 remains, which are in the custody of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, will be moved to the museum this year, spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said. ""We are making plans, but we are going to notify the families before we make any further announcement,"" she said. The remains will be kept behind a wall in an area off-limits to the public, according to 9/11 museum spokesman Michael Frazier. The museum's website says the wall, which visitors will be able to view, is to be inscribed with the following from the Roman poet Virgil: ""No day shall erase you from the memory of time."" Only medical examiners and families of victims will be given access to the repository, according to the spokesperson for both the museum and the medical examiner's office. The decision to house remains in the museum repository has been controversial. In 2011, 17 families of 9/11 victims filed a petition in court to force the museum to consult with the victims' families before deciding what to do with the remains. They eventually asked for a congressional hearing. Both efforts were unsuccessful. On its website, the museum said the decision to move the remains to the repository at the museum was because of overwhelming feedback received from families after the attacks. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is scheduled to open this spring as part of the part of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. DNA identifications of the unidentified remains will continue in the new repository, according to the museum. In New York, 2,753 people were killed when hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center.

b358ad08408d48a1caa6b74b55c32ad0f128efd2,CNN,"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The recent news item about a Connecticut worker fired for Facebook postings that annoyed her employer, like other accounts of employees sacked for private speech, was bound to draw a lot of attention. Americans hold First Amendment rights to free speech as a kind of sacrosanct birthright, and for many of us the idea that you can lose your job for expressing private thoughts away from work offends the core principle of freedom of expression. In fact, though, firing a worker for off-the-job speech that unsettles an employer is pretty routine, and for the most part very legal. The First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights protect us from infringements on our liberties by acts of government, not from the oppressive acts of nongovernmental actors such as private-sector employers. Combine that with the labor law concept of ""employment at will,"" which makes it possible to fire someone without due process for just about anything short of discrimination, and you are left with an American workplace where free expression has scarcely more moral credibility than employee theft. A particularly eye-catching example is an Alabama woman who lost her job -- with no legal recourse -- during the 2004 election season because her Republican boss didn't like the John Kerry bumper sticker on her car in the factory parking lot. Widespread use by just about everyone of online networks and social media opens new opportunities for workers to engage in personal expressive activity that might arouse the notice and disapproval of one's employer, and by extension opportunities for touchy or paranoid employers to police and punish essentially harmless extracurricular speech. So in a sense, the situation involving Dawnmarie Souza, the Connecticut emergency medical technician fired by an ambulance services firm for posting negative comments about her boss on Facebook, is just the latest skirmish in an ongoing conflict between employers' desire to keep workers in line and the rights of employees to live their private expressive lives without unwarranted employer interference. But there's a wrinkle that makes this case important: the involvement of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which contends that Souza's Facebook comments could be protected activity under labor law. Americans don't enjoy general free speech protections against infringement by a private employer (with some limited exceptions, such as certain kinds of whistle-blowing). But federal labor law does grant union-eligible workers the right to engage in ""concerted activity"" for the purpose of ""mutual aid or protection"" -- essentially, to communicate with each other about working conditions and terms of employment. Those same federal laws bar employers from interfering with workers' efforts to improve their work situations. If Souza had dissed her boss in, say, a blog post or a letter to the editor, her expressive act would likely earn no protection against her employer's wrath. But on Facebook her comments catalyzed responses from and interaction with some of her co-workers. That online ""conversation"" involving Souza and other employees of the same firm is what the NLRB alleges could amount to protected concerted activity. If the courts agree (at this point it's just a charge by the NLRB, with a hearing slated for early next year) then Souza's dismissal was illegal. When this case does reach a courtroom, lawyers will tussle over the nature of social media sites. Does interaction within a closed Facebook circle of friends amount to private conversation, or are negative comments about one's job or boss on Facebook the equivalent of a public statement that could affect a firm's reputation? Does it matter how big one's network is? How many co-workers have to chime in to the conversation to make it ""concerted"" activity? Until this works its way through the courts, employment lawyers are advising corporate clients to ensure that employee policies regarding internet use are not written so broadly that they chill workers' exercise of their associational rights under labor law. Souza's situation turns more on labor law protections than on constitutional free-speech rights because she worked for a private-sector employer. The First Amendment does afford more protection to public-sector workers, but government employees reading this shouldn't get their hopes up. Federal court decisions along with developments in management practice have combined to make even the public-sector workplace rather inhospitable to employee free-speech claims. Consider the cautionary tale of Ashley Payne, a Georgia public school teacher forced to resign last year when administrators learned in an anonymous email about pictures of her on Facebook holding an alcoholic beverage during a trip to Europe. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Payne kept her network settings private, and never friended any students. A year later, as her case crawls through the legal system and she awaits her day in court, Payne is still unable to find a teaching position. A common reaction among working professionals to stories such as Souza's and Payne's is to advise people to manage their online presence and their digital footprints more carefully and prudently. Avoid giving your employer a reason to frown on your online expressive activity, goes the argument, even when you do it on your own time, on your own device, and on private networks. This is reasonable advice to the extent that it equates to ""avoid being really stupid,"" but it's unfortunate advice if it counsels individuals to suppress their own private expressive life as a career strategy. To be sure, employers need not tolerate any and all extracurricular speech by workers that might genuinely pose a legitimate threat to the firm's interests or to its workplace harmony. If I worked for CNN, with a spare-time hobby maintaining the web site timewarnerisevil.com, it certainly shouldn't behoove my employer to retain my services in the name of some abstract notion of off-work freedom of personal expression. Employers need not allow workplaces to become debating societies or free-for-alls for hostility and harassment. But it's troublesome when employers favor a management culture so bent on predictability and control that even mild or tangential departures from expressive conformity are treated with suspicion and rebuke. Employees will kvetch about jobs and bosses until the day there no longer are jobs and bosses, and enlightened employers understand that new technological vehicles for said kvetching will inevitable emerge and evolve. Holding a job should not require giving up your right to an expressive private life, even if you might be prone to the occasional untoward remark about the people who sign your paycheck. Cultivating a thin-skinned managerial impulse to treat workers' expressive activities as existential threats to the enterprise isn't how you manage a workforce; it's how you chase talent away to your competitors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Barry.",4,12.112306355436292

d5567bb68b3e7470311f79655ca6a89cb6d4b991,CNN,"(CNN) -- Authorities looking for Hannah Graham found human remains Saturday on an abandoned property eight miles from where the University of Virginia student was last seen five weeks ago, police said. Chesterfield County Sheriff's Department members participating in the search made the discovery before noon in southern Albemarle County in central Virginia, according to Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo. Shortly thereafter, a detective relayed the news to Graham's parents. ""These are human remains and forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identification...,"" Longo told reporters. ""But nonetheless we wanted to be quick and timely to share that information with the Graham family."" The discovery comes 35 days after Graham was last spotted, on several surveillance cameras, in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. That footage showed her leaving the Tempo Bar at around 2 a.m. on September 13, as well as a man -- later identified by authorities as Jesse Matthew, 32 -- following her. On September 24, Matthew was taken into custody while camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas, some 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. He is the only person detained in connection with Graham's disappearance, charged with abduction with the intent to defile. He has also been linked by forensic evidence to the case of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student who was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29 outside of Charlottesville in October 2009. She was found dead on a nearby farm the following January. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death still is under investigation. Police, though, did recently seize a cab owned by Matthew that he was driving in Charlottesville in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Matthew's next court appearance in relation to Graham's disappearance is scheduled for December 4. Officials didn't say whether charges against anyone were imminent in light of Saturday's discovery. Surviving the 'Murdered Child's Club' 'A great deal of work ahead' Albemarle County Police Chief Steve Sellers did appeal to anyone who was in or knows the area in which the remains were found to contact authorities if they saw ""any suspicious activity"" or ""an individual fitting Jesse Matthew's description in that area about that time."" ""Today's discovery is a significant development, and we have a great deal of work ahead of us,"" said Sellers, noting Graham's case is now considered a ""death investigation."" ""We cannot and we will not jump to any conclusions."" The 18-year-old Graham was in her second year at the University of Virginia -- a member of the ski team and making straight A's, her parents say -- when she was last seen. ""She was extremely smart, very witty, very athletic,"" said Craig Maniglia, the coach of the high school softball team that Graham co-captained in Northern Virginia. Graham's last contact with friends -- telling them she was lost and trying to find a party, according to CNN affiliate WVIR -- came via text message at 1:20 a.m. the morning of September 13. Another Virginia family still seeking answers . Her disappearance prompted a massive search involving more than 1,200 volunteers, not to mention emotional appeals from officials like Longo and Graham's parents. Sunday's scheduled public search of Walnut Creek Park -- not far from where the remains were found -- was canceled, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management said in a statement. ""Authorities are focusing their attention on recent evidence, which limits law enforcement resources necessary to carry out a public search,"" the agency said. Social media commenters saddened . Earlier this week, John and Sue Graham pleaded for help finding their daughter, saying, ""It is heartbreaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. It is within their power ... to end this nightmare for us all."" Her friends hadn't relented, either. In a statement released to CNN, they asked 'that everyone in Charlottesville and surrounding areas be on the lookout for new clues. No clue is too small and every search of personal property, even if it does not yield a result, is helpful."" Their efforts continued as recently as Saturday, with the ""Help Find Hannah Graham"" Facebook page posting pictures of various volunteers handing out ribbons to businesses in downtown Charlottesville. Later in the day, that page was full of heartfelt reactions from friends and strangers alike. One woman wrote, ""Rest in peace beautiful angel."" And a man chimed in, about hearing the news: ""I wept as if she were family."" Coy Barefoot, a member of the University of Virginia adjunct faculty and a local media personality, told CNN that Saturday's discovery -- and the prospect it could contribute to breakthroughs in the cases of other missing women, such as Harrington -- stirred ""a mix of emotions here in Charlottesville."" ""I have seen people crying. I have cried tears myself,"" said Barefoot.

The Seychelles was due to host Sierra Leone in a qualifying game on Saturday, but the tiny island nation's ministries of health and immigration prevented the visiting players from entering the country. At least 525 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone since March, 224 of which have been fatal. Seychelles, which was trailing 2-0 after losing the away leg of the second-round qualifier in Sierra Leone on July 19, has forfeited both the tie and its hopes of reaching next year's tournament finals. Sierra Leone players were on Friday reportedly prevented from boarding a plane at Kenya's Nairobi Airport that would have taken them to the Seychelles. Seychelles Football Federation president Elvis Chetty told CNN that there was little choice but to follow government advice and forfeit the match, which was to be held in the capital Victoria. ""After being advised by the ministry of health to postpone the match for an indefinite period, the ministry of immigration informed us it would not allow the team from Sierra Leone to enter the Seychelles,"" Chetty said. ""Subsequently, the SFF felt it was prudent to forfeit the scheduled match as opposed to asking for a postponement. ""We respect the decisions taken by the authorities to safeguard the health interests of our country. ""Our thoughts are with the Sierra Leone people in their hour of need.""

ae7315ef12a9c472213995cc819429ce129adf63,CNN,"(CNN) -- St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch juggled two roles on Wednesday: overseeing the presentation of evidence in the Michael Brown case to a grand jury and responding to the flurry of attacks and calls for his recusal from the case. McCulloch went on the offensive after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon tried to deflect calls for the prosecutor's ouster by saying it was up to McCulloch to recuse himself. McCulloch's deep ties with local police and perceived favoritism of law enforcement in criminal cases have led to concerns about his ability to be impartial in the Brown case. Should he recuse? In a statement sent to the media on Tuesday night, Nixon said, ""From the outset, I have been clear about the need to have a vigorous prosecution of this case, and that includes minimizing any potential legal uncertainty."" ""I am not asking St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch to recuse himself from this case. There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation, and a special prosecutor be appointed. Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution,"" Nixon said. McCulloch's response: Nixon needs to ""man up."" ""It's the typical Nixon doublespeak,"" McCulloch said during a radio interview with The McGraw Show on KTRS. ""He says nothing and he's ducking."" McCulloch said the state of emergency Nixon declared on Saturday gave the governor authority to remove McCulloch from the case. McCulloch said Nixon should ""just make a decision."" ""He doesn't need a reason,"" McCulloch said to KTRS, ""all he has to do is a simple yes he's out, or no he's not out, and let's move on. The Brown family deserves that and the rest of the community deserves it."" McCulloch firmly stated he is not removing himself from the case. ""I have absolutely no intention of walking away from the duties and responsibilities entrusted to me by the people of this community. I've done it for 24 years,"" he said. The clock is ticking for a decision, according to McCulloch. Now that the presentation has begun, recusing the main prosecutor could complicate matters even more. ""The most devastating thing that could happen, is if a week from now, a month from now he (Nixon) decides that he's taking me off this case and everybody is starting over. Stand up, man up,"" said McCulloch, ""This family deserves nothing less than that."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Grand jury presentation . Wednesday marked the first day of evidence presentation to the grand jury, a process that will likely continue into the fall. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,"" McCulloch said on KTRS. ""Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out, so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we'll go from there."" But not all the evidence is ready to be presented, according to McCulloch, which is why prosecutors will have to present in parts. ""As things are completed they'll be presented to the grand jury,"" said McCulloch during an interview with CNN affiliate KMOV. ""But we want to get the process started, and not wait until absolutely everything is done before we even start it."" Overwhelming Volume of Evidence . The evidence in the shooting death of Michael Brown involves investigations from multiple agencies, including the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis Police Department, FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice. Asked how many witnesses have been interviewed so far, McCulloch told KMOV, ""I don't know. Dozens and dozens, maybe hundreds."" He said the FBI has been successful at locating witnesses in the Canfield apartments, near where Brown was killed. ""The federal government is doing their independent investigation, and so they're also talking to witnesses, and ultimately that will be made available to us,"" McCulloch told KMOV. ""They're doing their own forensic testing. They've done their own or will do their own post-mortem examination, and those results will be provided, all to the grand jury."" Grand jury time line . McCulloch estimated prosecutors will finish presenting the case by mid-October, a time line that brings its own set of challenges with the grand jury calendar, because the current session ends in early September. ""We will be presenting what we can, between now and the end of their term, which is early September,"" McCulloch told KTRS, ""after that, their term is extended just for this case and that's all they will be doing. They can meet for as long as they want, as long as they want to meet."" ""We present the full case to the grand jury and should there be an indictment, the full case will be presented to the trial jury so that they make the decision,"" McCulloch said. ""I don't decide if somebody is guilty or not guilty. I present the evidence to a jury and the jury makes that decision."" Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

3fbd6cd5c4795d7e79890e39f8060a0a80eca9cf,CNN,"(CNN) -- The husband of a pregnant Texas woman -- who he says has been brain dead for seven weeks -- asked a court Tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant. Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""Marlise Munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband contends in the motion. Notably, officials at the Fort Worth, Texas, hospital where 33-year-old Marlise Munoz is have not publicly declared her dead (though they have not disputed her husband's assertions either). Erick Munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him Marlise ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County district attorney's office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit. It is legal counsel for John Peter Smith Hospital ""in a number of civil areas."" Noting it first learned of the legal action just before noon Tuesday, the office said it ""will file a response in due course"" but won't have any further comment now ""because litigation is pending."" Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that states that ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" And last week, Labbe told CNN that the hospital believed ""the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this matter."" Munoz's husband responds by saying that ""Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."" Furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently than a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy. Mom of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law . ""Marlise has a fundamental right to make medical decisions regarding her own body,"" her husband contended in the motion. ""... To take those rights away from Marlise, and force her to be subject to various medical procedures simply because she is pregnant, is a gross violation of her constitutional right."" As the lawsuit details, the story began at 2 a.m. on November 26, when Erick found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor. At the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz claims he was told his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" The family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. In the lawsuit, he claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amount ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" ""Marlise Munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment,"" according to the lawsuit. Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor who helped write the applicable Texas law, said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it. ""She's not a patient anymore,"" Mayo said. ""And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."" But Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said that she thinks the state statute as written is ""ambiguous"" and ""vague."" ""When you have these murky areas, you have to go to court, because courts provide clarity, courts provide direction,"" Hostin said. ""And that's why I think the lawsuit is the right thing ... to jump to the conclusion.""

a281377a3eaa39f616bdefe1f0eb9ed558576608,CNN,"(CNN) -- Police said Thursday that evidence and a surviving victim tie a man killed while trying to rob an Illinois tanning salon to a two-state shooting spree earlier this year. Gary Amaya, 48, was killed Saturday after he walked into LA Tan salon in Orland Park, Illinois, brandishing a .38 Colt revolver. A customer, Jason McDaniel, rushed at Amaya and killed him after turning the gun on him, according to surveillance video. Will County, Illinois, Sheriff Paul Kaupas said Thursday that the weapon used by Amaya in this weekend's botched robbery was similar to the one used in two shootings October 5 along the Illinois-Indiana line. One person was killed and three were wounded in those shootings, police have said. In addition, Amaya's vehicle outside the Orland Park shooting matched one seen in Washington Township, Illinois, and Lowell, Indiana, where the October incidents took place, Kaupas said. The Indiana survivor, too, told detectives it was Amaya who shot him. ""The evidence at this time ... tells us that the suspect that was killed in the armed robbery at Orland Park ... does match the information from the previous homicide-slash-shooting in Lowell, Indiana,"" Kaupas said. Yet Kaupas did not go as far as saying definitively that Amaya was behind all three shootings, noting that he was awaiting results of more forensic tests. Police on Thursday did not expand on widespread reports that the gunman in the first two shootings randomly discussed honey bees before shooting his victims -- leading media to brand him ""the Honey Bee Killer."" But Kaupas did say Amaya previously worked at a hunting lodge in rural Grundy County, Illinois, where he cared for honey bees. Authorities also elaborated on Saturday's botched robbery and shooting. Orland Park Police Chief Tim McCarthy said McDaniel, who was in the shop with a worker, offered Amaya his money and explained that he had a young child. ""The comment by Amaya was, 'Whatever,'"" McCarthy said at the Thursday news conference. ""At that point, both feared for their life, that this was going to be more than a robbery."" Video shows McDaniel, 29, rushing at robber and, during the struggle, Amaya being shot. McDaniel told CNN affiliate WGN that he acted after coming to the conclusion that there was something wrong with Amaya. ""There was no ... hurry,"" McDaniel said. ""He was very calm, like he wanted to hurt somebody -- like that was his intended goal."" This weekend's shooting come more than two months after a gunman killed one construction worker and hurt two in Washington Township. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman struck again -- this time firing on a farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. The farmer talked with police detectives after this weekend's incident. ""Mr. Dahl has unequivocally identified Gary Amaya as the person who shot him,"" Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff Roy Dominguez said at Thursday's news conference. Amaya is not the first person arrested in connection with the October shootings. Lynwood, Illinois, police officer Brian Dorian was charged with first-degree murder, but four days later was released from jail after authorities were able to verify his alibi. ""I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this,"" said Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow. ""At no time did we stop looking for exculpatory evidence.""",1,6.334478225871321
a8621a8cbdd1faa9f08e92ad083dfefaeeaa501d,CNN,"(CNN) -- More than 55,000 cases of dengue, a sometimes deadly mosquito-borne disease, have been reported in a southeastern Brazilian state in the past four months, authorities said Thursday. The disease has killed 67 people this year in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, the state's ministry of health reported. Slightly less than half of the deaths were children under the age of 13, the ministry said. Brazilian authorities are calling the situation an epidemic. The ministry of health did not identify whether the deaths were attributed to the more severe form of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever, which ""can be fatal if unrecognized and not properly treated,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC said that with treatment, fatalities due to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by abnormal internal or external bleeding, can be less than 1 percent. Dengue fever, the more common form of dengue, is caused by four closely related viruses. All of them are carried by infected mosquitoes, mainly the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the CDC said.  Watch a report on the outbreak » . It cannot be spread from person to person. The Rio de Janeiro health ministry said 513 of its 57,010 cases of dengue were that of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Cesar Maia said that patients from outside the city are flooding the municipal hospital and that there aren't enough beds to accommodate them, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported. The newspaper said the average hospital waits ranged from eight to 28 hours in some places. One father told O Globo, ""I am just watching my son die slowly as we knock on different hospital doors."" The state's secretary of health, Sergio Luiz Cortes da Silveira, acknowledged, ""We don't have enough hospitals for these patients."" He said the state was appealing for help from pediatricians elsewhere in the country.  Watch ill Brazilians being cared for » . Earlier this week, the country's health minister, Jose Gomes Temporao, said that 2,000 people, including members of the Ministry of Health and the military, were working to combat the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the government reported on its Web site. At least part of this work, he said, included going door-to-door to inform people of where the mosquitos live. ""Without the mosquito, dengue does not exist,"" he said, according to the government. The CDC estimates that there are 10 million cases of dengue around the world each year. ""It actually is quite common,"" said Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC.  Watch Khan discuss dengue and its prevention » . Mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in stored, exposed water, including places as shallow as jars, discarded bottles and plant saucers, according to the World Health Organization. Khan emphasized prevention. ""Wear long sleeves, loose, baggy pants and make sure you're using good insect repellent.""

99a192d406419287aa455d6db25d2bc14e043274,CNN,"(CNN) -- The mother of passenger No. 63 aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is unable to come out of the shadows of her son's misdeed to mourn with the rest of the families whose loved ones disappeared on March 8. ""As a human being, as a mother, nobody thought of me. I am alone with no support except for God,"" she wrote after CNN tried to contact her about her son. She is suffering alone because she has shied away from the epicenter of information in Kuala Lumpur. She isn't there to attend the briefings, or to get the grief counseling provided by Malaysia Airlines. She is a mother whose son broke the law to get on the plane, and she is now paying for it. Her son is 18-year-old Pouria Nourmohammadi. He and his friend Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, were the two Iranian men who boarded the Malaysia Airlines flight using stolen passports, investigators say. They were two of the first people to come under suspicion in the plane's disappearance. Malaysia Airlines says it has not been in contact with the families. Their case is in the hands of investigators, a company representative told CNN. But investigators cleared them of any wrongdoing in connection with the disappearance of the plane early in the investigation. Nourmohammadi's mother is acutely aware that her son did something illegal, but she says he just wanted to explore his ""beautiful dreams."" ""I dedicated my life to my sons, and all I wanted was for them to be happy in their life. I wanted them to live a free life. I had prayed that I would see him again, but that didn't happen. We will see each other in eternity now."" Going on after sudden loss of a loved one . She pours out her grief with pictures of her son, messages to him and symbols of their Christian faith posted on her Facebook page. ""... From the moment I became a mother, all I wanted and asked from God was to not see my children die before me. But of course that didn't happen,"" she wrote. CNN met with a friend who dropped Nourmohammadi off at the airport on March 8 in Kuala Lumpur. The friend said that all Nourmohammadi wanted was to find ""freedom."" He boarded the plane with a plan to live in Germany with his mother and never return to Iran, his friend said. His friend did not want to be identified for fear that being associated with the men traveling on stolen passports would make him a target for harassment by authorities when he travels in and out of Iran. But he says Nourmohammadi's mother called him, looking for answers: . ""She was so sad. She was asking me, 'When my son was there, was he happy? He was enjoying?' ""And I said, 'Yeah, as I see. He was happy and he was enjoying. He was OK.' Then she just said, 'Thank God.' "" Interpol has rebutted Malaysia's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded Flight 370, an omission that may have allowed Nourmohammadi and Reza onto the plane. Malaysian Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told the Malay Mail Online last week that using Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters. He said the country's immigration equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports. Interpol fired back, saying the problem cannot be blamed on technology or the agency. ""Interpol's SLTD database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed, with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds,"" the international law enforcement agency said in a statement. ""The fact is that the U.S. consults this database more than 230 million times per year; the UK more than 140 million times; the UAE more than 100 million times and Singapore more than 29 million times. Not one of these countries, or indeed any INTERPOL member country, has ever stated that the response time is too slow."" Nourmohammadi's Facebook message four days before he got on the plane shows him standing below an iconic Malaysian skyscraper with the words, ""feeling excited."" He never made it to his final destination, just like the other passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. Nourmohammadi's mother left this message, hoping it would not fall on deaf ears just because her son broke the law: . ""Although he had a stolen passport,"" his mother said, ""he was so young with many beautiful dreams. I'm a mother just like the Chinese mothers, and I want to know what happened too. I trust in God and whatever he wants will happen. But all 239 persons are the same, maybe somebody doesn't believe that."" 6 missteps in the investigation . Read the cockpit transcript .

8d437dd2fcd1e0ba7912912f7adce1095418d11c,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A medical marijuana advocacy group sued the Obama administration Thursday, saying its policy ""to subvert local and state medical marijuana laws in California"" is unconstitutional. Americans for Safe Access accused the U.S. Justice Department of deploying aggressive SWAT-style raids, prosecuting medical marijuana patients and providers, and threatening local officials for implement state medical pot laws. The group, a nonprofit based in Oakland, California, that says it's the country's largest medical marijuana advocacy organization, cited U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag of the northern district of California in its federal lawsuit filed in San Francisco. ""Under the Tenth Amendment, the government may not commandeer the law-making function of the state or its subdivisions or indirectly through the selective enforcement of its drug laws,"" the lawsuit said. ""It is this misuse of the government's commerce clause powers, designed to deprive the state of its sovereign ability to chart a separate course, that forms the basis of the plaintiff's claim."" Earlier this month, federal prosecutors in California announced a series of actions targeting what they characterized as the ""large, for-profit marijuana industry"" that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago. Four U.S. attorneys -- Benjamin Wagner, Andre Birotte Jr., Laura Duffy and Melinda Haag -- detailed in a joint press release and later a press conference in Sacramento some steps that have been taken in conjunction with federal law enforcement and local officials in California. They include letters of warning to landlords and lien holders of places in which marijuana is being sold illegally, ""civil forfeiture lawsuits against properties involved in drug trafficking activity"" and numerous criminal cases. The latter refers to arrests in recent weeks related to cases filed in federal courts in Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno, all part of an effort that Wagner claimed has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of pounds of marijuana, tens of thousands of plants and hundreds of thousands in cash. Thursday's lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and was filed on behalf of its 20,000 members in California, the medical marijuana advocacy group said. ""This case is aimed at restoring California's sovereign and constitutional right to establish its own public health laws based on this country's federalist principles,"" the association's chief counsel, Joe Elford, said in a statement. In 1996, California voters approved Proposition 215 to exempt doctors and seriously ill patients from marijuana laws and allow them to grow and use it in treatment. The bill didn't legalize marijuana for all, but it did lead to the emergence of hundreds of dispensaries where people -- legally only those with medical conditions and a doctor's authorization -- could get the drug. In explaining the federal crackdown earlier this month, Wagner, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, said authorities ""are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people. We are targeting commercial operations, which profit from growing and distributing ... and often use the trappings of state law for cover, but in fact are abusing state law."" Haag, U.S. attorney for California's northern district, claimed that ""profiteers ... motivated not by compassion, but by money"" had ""hijacked"" the intent of voters to help those suffering from debilitating conditions. And Birotte, from California's central district, said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick, but to relatively healthy people. CNN's Rich Porter and Erica Henry contributed to this story.",1,10.425216667557532
9a6dc2585590403e20d7dc8e65231f11fa819273,CNN,"(CNN) -- Like a put-upon hotelier trying to fix a decrepit property while simultaneously dealing with demanding guests, the decline of print and rise in peer-reviewed websites like TripAdvisor have given travel guide publishers a big headache. ""It's easier for smaller publishers (to cope with changing times),"" says Stephen Mesquita, travel publishing analyst. ""They're much fleeter of foot; it's not like they're an ocean liner that has to be turned around."" According to Mesquita's Nielsen BookScan Travel Publishing Yearbook, sales of printed world travel guides have declined by over 40% in the last seven years. But building a successful brand in the travel guide business can still be achieved, although it can mean more than just providing a hit-list of must-sees. From a company that was based on ""dirty weekends"" in England, Mr & Mrs Smith hotel guides have been doing their best to make a clean break from what went before. Set up by British couple James Lohan and Tamara Heber-Percy ten years ago, the luxury guidebook has carved a niche in a crowded marketplace by appealing to a particular demographic. ""It all started after a crappy weekend in a hotel in the Lake District (in England) when I was trying to impress Tamara,"" says Lohan. ""We realized there weren't really any guide books that were talking to a 30-something audience."" As hotels upped their game to appeal to a more stylish clientele who could afford weekends away from the weekly grind, Lohan and Heber-Percy saw an opportunity. Remortgaging their house to produce and publish the first guide to these hip new hotels was the first challenge, but finding a receptive publisher and distributor was almost harder. ""The first book was nearly impossible, publishers didn't understand our idea and said another luxury guidebook wasn't needed,"" says Lohan. ""We thought naively that we could ring up Waterstones (bookshop) and turn up with the car boot open with boxes of books, saying, 'How many do you want?' ""But as soon as we got it out there, it was phenomenal. We've never really had to try too hard to get hotels on board since."" What they have had to do however is adapt to a rapidly changing travel environment, from the way people plan and book their holidays to what they want from a guide book. ""Many guides have reinvented their business models, becoming online booking services or increasingly doing business-to-business operations and looking to online advertising,"" says Mesquita. ""The brand these days is all important."" Now with a 24-hour travel booking service, Mr & Mrs Smith has morphed into something neither Lohan or Heber-Percy -- who have visited over 1,000 hotels over the last ten years -- could have envisioned when they began. ""We're now starting to learn a new part of the travel business. The thing it get most nervous about is note expanding into other areas, but that the integrity of the business is intact."" Personality and standing out from the crowd also helped the diminutive Luxe City Guides punch above their weight and gain a foothold in the international travel guide business. Founder Grant Thatcher champions his guides' snippy and snarky style and credits it with the guide's success. ""We're aiming at a very targeted, solvent but time poor readership, scorning the word comprehensive and going right for opinionated jugular,"" he says. Rather than the internet dilute the appeal of the guide or its money-making potential, Thatcher believes it has helped niche publications like his own. ""Inevitably, the online and digital markets have and are revolutionizing all aspects of how we travel, research and respond to travel trends. The travel guide market has become much more specialized, rather than trying to appeal to the widest audience,"" he says. Thatcher says that nearly 1.5 million Luxe City Guides have been sold since launch, while Lohan and Heber-Percy have no intention of doing away with their print editions, looking to China and Asia as the next places for their global expansion. Mesquita has also seen something of a rebound in the printed travel guide market, primarily he says as some players have simply stepped out of the game leaving a larger share for those who have weather the storm. ""Don't write print off just yet. Last year many players have disappeared from the market altogether and for some of those that have stayed they've even seen some gains in sales,"" he says.",6,9.044783346274219

4c1d23109868dc1f920f47995ec665984a21ba0f,CNN,"LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- Peru's Congress voted overwhelmingly to revoke two decrees that indigenous groups had said would result in the exploitation of their native lands for oil drilling, mining and logging. A man shouts slogans at a demonstration in Lima against the Garcia government on June 11. The 82-14 vote on Thursday with no abstentions came after five hours of intense debate. ""Today is a historic day,"" said Daysi Zapata, vice president of the Interethnic Association for Development of the Peruvian Jungle, in a statement on the group's Web site. She repeated the group's call this week to its members to abandon further opposition efforts, including blockades of rivers and roads. ""My brothers from Yurimaguas affirmed that they will return to their communities as soon as the legislative decrees are repealed,"" she said. ""We are thankful because the will of the indigenous people has been heard and we only hope that, in the future, government will pay attention to and listen to the people and not legislate behind their backs."" However, despite praising President Alan Garcia for supporting the revocation of the decrees, Zapata said that had he done so earlier, lives might have been saved. She called for the repealing of seven remaining legislative decrees and the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and curfew in the city of Bagua. And she asked the government to stop the political persecution of her group's leaders, including Alberto Pizango, who faces charges in Peru related to the clashes. He flew this week to Nicaragua where he was granted asylum. The vote came a day after Garcia's cabinet chief, Yehude Simon, called on lawmakers to repeal the laws which have created tension between the government and indigenous communities in the Amazon. Striking the contentious Forestry and Wildlife Law and a related decree -- laws that Congress had voted last week to suspend indefinitely -- ""will prevent more blood from being spilled,"" Simon said Wednesday. ""The government must have the wisdom to know when its best to back down,"" Andina cited him as saying. He announced this week that he will resign once peace is restored. Simon's call marked a turnaround, considering that last week, he called the repealing of laws in response to the protest the equivalent of bowing to extortion. Violence earlier this month in northwest Peru left more than 30 dead and more than 50 wounded, according to reports. Indian rights advocates put the number of dead and missing higher, with some groups saying more than 100 were killed or missing. The controversial laws were part of numerous decrees that Garcia passed through special powers awarded to him by Congress last year with the goal of having Peru meet rules set in a free trade agreement with the United States. The decrees made it easier for companies to gain concessions for oil drilling, mining and logging, including on indigenous lands. The forestry law, in particular, removed some 45 million hectares (more than 170,000 square miles) of Peruvian jungle from the government's list of protected lands. The government is taking three major steps to address protesters' concerns, Vicki Gass, senior associate for rights and development at the Washington Office on Latin America told CNN. Those include requesting to repeal the controversial laws, ending a state of emergency in the Amazon area and forming a working group with the indigenous groups, she said. The government's responses have diffused tensions, but ""had the government done this process of consultation earlier, we wouldn't have seen the blockades, and avoided the violence,"" Gass said. The real test for the Garcia government will be how seriously officials listen to the concerns of indigenous citizens, Gass said. ""These are positive steps, but the question is the process -- will they really allow for detailed debate?"" she said.

688c42abc935b07577f367137932e7a13f459c42,CNN,"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia has had its first death from swine flu, its Ministry of Health said Monday, bracing for more. The patient -- a 30-year-old man who lived in the country's Eastern Province -- was admitted to a hospital in the city of Dammam on Wednesday with a high fever, cough and shortness of breath. He died Saturday. Saudi Arabia has diagnosed more than 230 cases of the H1N1 virus this year. In the past few weeks, a debate about the virus has erupted in the Middle East. Of particular concern is how to keep it from spreading among the millions of visitors expected in Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj -- a pilgrimage required of Muslims at least once in their lives. On Wednesday, Arab health ministers held an emergency summit in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss the issue. Guidelines were issued, banning various groups from participating in this year's Hajj -- children under 12, adults over 65 and people with chronic diseases. Saudi Arabia recommended that pregnant women stay home as well. At the close of the meeting, Saudi Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah told CNN that, in all, Saudi Arabia had issued 15 recommendations to help ensure the safety and health of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. ""The most important of those is, first of all, that they should take the seasonal flu vaccine two weeks prior to Hajj,"" Al-Rabeeah said. Even with the guidelines in place, World Health Organization spokesman Dr. Ebrahim el Khordany acknowledged that it won't be easy keeping potential pilgrims away. El Khordany told CNN, ""It was discussed in detail how it's going to be worked out between the country and Saudi Arabia to find out the best way to do it and, of course, to make sure that people don't try to use their connections to get their visas or to get to go to Saudi, because people are really very keen to go to the pilgrimage."" The Saudi government has also said it will set up quarantine centers at airports as another preventative measure.",8,8.222774359758125
47cc0fd9370b2672698e7045dde89ab996dcab21,CNN,"(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors have offered teenager Kaitlyn Hunt a new plea deal -- one that would keep her out of jail, even if she'd have to admit wrongdoing -- tied to charges she's facing for having sex with a then-14-year-old girl, a state attorney said Wednesday. Hunt, who turned 19 on Wednesday according to her family, is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14-year-old went to authorities. Hunt's family says their relationship was consensual, though in Florida a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex. Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit, told CNN that his office offered Hunt the latest plea deal in July. Under its terms, she would plead to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody -- a charge that could be expunged later from her record -- said Colton. In exchange, Hunt would be subject to a curfew, would have to do community service and would be on probation, he added. But she would not face jail time, nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender. The state attorney says he feels the plea deal addresses the concerns of Hunt, the younger teenage girl and their respective families. Hunt's lawyer replied that her client wouldn't agree to such a deal, according to Colton. But the state attorney's office is pressing the lawyer further, asking for documentation that shows Hunt talked about the arrangement with her client and that Hunt formally declined it. As of Wednesday, that last part hadn't happened, Colton said. If Hunt is convicted on all charges she's currently facing, she could go to prison for 15 years. No trial date has been set. The current offer is at least the second plea deal offered by prosecutors. Last spring, Hunt rejected one that would have required her to plead no contest to child abuse and, in return, spend two years on strict ""community control"" followed by one year of probation. ""If this case involved a boy and girl, there would be no media attention to this case,"" her attorney Julia Graves said then in a statement. ""... If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when (Hunt) was 17, we wouldn't even be here."" The case generated buzz when Hunt's family went public on Facebook, detailing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay. The victim's family said that isn't true; they are only trying to protect their teenage daughter. Sheriff: Case is about age, not gay rights . Jim and Laurie Smith have told CNN affiliate WPEC that they twice warned Hunt, who was then 18, to stop. They took action after going to their daughter's bedroom one weekend morning and discovered she was missing. ""We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort,"" Jim Smith said. Hunt's supporters see the case differently, with some accusing the Smiths of going after the teen because of her sexual orientation. And for Hunt herself, she doesn't want to pay for a relationship that, in her opinion, was not wrong. ""I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life,"" she said earlier this year, ""not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family.""

0de7b614a2bb8a5b3b3710f3979b68f15ccd3329,CNN,"(CNN) -- The deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi underscores the gaping power vacuum across Libya since the toppling of Moammar Gadhafi's regime last year. Fighting groups that battled Gadhafi have stepped in to maintain law and order after the fall of the regime, an expert on post-Gadhafi Libya told CNN. Most of the groups are simply neighborhood watch entities. But some include hard-line Muslim Salafis and have ""a very Islamist orientation,"" said Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The group accused of being behind the consulate assault, the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, is said to be pro-al Qaeda. Ex-SEALs, online gaming maven among Benghazi dead . ""The problem is that the Libyan army and the Libya police forces effectively disintegrated,"" Wehrey said. ""These groups are basically running the show"" throughout much of Libya. Another analyst, Andrew Lebovich, a Washington-based researcher focused on security issues in North Africa and the Sahel, said the militias, criminal groups, and hard-line Islamist groups in Libya make up a ""somewhat diffuse"" environment. ""Some groups, such as the Ansar al-Sharia Brigades in Benghazi and Derna and the Imprisoned Omar Abdel Rahman Brigades have been involved in increasing shows of force and outright attacks against Western and other targets in Libya in recent months,"" he said. Wehrey, in speaking to CNN, cited two of his recent essays about security in Libya. One was in Foreign Affairs in July and the other appeared Wednesday on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace website. He said the fledgling government is in a bind. Officials are trying to demobilize and reintegrate the militias and bring these groups into the government security forces, he said. But the militia members across Libya remain loyal to their groups and distrust the new government's authority, in part because of the ""taint"" of a link to the Gadhafi regime, Wehrey said. The government has used militia commanders to quell tribal fighting, subcontracted border control and defense of oil installations to small brigades, and used armed groups to provide security during elections. In Benghazi, he said, ballots for an election were stored and counted at the headquarters of the city's strongest militia. Six things to know about the attack . ""The strategy of trying to dismantle the regional militias while simultaneously making use of them as hired guns might be sowing the seeds for the country's descent into warlordism,"" he warned. ""It has also given local brigades and their political patrons leverage over the central government. Emboldened by the writ of state authority, brigade commanders have been free to carry out vendettas against rival towns and tribes, particularly those favored by ... Gadhafi,"" Wehrey said. Violence between warring militias and attacks against Western and moderate Sufi Muslim targets erupted in recent months, Wehrey said. In Benghazi, there was a ""rapid deterioration"" of security before the U.S. Consulate attack. Pro-al Qaeda group seen behind deadly Benghazi attack . A strike on a British consulate vehicle in Benghazi in June wounded a diplomat. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its workers endured attacks at least five times in less than three month in Benghazi and Misrata. The group announced the suspension of its activities in August. The Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, in fact, first surfaced in May when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the ICRC office in Benghazi. The next month it claimed responsibility for detonating a blast outside the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. It also released a video of the attack. Sufi mosques and tombs were among the sites targeted. Sufism is considered a more moderate form of Islam. Libyan Interior Minister Fawzi Abdel A'al was quoted by Human Rights Watch as calling the attackers ""groups that have a strict Islamic ideology where they believe that graves and shrines must be desecrated."" That comment, Human Rights Watch said, refers to Salafists, the name for those Muslims who want a ""return to Islam as they believe it was practiced in the days of the Prophet Mohammed."" Salafists have increasingly asserted themselves in eastern Libya. In June, hundreds of fighters wielding AK-47s and black Islamist banners converged on Benghazi to call for the imposition of sharia law. This spring, an associate of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri addressed a large gathering in the town square of Derna, in eastern Libya. An online video of his address has been seen by CNN. ""Salafi militias have reportedly carried out assassinations of Gadhafi-era officials, taken over radio stations and shut down beauty parlors,"" Wehrey said. Derna has for years been a recruiting ground for al Qaeda. A 2008 diplomatic cable from Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was slain in the consulate attack, described the area as ""a wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters"" for al Qaeda in Iraq. In some cases, Wehrey said, the revolutionary brigades have become ""very sophisticated."" They have checkpoints, security headquarters, ID cards, and their own payroll. Some militia coalitions have made handshake deals to police areas. Yemen police, demonstrators hurt in U.S. Embassy . ""These are militias that operate openly,"" and operate blogs and Facebook pages. With that Salafi foothold in eastern Libya, Wehrey said, it wouldn't be hard for armed militia members to ""converge on a target"" in Benghazi with an hour's notice. Was al Qaeda involved? Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the al Qaeda branch that operates in Africa, would have connections in the country's far south, if it indeed has any network in Libya, Wehrey said. And Lebovich said he's seen no evidence of ""overt"" al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb involvement in Libyan violence, despite reports of arrests, smuggling and weapons purchases linked to the group. As for other militia groups, he said, ""There is little public evidence linking their actions to al Qaeda, even if some of these groups' leaders have extensive militant pasts and ties with the group."" ""However,"" he added, ""we know very little about the exact compositions of Libya's hard-line militias beyond the top public leadership, making it impossible to say definitively whether or not links or relationships with other jihadist organizations like al Qaeda, or members of these organizations, are playing a role in militia-led violence in Libya."" Regarding the consulate attack, Wehrey said he thinks the strike ""was a much more local affair"" than one that involved al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. He called it ""the latest in a series of attacks by the country's increasingly active Salafis."" ""Libyans' public reaction to such strong-arm tactics has been vociferous and damning,"" Wehrey said. ""Tribes, women's groups, and civil society -- as well as the country's increasingly active social media community -- have all mobilized to condemn the recent attacks on Sufis, while mounting demonstrations of their own against the Salafis' shows of force."" Wehrey said that ""much of the violence suggests a movement in search of a cause."" Salafis ""are now grasping at foreign causes they believe will excite Libyans' emotions,"" such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, and anti-Americanism, he said. Meanwhile, the country's provisional government has had to deputize revolutionary brigades for security work. ""Invariably, these poorly trained bodies contain a number of Salafi militias who have used their warrant from the government to enforce draconian social mores, conduct vendettas against Gadhafi-era intelligence officers, and attack Sufis,"" Wehrey said. Citizens have voiced outrage over Salafi shows of force and have mobilized against their ""strong-arm tactics against, for example, the Sufis."" ""For the citizens of Tripoli, Benghazi and other cities, all this is a stark and tragic reminder of the perennial problems of poor governance and the security vacuum,"" Wehrey said.

c76d71e969228ba0040c12fed986318ebc9aec61,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tempted as I am to write about Anthony Weiner's sexual compulsions, I think it is more important to talk about his wife, Huma Abedin. What the hell was she doing at Weiner's press conference Tuesday, where he once again asked her and the public for forgiveness for a new set of sexual transgressions, instead of being at her attorney's office? If this were a multiple-choice test for my students in my class on intimate relationships at the University of Washington, I might phrase the question like this: . Two years after the former congressman (and now New York City mayoral candidate) left his office in disgrace because he had ""sexted"" revealing pictures of his body to women, he was alleged to have once again taken on an anonymous identity, reportedly making sexual overtures and exchanging explicit pictures with a young woman. Why did Abedin stand by him and defend him in a press conference? A) She is insanely ambitious and wants to be the wife of a successful politician. B) She believes he has a problem and she is going to help him with it because that's what a woman does for her man. C) She believes in her marriage vows and can't stand the idea of breaking up her family. D) All of the above. D is probably the right answer. Congress and lewd photos: An Anthony Weiner timeline . It's one thing to stay with your guy when he has a big problem. It's another to support him going after public office only to find yourself dragged in front of the cameras again after he engages in the same compulsive sexual behavior that you forgave before. She could have said, ""OK, we'll fix this, but we need you in treatment, not in public office."" Obviously, leaving public office isn't in the cards, and that's significant. But A and C also ring true. Abedin's behaviors are squarely in the realm of women's high esteem for love, friendship and loyalty, and for tending and befriending the weak and the beleaguered, as described by UCLA psychologist and professor Shelley Taylor. This gives the impression of being a doormat, but the woman thinks of it as being stalwart and noble. Abedin may not be quite in this category -- but she seems dangerously close to it. Finally, there is the role of family. For some women ""till death do us part"" means just that. They believe in staying in a marriage no matter what, especially when a small child is involved. If the man is a good father -- and there is every indication Weiner is -- a wife will go to extremes to stay married . So why does Huma stay? We don't know, but it's surely complicated. Her steadfastness is hard to watch though. She doesn't deserve this, and he doesn't deserve her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.",4,11.495811340977523
ec962a53b664db6b5a7fed3a59e3a248fc04e28c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will include rugby union sevens, a shortened version of the 15-player game, and golf as sports, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced. The IOC announced Rio's successful bid for the 2016 Olympic Games last week. Two months ago the IOC's executive board voted to include the sports in the program, a proposal that was ratified by the body's members at a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Friday. Rugby sevens, a sport played with exactly the same rules as the regular version -- just with less players, garnered 81 votes in favor while eight were against and one abstained. Golf was voted in with 63 votes to 27, with two abstentions -- it means the number of ""Olympic"" sports has reached the IOC's stated maximum of 28. Blog: Money, money, money should be new Olympic motto. The vote was delayed as some IOC members cast doubt on the selection process that had seen the two sports put forward, but on announcing the result IOC president Jacques Rogge said: ""Time will show your decision was very wise."" The two disciplines will be part of the 2016 and 2020 Games as a result of the vote, a move that prompted IRB president Bernard Lapasset to tell reporters: ""This is an historic moment for our sport and for the global rugby community, who were united in their support."" Rugby's world governing body, the IRB, has promised to end its World Cup Sevens event in order to allow 12 men's and women's teams to take part in the competition. Similarly, the International Golf Federation (IGF) has said that of the 60 players who will compete in the men's and women's tournament over 72 holes, the world's top stars will all be present. The executive director of the IGF's Olympic Golf Committee, Ty Votaw,  was equally delighted. After coordinating the successful Olympic bid of his sport, he said: ""We are elated the IOC membership has accepted golf as an Olympic sport, and look forward to seeing the world's best golfers compete for gold at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro."" Softball, squash, baseball, karate and roller sports all bid to be accepted as Olympic sports but were turned down by the executive board two months ago. Golf previously featured at the Paris Games of 1900 and in St Louis in 1904, while Olympic medals could be won by rugby players who contested the 15-a-side format from 1900-24. Meanwhile, Rogge has been re-elected unopposed as president.

db34141640920e85ae47fb29c71111c638a2e95e,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""The people and the army are one hand,"" the chant of Egypt's January 25th revolution on the eve of President Hosni Mubarak's resignation, has yielded in the face of toxic gases, rubber bullets and live ammunition from the security forces, composed of army and police, to ""the army and the police are one dirty hand."" The trust and gratitude the Egyptian people once felt toward the military for their solidarity in ousting Mubarak has evaporated as the brutality of the army and police has caused scores of deaths and thousands of injuries. Not only tear gas and rubber bullets, but also toxic gases -- which cause seizures and reportedly led to several deaths by asphyxiation -- and live ammunition have been aimed at the protesters. Tweets from all over Egypt reveal the shock at this criminal behavior. One said, ""I am out of words. Egyptian army is murdering Egyptian civilians. That's our worst living nightmare."" The November revolution differs from the 18 days that led to Mubarak's downfall not only in the escalating violence, but also in the new coalitions that have emerged as well as the old alliances that have been exposed. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic opposition group, has fractured: Members of its youth have aligned themselves with the protesters, while the leadership has supported the position of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) that the parliamentary elections, which began today, must go forward. Banking on a good showing in the elections, the Muslim Brotherhood leadership stayed away from Tahrir Square for the first week of this month's protests. Islamist youths discovered their leadership's duplicity on the first day of the demonstrations, November 18, which was called as a day of protest by Islamists. The plan to have a contained demonstration backfired and led to the current nationwide uprising. Nawara Negm, a female journalist, activist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, said in an interview posted on YouTube that they were urged to leave Tahrir Square on the first night of the protests, when a few hundred youth activists moved in to reclaim the square. ""The Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi leaders insisted we go home after the Friday protests .... I decided to stay with my brothers and sisters here in the sit-in in Tahrir Friday night until our voices are heard. Then the brutal, deadly attacks on us started. I cannot help but think now that those Islamists' leaders had some sort of a deal with SCAF, but thank God it did not work out."" After days of equivocating on the violence, the U.S. first called on the military to halt its attacks on the protesters, and then, in a dramatic change of position, withdrew its support for the SCAF. The White House statement, issued early Friday morning, called for ""full transfer of power to a civilian government"" in a ""just and inclusive manner."" It was greeted with incredulity in Tahrir. As in the January revolution, the U.S. government has been perceived as supporting its allies -- the SCAF as much as Mubarak -- over the democratic aspirations of the people. That the tear gas canisters still bear the moniker ""Made in the USA,"" as they did in January, does not help. In its support for proceeding with the parliamentary elections, the U.S. finds itself in an odd allegiance with the SCAF and the Muslim Brotherhood and out of touch with the sentiment on the street. Tahrir Square never has been about ""free and fair elections first,"" although the people have that expectation. The revolution of people carrying signs asking for ""dignity,"" ""freedom,"" ""equality"" and ""social justice"" always encompassed much more than political processes. The people dying on Egypt's streets are fighting for the true conditions of a just society. Elections, which in Egypt always can be manipulated, cannot be trusted to deliver that goal. Far from promoting democracy, holding the parliamentary elections on time ignores the will of the people -- not to mention the sacrifices of those who have been killed or wounded -- and plays into the hands of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Many factors taint the elections: . -- Holding the elections amounts to a forced approval of SCAF's brutal repressive practices, with the violence still ongoing throughout Egypt, out of the sight of the cameras in Tahrir Square. -- Exerting total control over the media, SCAF manipulates public opinion with unchecked lies about protesters (think of the three American college students who were detained) and bullies independent networks, such as ONTV, with defamation campaigns, often targeting individual reporters, such as Yousri Foda. -- After refusing for months to allow international monitors to observe the elections, SCAF relented at the last moment. But irregularities such as removing the ballot boxes to remote locations remain troubling. A full post-election evaluation will reveal the monitors' assessment of the transparency and honesty of the elections. -- Governance is in chaos. The country, in effect, has three governments, not to mention SCAF: the new prime minister, Kamal Ganzouri, appointed by SCAF and still forming a Cabinet; the interim prime minister, Essam Sharaf, supposedly still in position; and a Tahrir-formed Civil Council, led by the former diplomat and Nobel Prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei, former Muslim Brotherhood leader Aboul Fotouh and others. The November protests have shaken Egypt out of a period of post-revolution stagnation, with serious implications for the future. With the exception of those who have joined the protests, the military, from the generals at the top to the soldier on the street, has violated the trust of the people. Now they are seen in the same light as Mubarak. Many Muslim Brotherhood youths have broken off and have joined forces with the broad coalition of protesters. Al Azhar, Egypt's leading religious institution, has weighed in with the people against SCAF. And the ""leaderless revolution"" now has political backing. A coalition of many leaders from the principal parties, called by ElBaradei, has formally asked SCAF to leave. Also, representatives of the principal revolutionary movements have come together to support ElBaradei as prime minister over the SCAF's choice of Ganzouri. The Egyptian people, who at times since January have seemed apathetic about the future of the revolution, have shown their determination to reclaim it. The protesters all determined to stay in Tahrir, and on the streets and squares of Egypt, until SCAF steps down, hands power to a civil body, and submits to a public independent investigation into the violence and killings in January and February, the October Maspero protests (when the police attacked peaceful Christian Copts) and the strife in November.

878e7281e2543ec91ae7939360143abd14178d1f,CNN,"(CNN) -- After being humbled by Manchester City in the FA Cup and drawing against West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League, Chelsea could hardly afford to drop points against Everton on Saturday. The Blues didn't -- barely. And it was the man who has been dubbed 'Mr. Chelsea,' the returning John Terry, who struck deep in injury time following a free kick from another Chelsea veteran, Frank Lampard. Both were re-introduced to the starting lineup by manager Jose Mourinho against a stubborn Everton side chasing a European spot and the 1-0 victory temporarily increased Chelsea's lead atop the table to four points over Arsenal. The Gunners, however, once again cut the deficit to one point by later easing past Sunderland 4-1 and Man City stayed within three points of Chelsea -- with a game in hand -- courtesy of a 1-0 win over Stoke City. Vintage Chelsea it wasn't, but the result was all that mattered to Chelsea skipper Terry. ""We made it difficult but they are a very good side and are playing well under (Everton manager Roberto) Martinez,"" Terry, sidelined the previous three games with a muscle injury, told BT Sport. ""It was a tough game today. We're delighted with the win and three points."" Martinez wasn't delighted, though. He felt the free kick -- given when Chelsea midfielder Ramires went down -- shouldn't have been given by referee Lee Probert. ""It was one of those situations where players were trying to buy too many free kicks,"" Martinez told BT Sport. ""You need a strong referee. The second half is a very, very tough game for referee. ""You can see they are trying to get a dead ball situation because they couldn't get any joy from open play. You can see the reaction and way he loses his footing, it's not because of contact. He is looking for the free kick."" For more than 90 minutes, Everton indeed kept Chelsea at bay. Everton had the better of play in the first half, with Petr Cech saving from Leon Osman and Kevin Mirallas scuffing his shot when in a good position at the edge of the box. Chelsea could only go one way -- up -- and keeper Tim Howard foiled Lampard, Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic before Terry's winner. ""Great ball from Lamps,"" said Terry. ""I just managed to get a touch on it and I think it came off Howard in the end as well."" Arsenal, City respond . Arsenal and Manchester City, coming off demoralizing 2-0 home defeats to Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the Champions League, respectively, earned three points in contrasting fashion. Olivier Giroud, benched against Bayern Munich in favor of the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo, started and scored twice for Arsenal. Arsene Wenger, though, left record signing Mesut Ozil out of the squad after he missed a penalty against Bayern and was criticized on the pitch by teammate Mathieu Flamini on Wednesday for not doing enough defensively. City toiled against Stoke City at home, getting the lone goal from midfielder Yaya Toure in the 70th minute. ""Teams come here to defend and try to get a draw,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the club website. ""We cannot win by three or four goals every match."" Next up for City is Sunderland in the League Cup final on March 2. West Ham further eased its relegation worries by beating Southampton 3-1 for a fourth straight victory, Hull added to Cardiff's woes by thrashing the Welsh side 4-0 in Wales and Felix Magath earned a point in his managerial debut for last-place Fulham, with the Cottagers tying West Brom 1-1. Wayne Rooney, who signed a lucrative contract extension with Manchester United on Friday, celebrated with a goal in United's 2-0 win at Crystal Palace. ""He's a really important player,"" United manager David Moyes told Sky Sports. ""You think about the amount of clubs who wanted to sign him.

027b5e1c2573b44e61521e094e4ae2008dfe2dff,CNN,"(CNN) -- It was a mother's worst nightmare. On March 31, 2014, at 11 p.m., I received a phone call from my 25-year-old son. ""Mom. I got lost, made a wrong turn and ended up at the Mexico border. I've been surrounded by military, and I need you to know in case anything happens to me."" On April 1, I received another phone call. ""Mom, I've been arrested. Please get me an attorney,"" Andrew said. It was the most frightening call of my life -- worse than the call from Afghanistan as my son explained, ""We have just been hit by an IED."" The call from La Mesa Prison in Tijuana, Mexico, three days later went this way: ""Mom, I am not going to make it through the night. Whatever you do, do not come down here and ask questions or do an investigation as you will be killed as well."" As Independence Day comes and goes this year, it is bittersweet to think about my son being bound by a felony arrest in a foreign country while we try to navigate a foreign judicial system. To think about my son, vibrant and ambitious, being held in the bondage of incarceration is inconceivable. This young man who valiantly fought for the freedom of others, willing to die to combat the evil of oppression and violence in two tours in Afghanistan, meritoriously promoted to sergeant on the battlefield in 2012 -- and now he is languishing in a Mexican penitentiary and experiencing captivity for the first time, as a result of one wrong turn. It is simply staggering. He has been incarcerated since April 1, for inadvertently crossing the border with legally purchased firearms. This separation is by far more traumatic than the combat tours. Marine 'optimistic' he'll soon be released . In Afghanistan, he had his Marine Corps brothers who always had his back. I feel like our executive branch has abandoned him, and it feels totally inhumane. The White House has not responded to us despite our petition on Whitehouse.gov, which has nearly 130,000 signatures. The White House says it will respond to petitions that get 100,000 signatures in 30 days. On a trip to Mexico in May, Secretary of State John Kerry ""raised the issue"" with authorities there. I am outraged. Andrew's situation should be considered a grave, serious and urgent concern. In the past years while reading scripture, I often paused at the directive to visit those in prison. Deep in my core was the question, mingled with fear: How, who, why? Today I have learned to walk without shame, boldly and compassionately, through the corridors of bars and locks and have a newfound perspective for those imprisoned. Incarceration of a loved one is a heart-wrenching, soul-searching experience that can debilitate, consume and potentially destroy both the captive and his free loved ones. Marine tells of abuse in Mexican prison . It is a difficult journey, but there is rest to be found in understanding that God's timing is perfect. I take huge comfort in that, and this is what keeps me going and fortifies my strength and helps me to persevere when I can't see God's plan. The saying, ""Trust his heart when you can't trace his hand"" is something I really have had to implement. Through faith, I will continue choosing not to be crippled by the weight of the dismay, trauma, and disbelief associated with this, and I will be steadfast in my determination to overcome the barriers of this injustice. My strength, focus and vision come both from the Lord and from the solidarity and outreach of so many good folks on both sides of the border and around the world. I am not journeying alone as I have poured out my broken heart to so many. And it feels as if they symbolically cupped my tears and replenish me continuously with flowing waters of hope and support. I fear that my son's plight is getting lost in current events happening on the ground in Mexico, but I know that through the collective strength of prayer and the unified focus of individual Americans standing together as advocates, there will be victory for Andrew.",4,13.628093370558439
682d59a76f448d979816a1da57541485578df22a,CNN,"(CNN) -- Please bear with me as I ask you to briefly use your imagination. Close your eyes. Imagine Machu Picchu at dawn cloaked in fog. Now imagine the fog slowly lifting to reveal an enormous ancient city perched on the edge of a mountain. Picture a sense of mystery being immersed in thousands of years of history as you walk between antiquated hewn stone structures. There is tranquility in the wind-blown stillness of the primeval site. You feel a renewed sense of kinship with the past and with your ancestors and feel a deep reverence for their lives and accomplishments. Now imagine the menacing sound of bulldozers closing in and men at work. Their heavy machinery rattles the ground. You hear workers rigging dynamite to these massive stone structures. There is a brief lull and then the deafening blow of multiple explosions as Machu Picchu is razed to the ground. Be at ease, Machu Piccu is a UNESCO protected site. But a very similar 2,600-year-old Buddhist site in Logar province, Afghanistan isn't so lucky. This site is called Mes Aynak and is nothing short of awe-inspiring: a massive walled-in Buddhist city featuring massive temples, monasteries, and thousands of Buddhist statues that managed to survive looters and the Taliban. Holding a key position on the Silk Road, Mes Aynak was also an international hub for traders and pilgrims from all over Asia. Hundreds of fragile manuscripts detailing daily life at the site are still yet to be excavated. Beneath the Buddhist dwellings is an even older yet-unearthed Bronze age site indicated by several recent archaeological findings. Mes Aynak is set for destruction at the end of December 2012. All of the temples, monasteries, statues as well as the Bronze age material will all be destroyed by a Chinese government-owned company called China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC). Six villages and the mountain range will also be destroyed to create a massive open-pit style copper mine. In 2007, MCC outbid competitors with a $3 billion bid to lease the area for 30 years. MCC plans to extract over $100 billion worth of copper located directly beneath the Buddhist site. Ironically, the Buddhists were also mining for copper albeit in a more primitive fashion. MCC says they weren't told about the archaeology site's existence until after the contract was signed. Following significant international pressure and perhaps sensing an impending PR nightmare, MCC in 2009 gave archaeologists three years to attempt to excavate the site. Archaeologists say they need at least 30 years to do the job but had no choice but to accept MCCs brief timetable. Specialists on site are working with extremely limited funding and the crudest of tools. Afghan archaeologists, who do the majority of the excavation, don't have access to computers or digital cameras and have been sleeping on the floor in a wooden shack when staying on the site overnight. Today, three teams of international archaeologists led by DAFA, a French archaeological delegation, scramble to save as many relics as they can. These experts are performing rushed rescue archeology, which focuses on removing movable objects and not on preserving structures. Archaeologists now have less than four months to do three decades worth of excavation. They are also risking their lives daily as locals of Logar Province, angry at the loss of their villages partner with the Taliban to regularly attack both the MCC site and the archaeology location with rockets and land mines. In July, a Logar worker unearthed a landmine that exploded in his face. Later that month, four Afghan policemen were killed by a landmine on the road leading to the archaeology site. I am often asked, ""Why save it? It is, after all, just another remnant of the past, right?"" Wrong. Mes Aynak is the missing link that shows Afghanistan's interconnectivity throughout Asia on the Silk Road. Afghanistan needs to see the value of learning its own cultural history as too often the country's story is co-opted by the lens of another. Afghans need to claim their cultural significance in the world for current and new generations. And the findings at Mes Aynak will be the key to doing that. In addition to Mes Aynak's historical significance, the site is breathtaking to behold in person. I can't help but feel privileged and honored to have been able to set foot inside its ancient walls, to have been able to bare witness to massive Buddhas, many of which are still coated in gold paint overlooking their ancient city. These statues have miraculously survived looting, survived the intense heat and cold, and survived over three decades of continuous war. There is a magic to Mes Aynak -- an ability to draw in people from around the world who will risk their lives to save it. I fell in love with this ancient site and will do everything in my power to try to help save it. It sickens me to know that in a short time this site will be destroyed in the same violent and disrespectful way the Buddha of Bamyan was destroyed. This desecration shows no reverence to culture or religion. Imagine someone bulldozing your grandparents' graves and blowing up their cemetery. How could the world look away letting such crime happen in the name of capitalism? Unfortunately, Mes Aynak has gained some powerful enemies. MCC, The World Bank and Afghan ministries all want mining to start ASAP. In my opinion, they want Mes Aynak to set a precedent -- to be a model for resource extraction of the one trillion dollars plus of valuable minerals like oil, copper, lithium and iron buried underneath Afghanistan. According to archaeologists that I spoke with, every mining location holds cultural heritage. On every potential mine lies an ancient site like Mes Aynak. So, even worse than the senseless destruction of Mes Aynak, is the thought that this kind of cheap destructive process will be replicated all across Afghanistan. I often hear talk about mineral extraction being somehow good for Afghanistan, but I promise you this is not the case. Given the country's out of control corruption there are a privileged few who will see any payout from such endeavors. Afghan citizens have absolutely nothing to gain from this copper mine or any other international extractive industry. I believe Chinese will bring in their own laborers to manage the mine and Afghans will be given only low level and terribly paid positions working in slave-like conditions. And I have said nothing about the environmental devastation. Many mining experts have told me the toxic pollution from the mine will likely turn Mes Aynak into a site so toxic that in the future people will be advised against even setting foot on the ground. They tell me this pollution will be permanent, rivers will be polluted and the toxins will travel to other areas -- and the locals have never been educated about these risks to the area. So not only will Afghanistan lose an ancient site, a key to unlocking its important history, but the country will lose the land and everything living on it. And what happens when Afghanistan needs copper or oil or iron for its own development? Will they have to buy it back from China at inflated rates? My fear is that in the future Afghanistan will consist of hundreds of these gaping toxic craters and the resources the country needs for its own development will be lost. Afghans will see no benefit. They will suffer from irreversible environmental devastation and the permanent loss of invaluable cultural heritage. So as a final request I want you to close your eyes once again. Imagine a city-sized toxic crater in the ground where the majestic Machu Picchu once stood. That sight, unfortunately, is the future of Mes Aynak unless we do something to stop it.",2,11.268522311804656
b0e526324c059a109fa66575f9dd42cb91d7c02a,CNN,"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- Residents of Midland City, Alabama, gathered to show support and offer prayers for the family of a 5-year-old hostage held in a bunker. Saturday marked the fifth day of an armed standoff in that town, where authorities are negotiating through a ventilation pipe with the man accused of barricading himself and the boy underground. Police have been tight-lipped about a possible motive since the hostage drama began unfolding with the shooting of school bus driver and the abduction of the 5-year-old. In a sign of perhaps how tense negotiations are between authorities and the suspect, officials have refused to detail what, if any, demands have been made by the suspect. Michelle Riley, a resident of Midland City, pleaded for the suspect to let the boy go. ""He just needs to know that ... everybody makes mistakes. Everybody's been through life events that changes them, but (the boy's) innocent. You know, let him go home to his mother. Let him go home to his grandparents. Let him come out to the community. Let him go back to school and be with his friends,"" she said. She spoke at a Saturday vigil for the boy held outside the Midland City town hall. Residents there sang ""Amazing Grace."" ""I'm here in support of this family,"" said Deborah Trammell, also at the vigil. She explained that she lost a son five years ago in a car accident. ""I can relate to this family because they've had a child all of a sudden plucked out of their lives,"" she said. On Friday, the Dale County sheriff confirmed what neighbors have been saying and local news outlets have been reporting since the standoff began -- the suspected gunman's identity. 'We don't want to make any mistakes,' Ala. governor says . He is Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, a Vietnam veteran and retired truck driver who moved to the area about five years ago. The sheriff's department released a photo of a gray-bearded, unsmiling Dykes and brief physical description: white male, 6 feet tall, weighing 170 pounds with brown eyes and gray hair. Officials have been in ""constant communication"" with Dykes, Sheriff Wally Olson said Saturday. Dykes has told police that he has an electric heater and blankets for the boy. The sheriff publicly thanked Dykes for taking care of the child. This much is known, according to police and witness statements: On Tuesday at about 3:40 p.m., bus driver Charles Poland Jr. was shuttling children from school to their homes when he dropped children off and the gunman boarded the bus. The gunman demanded that Poland, 66, hand over two children. Poland refused, blocking access to the bus's narrow aisle as at least 21 children escaped out of the back emergency door, according to police. The gunman shot Poland four times, killing him; grabbed the boy and then barricaded the two of them inside a nearby bunker. It's unclear whether the gunman was after a specific child on the bus. Police have said there is no connection between the suspect and the abducted boy, whose identity is being withheld. The suspect, who police have identified as Dykes, is holed up in a bunker 4 feet underground and built at least partially out of PVC pipe, authorities have said. A hostage negotiator has been communicating with the alleged gunman through a 60-foot-long plastic ventilation pipe in an effort to end the standoff. Authorities believe the boy is physically unharmed. The suspect agreed to let police send down coloring books, crayons and prescription medication that the boy needs for treatment for Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit disorder, State Rep. Steve Clouse told CNN. Neighbors have said the bunker has electricity, and Dykes has been known to stay in it for up to eight days, said James Arrington, the police chief in nearby Pinckard. Dykes has been described as a self-styled survivalist with ""anti-government"" views, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch. The incident called to mind another bus hijacking. In 1976, three masked men boarded a school bus in Chowchilla, California, taking 26 children and their driver hostage. They were forced into a buried vehicle, where they spent 16 terrifying hours before they were able to escape. Jennifer Hyde was on that bus. She was 9 years old, and described what happened as the end of her childhood. ""You couldn't just go on and have a normal childhood when you faced a life threatening situation like that. You just can't go on and be carefree,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. She said her heart goes out to the boyet: ""I can't imagine him being alone in the situation that he's in. At least I was able to have other children with me and one adult that I knew and could trust."" As negotiations in Alabama continue, preparations were under way for Poland's funeral. Services for the late school bus driver will be held Sunday at the Ozark Civic Center. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley praised Poland for protecting the children on his bus. ""He stood in that place, and when that man came to take two children, he said no. And he lost his life because of that ... he did his job, and I'm proud of him as the governor but I'm just proud of him as a human being,"" he said.

fc30022e5e6380aaa8edec6493a24a477aa34fb1,CNN,"(CNN) -- The grim toll from a typhoon that devastated southern Philippines earlier this month continues to climb, with 1,020 reported dead as of Sunday morning, authorities said. Officials fear the toll from the December 4 storm will rise further. Because while rescue crews continue searching, the chances of finding people alive dim with each passing day. With 844 still missing and 1.2 million families displaced, Bopha is the strongest and deadliest storm to hit the Philippines this year, according to the country's emergency management agency. Among the missing are hundreds of fishermen who went to sea before the storm hit. Officials hope that they could yet be found sheltering on small islands out at sea. If the death toll continues to rise, Bopha could eventually prove deadlier than Tropical Storm Washi, which killed 1,268 people a year ago. But its toll would still remain far below that of Tropical Storm Thelma, the country's most lethal storm on record that left more than 5,000 people dead in 1991. The worst of the death and destruction from Bopha took place on the southern island of Mindanao, where the storm hit first and hardest with gusts as strong as 220 kph (138 mph). The storm, known locally as Pablo, was the most powerful typhoon to hit Mindanao in decades. It set off flash floods and landslides that engulfed people sheltering in their rickety houses in remote, unprepared regions of the island.",2,8.351708070893206
6c9515debefa13233ba5b80738be2d930f35ce71,CNN,"(CNN) -- Legend has it that when the surrealist painter Salvador Dali had to pay for an expensive restaurant meal he would twizzle his famous mustache and arch his eyebrows before beguiling his host into letting him dine for free. The crafty Catalan, it is said, would write out a check for the required amount and sign on the dotted line. Just before handing the payment over, however, he would pull the piece of paper back and pen an elaborate doodle on the opposite side. ""An original from the master Dali. I will never cash this check,"" would inevitably be the reply from the starstruck restaurant owner thrilled to be gifted an artwork that would doubtless be of greater value than the amount on the check itself. By perfecting the magic checkbook technique, Dali would rarely, if ever, have to pay for his dining habits. People might not hoard the recently revealed 100 Norwegian Krone ($15) banknote in the same manner -- but it too is a work of art in its own right. On one side, a giant viking boat makes progress upon a tranquil sea, sails blowing in full glory. On the other, an abstract interpretation of a pixelated ocean ebbs and flows like a game of watery Tetris. Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, held a competition to design the front and back of the new note, which will come into circulation in 2017. The winning designs, announced earlier in October, were submitted by Norwegian graphic designers The Metric System -- Terje Tonnessen and Snohetto. According to Norges Bank, the winning designs display ""artistic flair"" that emphasize Norway's close relationship with the sea, but are also ""suited to the incorporation of necessary security elements."" These will include machine-readable elements and anti-counterfeiting measures. Such high-tech accoutrements are now a common feature of the most modern banknotes. But art, the aesthetic and items of cultural significance are also a major consideration when designing the latest money. According to the curator of the British Museum's Modern Money Collection, Thomas Hockenhull, the art by itself isn't a particularly reliable security feature given the ""advancement of scanning and printing technology."" ""Those are maintained primarily to preserve public confidence in the note,"" Hockenhull said. But, he added, when combined with complex measures like watermarks, moving color elements and the latest in polymer and paper technology, a detailed image can make forgery more difficult. The Bank of Canada has produced bills in recent years that illustrate this elaborate synergy. Holographic and transparent features accompany state-of-the-art calligraphy that officials claim is nearly impossible to duplicate. Instead of using paper, the newest Canadian notes are made from a polypropylene substrate and feature a large transparent window through which you can see a metallic portrait above a metallic building. Beneath the portrait the word ""Canada"" is also transparent and is slightly raised. Other security features include a smaller frosted window with a maple leaf design, which has a transparent outline and contains hidden numbers only visible when lit up with a small light. Similar plastic and transparent elements can be found on the latest colorful currency from the likes of Guatemala, Australia and Nicaragua, Chile and Malaysia. The United States and United Kingdom, meanwhile, are at the forefront of the most complex paper currencies out there, Hockenhull said. The new British £50 note includes raised ink, contains a metallic thread embedded in the paper, and has a number ""50"" that appears in red and green under ultraviolet light. Among other features, the newest U.S. $100 bill has a 3-D blue ribbon woven into the paper, next to Benjamin Franklin's face. When the note is tilted, images of bells and the number 100 move from side to side, and up and down. The bill also has raised print, a color-changing number 100 in its bottom right corner, and microprinted text on Franklin's collar -- all carefully incorporated to make forgery more difficult. But complex though these designs may be, to our knowledge, a method to counter Dali's magic checkbook has yet to be devised.

dad01f9e8826c0166082f93b38049e105de73afe,CNN,"Atlanta (CNN) -- Police have found the body of a 7-year-old Georgia girl who went missing more than two days ago, the state's chief law enforcement official said Monday. Police believe Jorelys Rivera was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered at her apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Director Vernon Keenan. ""This is going to be a very, very horrendous crime. I am convinced of that after having observed the body. A child death is always a terrible thing, but a child who dies under extreme violence is the absolute worst thing,"" he told reporters. An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death, Keenan said. The girl was last seen Friday near a playground at her apartment. Police initially thought she might have wandered off, but after more than 48 hours of searching, they said they believed the girl was kidnapped. Canton police, assisted by the FBI and the GBI, expanded the search area Monday and began canvassing for sex offenders living nearby. They are now asking for help to find out who killed the little girl. Her body was found in a dumpster at the apartment complex where she lived. ""We need help from the public,"" said Police Chief Jeff Lance. As of Monday afternoon, Keenan said, investigators were actively pursuing leads, but police had no one in custody and no suspects. ""Quite frankly, at this point we do not have a strong suspect. We've not focused in on anyone. We very much need information from the public who may know something about the abduction of this child,"" said Keenan. State troopers were stopping and talking to everyone entering, leaving or driving by the apartment complex Monday afternoon. Earlier, as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child, her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children, who were taken by the Department of Family and Children's Services for alleged lack of supervision. The girl's parents are not suspects, Keenan said. Joselin Rivera had spoken with local media hours after her young daughter went missing Friday, saying she just wanted her returned safely. After the girl's body was found, neighbors said they feared for their safety. Speaking in Spanish, Luis Fernando Montenegro said he was concerned for his daughter, who attends night school. ""If she (Rivera) was abducted here and her body was also found here in the (apartment) complex, how do we know the killer is not still here?"" he asked.

231feb692f885ff38b85d4534951a7451930ca54,CNN,"(CNN) -- North Korea reacted with indignation to a United Nations decision to investigate allegations of human rights abuses inside the isolated state, claiming it has one of the best systems worldwide for protecting citizens' rights. The United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva said delegates agreed Thursday to set up a commission of inquiry to examine what it called ""grave, widespread and systematic"" violations of human rights in North Korea. The decision followed a recent report submitted to the council by an independent expert alleging North Korea had committed a range of abuses, including torture, enslavement, enforced disappearances and murder. Many of the alleged acts ""may amount to crimes against humanity,"" according to the report's author, Marzuki Darusman, an Indonesian lawyer. The council's decision to take action on his report comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North's latest underground nuclear test last month that prompted tougher U.N. sanctions on the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has ramped up its rhetoric, issuing threats to Washington and Seoul on a near daily basis. Annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces this month have fueled the North's ire. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean representative at the U.N. Human Rights Council, So Se Pyong, had strong words Thursday about the move to establish the commission of inquiry. North Korean video shows imagined attack on Washington . The draft resolution on the matter, adopted by the council without a vote, ""is no more than an instrument that serves the political purposes of the hostile forces in their attempt to discredit the image of the DPRK,"" So said, using the shortened form of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He warned of ""serious consequences"" if the council went ahead with the inquiry. North Korean citizens are ""happy with pride and honor that they have one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world,"" So told the council, according to the U.N. Reports of suffering . His assertions run counter to the accounts of many North Koreans who have fled the country telling of horrific conditions. Humanitarian workers and others who have visited the reclusive state have also described a suffering population. Officials from other countries at the U.N. council disagreed with the North's version of reality. ""For too long, the population of the country has been subjected to widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses,"" said Gerard Corr, the Irish representative speaking on behalf of the European Union. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps in North Korea that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. In his report to the U.N. council, Darusman identified nine patterns of rights violations in North Korea, such as depriving people of food, arbitrary detentions and heavy restrictions on freedom of expression. Under the issue of enforced disappearances, he also included the abductions of foreign citizens. A leading human rights group called the decision to set up the commission ""a landmark step."" ""This long awaited inquiry will help expose decades of abuse by the North Korean government,"" said Julie de Rivero, advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. ""The establishment of this commission sends a strong message to Pyongyang that the world is watching and its abuses must end,"" she said.

Valdez-Villarreal, who remains at large, is alleged to be a top member of the Arturo Beltran-Leyva cocaine cartel. Authorities have issued a $2 million reward for information leading to his capture. He is currently believed to be in Mexico, a Justice Department statement noted. ""This indictment shows that we are not content simply to arrest and prosecute those in our district who work on behalf of the Mexican cartels to bring cocaine into the United States,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said. ""We are committed to tracing the drugs back to the cartel leaders themselves, and we look forward to the opportunity to prosecute the sources of this cocaine in federal court."" The indictment charges Valdez-Villarreal, 36, Carlos Montemayor, 37, Juan Montemayor, 45, Ruben Hernandez, 38, and Roberto Lopez, 31, with conspiring to import and distribute cocaine, as well as attempted money laundering. The sixth defendant, Jesus Ramos, has already been arrested and arraigned in Atlanta, Georgia. Evidence unveiled during an early 2008 trial in Atlanta showed that Valdez-Villarreal played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, the statement indicated. Several tractor trailer trucks were used to ship the cocaine to Atlanta, as well as to transport millions of dollars in cash back to Mexico. Valdez-Villarreal, according to the U.S. State Department, was a member of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel until Arturo Beltran-Leyva broke off to form his own ring in 2008. Beltran-Leyva was killed in a shoot-out with Mexican officials in December 2009.",1,7.020033166452942

Tabbed as a ""mellow rocker"" by perhaps one too many publications, the chart-topping singer-songwriter has a fire within that belies his laid-back manner -- a fire that extends to his company, Brushfire Records, and his environmental activism. Johnson started the record label in 2002 ""as a way to put out soundtracks for surf movies we were making,"" he says. ""Then our friends G. Love and Special Sauce were coming to the end of their record deal with another label, and the idea came up to put out their stuff.""

The label's roster now includes indie-rockers Rogue Wave, folk-pop musician Mason Jennings and keyboardist Money Mark. Johnson says the record label is not driven by dollar signs. ""We never try to talk anybody into joining the label, but we just offer a lot of creative control over all their music and a fairer deal than with most other labels,"" he explains.  Watch Johnson, Zach Gill and Money Mark perform ""Hope"" » . Rogue Wave frontman Zach Schwartz is one of the converts. ""The music business is traditionally pretty cutthroat, nasty and evil, but [with Brushfire], it is not that way,"" he tells CNN. ""You can make the music you want to make."" Still, even in these major-label-dominated times, artist-friendly labels aren't unusual; Dave Matthews has also attracted talent with his ATO Records. It's in making Brushfire a model of green business that Johnson and his colleagues have stood out. As keen environmentalists, Johnson and his team have required Brushfire and its distributors to engage in earth-friendly implementations that have influenced others in the record business. ""The music is one thing, but there is this business side,"" says Zach Gill, a Brushfire solo artist and member of Johnson's touring band. ""I think more and more businesses are saying, 'Yeah, we want to be responsible. Responsible to our employees. Responsible for the waste our company generates.' We're starting to see that a lot in all kinds of businesses, not just in music,"" he says.  Watch Gill and Johnson perform ""Family"" » . Entertainment industry giant Universal Music Group -- the largest family of record labels in the recording industry -- has taken notice. Under Brushfire's direction, UMG uses recycled stock on all of the packaging for its releases, including movies, ensuring that the paper is as environmentally friendly as possible. Some is even made using wind power. Moreover, Brushfire's artists have exerted their eco-influence on venues and promoters for concert tours worldwide. The tour rider, a checklist of artists' requirements at each venue, usually consists of specific brands of beer or (in one case involving Jennifer Lopez) the way the coffee is stirred. Brushfire uses an EnviroRider, a handbook of eco-friendly options and actions for various components of concert tour production. ""It gets augmented every year. What started out as suggestions are now becoming requirements [for us to play at a venue],"" says Johnson. Johnson and his management also created All At Once, a social action network that provides tools and information to people who want to become more involved in their community and worldwide. Visitors to the All At Once area at tour venues will be rewarded with exclusive music downloads by their favorite Brushfire artists. Johnson's charity, Ohana Charitable Foundation, will match any donation (up to $2,500) to nonprofits made by fans at the shows or online. ""We shrink our carbon footprint always, but we have all these nonprofit groups that we all work with,"" says Johnson. ""Money from the shows goes to these groups and helps bolster their memberships so that after we leave the town, these groups can continue to do good things. So more than just lessening our negative [environmental] impact, it's actually leaving a positive impact [wherever we tour],"" says Johnson. Additional actions taken by Brushfire tours will include fueling tour vehicles with sustainable biodiesel, offering eco-friendly merchandise, working with venues to create waste management programs, onsite recycling and encouraging fans to use alternative transportation. Back at home, Brushfire has adopted a similar strategy. All the power for the recording studios and the offices is generated by solar panels. Insulation is supplied by cotton from scraps of blue jeans. Energy-efficient lighting runs throughout the building. Second-hand furniture is all you will find in its offices. The mission resonates with the other artists on the label's roster. ""For me, it's so great to be a part of the label because so many people provide information about what we can do to make it better -- touring more efficiently, biodiesel -- stuff like that,"" says Jennings. ""I'm learning a ton being around those guys."" At bottom, the atmosphere of collaboration and common purpose is rooted in the shared love of music, says Gill. ""Music is the great synchronizer. They've become quite a wonderful community to be a part of. I feel grateful to Jack for having the idea to bring together all these like-minded people to make music together,"" he says. Johnson agrees. ""It's everything. It is the whole reason to play music. I learn so much from playing with these other musicians,"" he says.",3,10.460370045731823
eeaae2b1233e04307179a940d75dd30845c6144c,CNN,"(CNN) -- Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he is taking a break from his re-election campaign to seek help for alcohol abuse -- hours after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine. ""It's not easy to be vulnerable and this is one of the most difficult times in my life,"" Ford said in a statement Wednesday. ""I have a problem with alcohol, and the choices I have made while under the influence. I have struggled with this for some time."" The statement, provided to CNN by Canada's CTV News, comes after the Toronto Globe and Mail reported on the new video. In the video purportedly filmed Saturday, the newspaper reports Ford is seen smoking what a drug dealer described to the paper as crack cocaine from a copper-colored pipe. Two Globe and Mail reporters viewed the video, and the publication said it was shot in what appears to be Ford's sister's basement. The paper said the substance in the pipe could not be confirmed. The video is part ""of a package of three videos the dealer said was surreptitiously filmed around 1:15 a.m., and which he says he is now selling for 'at least six figures,'"" the paper reported. Leave is immediate . Shortly after the newspaper confronted the Mayor about the video, Ford announced he was taking a break to get help. ""Today, after taking some time to think about my own well-being, how to best serve the people of Toronto and what is in the best interests of my family, I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help,"" he said. His lawyer, Dennis Morris, told CNN that Ford's leave begins immediately. ""He has to take a break to re-energize, because he realizes he has flaws that have to be addressed,"" Morris told CTV. But Morris told the Globe that he questioned the authenticity of the video, and said it is hard to prove what the Mayor is smoking. ""If these guys are drug dealers and there's money involved, they can say whatever they want to get more money, to extract more money from the people who are paying,"" he said of the seller. The Globe said it did not buy the video, adding it purchased screen grabs from the three clips. Fall from grace . Ford's fall from grace started in May 2013 when a cell phone video taken months earlier appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. Despite intense public pressure, he remained defiant and denied using any illicit drugs. In November, the city council stripped him of most of his power as mayor. That didn't stop Ford, though. He ignored calls to enter rehab or resign, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. ""If you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait,"" he said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers. Seeking another term . And none of this stopped Ford from seeking another term in office, something he's done for the past few months despite continued public ridicule and other challenges. In January, he admitted he had suffered a ""minor setback"" after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief while at a fast-food restaurant. Again, he insisted that he'd had a small amount to drink, but he hadn't taken any drugs. ""As you know, I'm a human being -- the same as every one of you,"" he told reporters at the time. ""And I'm entitled to a personal life, and my personal life does not interfere with the work I do, day-in and day-out, for the taxpayers of this great city.""

b250dc38b50eb2d9f0245df35665c72780cb257c,CNN,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Some of Zimbabwe's children are ""wasting away"" as political turmoil and economic crisis have caused a severe food shortage, according to a report from Save the Children. Children sleep in rough conditions on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa. The number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two-thirds in the past year, the report from the UK-based agency said in its appeal to world donors for help. ""There is no excuse for failing to provide this food,"" program director Lynn Walker said. ""The innocent people of Zimbabwe should not be made to suffer for a political situation that is out of their control."" Five million Zimbabweans -- out of a population of about 12 million -- are in need of food aid now, the report said. The group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month. ""We have already been forced to reduce the rations of emergency food we are delivering because there isn't enough to go around,"" the report said. ""If, as we fear, the food aid pipeline into Zimbabwe begins to fail in the new year the millions of people who rely on emergency food aid will suffer."" Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain 28 years ago. There is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash, fuel, medical drugs, electricity and food. President Robert Mugabe blames the crisis on the sanctions imposed on him and his cronies by the West for allegedly disregarding human rights. But Mugabe's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies. As the economy has faltered for almost a decade now, a cholera epidemic is raging, fueled by the collapse of health, sanitation and water services in Zimbabwe. The epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected more than 20,000 people since its outbreak in August. Health experts have warned that the water-borne disease could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted. The political crisis rose to a boil in this year when the opposition party claimed that it won the presidential election, but Mugabe's government refused to recognize the result. Instead, the race was thrown to a runoff, which was boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe signed an agreement with the opposition in September to form a unity government, but a bitter dispute over the division of cabinet seats has prevented its formation. Inflation is so severe that the government was forced to print $10 billion currency notes last week, with each expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread.",7,8.917684490774699
cdbdde264eb03a91a2a167ea1350e41c87805960,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Under cover of darkness, two people wearing dark clothing and ski masks enter a fire truck while its crew is busy with a rescue. They grab keys to secure areas of Washington's subway system and flee. And it all happens just blocks from the Pentagon. In a jittery post-9/11 world, it's small wonder the incident has raised concerns. But Washington Metro officials and authorities in Arlington County, Virginia, attempted to tamp down fears the September 19 theft is terror related. They said the suspects stole numerous items from the truck, and likely did not target the keys. Moreover, the officials said they quickly took unspecified steps to secure the region's transit system. The incident occurred just across an interstate from the Pentagon between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., while the crew tended to a patient. An on-board video-camera captured images of the thieves as they either approached or departed the truck, Arlington Police Department spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said. Both Sternbeck and Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said numerous items were lifted, including the Metro keys. Both declined to say how many keys were taken, or what the keys opened. The fire crew reported the theft promptly, Sternbeck said, and canine dogs were sent to the scene. Sternbeck said police have not released the video of the suspects, but might if detectives feel it would help the investigation.",1,8.403202052810705
17bddf65676de4b5854df361e1703f843c2b04a4,CNN,"(CNN) -- The year was 1890. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky premiered his Sleeping Beauty ballet in St. Petersburg. Vincent van Gogh ended his life, apparently by shooting himself. And Idaho and Wyoming became the 43rd and 44th states of the United States. 1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim. The Bolivian man, who lives in the town of Frasquia, in the arid highlands of Bolivia, showed CNN government documents that seem to confirm he's 123 years old. The documents include a birth certificate showing his birth date as July 16, 1890. There's also a national identity card with the same birth date. Several media outlets published stories about Flores calling him the oldest man alive. But there appear to be several problems with this claim. For starters, neither the birth certificate nor the national identity card is original. ""We were skeptical from the beginning,"" said Stephen Coles, a professor of gerontology at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California in Los Angeles. He's also the director of the Gerontology Research Group, an independent organization that tracks, monitors and verifies claims of longevity. ""He's not the real thing. Carmelo is not 123 years old despite the documents his family has shown. He was not born in the year 1890."" Coles said the first red flag was the fact that Flores is a man. The gerontologist said more than 90% of cases of what his organization categorizes as supercentenarians are women. Jean Louise Calment from France lived to the age of 122. Her case is the longest human lifespan that has been verified with several documents. According to Coles, there are 57 documented and verified cases of people over the age of 110 around the world. Fifty-five are women and two are men. Four other cases are still pending final verification. The Gerontology Research Group has found a document that purportedly shows Flores is actually 107 years old, and not 123. The document is a baptismal certificate. Back in 1890, the Bolivian government didn't record live births or any other demographic data, so it was up to the Catholic Church to register births, deaths and marriages. In any case, the fact that Carmelo Flores Laura has lived for more than a century in the arid highlands of Bolivia at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet is striking. Not only does he walk on his own, but his voice is still commanding. His son Cecilio Flores, who's 65 years old, has to speak loudly in his ear to communicate with him, but his memory seems to be in perfect shape. He doesn't speak Spanish, but his native Aymara, an indigenous language in Bolivia. ""I was born here in the highlands,"" Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish. ""I was not a mischievous child. I was rather calm. I arrived as a young man in Frasquia and worked as herder and farmer. I was very happy with my wife. We never fought. I never cheated on her and we were both very happy."" Flores' wife lived to be over 100 years old. According to family tradition, the secret to a long life is drinking the water that flows down the Illampu Glacier, located not far from Frasquia. Their diet includes no packaged or processed foods, but locally grown plants like barley and quinoa. They hunt a local fox that lives in the Bolivian mountains known regionally as ""zorrino."" 80 year old becomes oldest to climb Mount Everest . Before you get any ideas, the Gerontology Research Group has found that no particular diet, geographical location or kind of water makes people live longer. Coles said it's the genes. ""People who have extreme old age have virtually nothing in common. They don't share the same religion, nutrition or exercise routine. They only have one detail in common: they have relatives who have lived a long time and children (who) also tend to live a long time,"" Coles said. Cecilio Flores said his supercentenarian father had five children, 16 grandchildren and 39 great-grandchildren. ""I constantly congratulate my father,"" he said. ""He took care of me when I was little so I'm now taking care of him. Now it's my turn to make sure he's taken care of."" Cecilio is the only child of Flores still alive. No one in the Flores family doubts that the patriarch is 123 years old. There seems to be no doubt either when it comes to officials. In fact, the government of Bolivia plans to honor Flores by declaring him ""a living heritage"" of the Bolivian people.",7,9.407881330717672
6b9d8baf5419f09ad0b2a02805c57e35d197e52b,CNN,"(CNN) -- In the digital age, war isn't contained to the ground. The Israeli government on Sunday said it has been hit with more than 44 million cyberattacks since it began aerial strikes on Gaza last week. Anonymous, the hacker collective, claimed responsibility for taking down some sites and leaking passwords because of what it calls Israel's ""barbaric, brutal and despicable treatment"" of Palestinians. ""The war is being fought on three fronts,"" Carmela Avner, Israel's chief information officer, said on Sunday in a press release. ""The first is physical, the second is the world of social networks and the third is cyberattacks. ""The attackers are attempting to harm the accessibility of Israel's government websites on an ongoing basis. When events like the current operation occur, this sector heats up and we see increased activity. Therefore, at this time, defending the governmental computer systems is of invaluable importance."" Israel and the military wing of Hamas have been criticized for using ready-to-share images on social media to spread spin about the conflict, which has claimed the lives of about 100 Palestinians and three Israelis since the back-and-forth violence began again Wednesday. There is some dispute about the effectiveness of the cyberattacks. Israel says the attacks have largely been unsuccessful. ""We are reaping the fruits on the investment in recent years in the development of computerized defense systems, but we have a lot of work in store for us,"" Israel's finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, said in a written statement. Reuters quotes him as saying only one website was down for 10 minutes. CNN iReport: Instagram users wage peace in Israel . Anonymous, meanwhile, posted a list of more than 650 Israel-based websites it says it has taken down or defaced since last week. ""They've knocked down websites, deleted databases and have leaked e-mail addresses and passwords,"" Casey Chan wrote Friday for the tech site Gizmodo. ""It's a whopping takedown."" A post on an Anonymous Twitter feed Monday morning said another set of hackers had defaced the Israeli versions of several Microsoft websites, including Bing, MSN and Skype. Visitors to Bing's Israeli site on Monday morning saw an anti-Israel rant instead of a search-engine homepage. ""Microsoft is aware of the site defacements and working to get all sites fully functional,"" a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""At present, we have seen no evidence to suggest the compromise of customer information but will take action to help protect customers as necessary."" A page associated with Anonymous also posted a new threat: ""November 2012 will be a month to remember for the (Israel Defense Forces) and Internet security forces. Israeli Gov. this is/will turn into a cyberwar."" Some observers took this as a sign of an escalating digital battle. ""Beyond mere 'denial of service' tactics that blocked sites with floods of junk data, the hackers also ramped up their attacks to penetrations of any vulnerable target available to them, resulting in tens of thousands of Israeli citizens' and supporters' private data dumped onto the Web,"" wrote Andy Greenberg from Forbes. Others said most of Anonymous' threats have been ""hollow"" so far. ""Today, Anon lacks the talent and semi-cohesion it once boasted across the net, and its most recent online crusade is an embarrassing reminder,"" Sam Biddle wrote for Gizmodo on Monday. ""This is less a war than the hacker equivalent of egging someone's house and then smoking weed behind a Denny's."" The group is calling its campaign #OpIsrael. ""While the Israeli government almost certainly has backups of the aformentioned databases, these attacks as well as the defacements show Anonymous isn't just doing its usual spree of overloading target sites,"" writes another tech blog, TheNextWeb. ""OpIsrael appears to have gotten multiple hackers involved who are interested in doing actual damage, or at least something that is slightly more permanent than just a 404,"" which is the code that appears online when a website won't load. Greenberg, from Forbes, makes the important point that none of this digital damage compares to the loss of life on the ground in the Middle East. ""Anonymous' attacks, of course, hardly register compared with the physical damage inflicted by both sides in the Gaza conflict,"" he wrote.

51823d32eefde682c27a94a79d763fa7fc58416e,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Arab League's decision to impose sweeping sanctions on Syria, a move followed by Turkey, reflects an unprecedented level of collective action by the historically moribund regional body. The Sunday vote by 19 Arab states to punish Syria further isolates Damascus and undermines President Bashar al-Assad's self-proclaimed role as the dominant voice of Arab nationalism. Indeed, the activist role adopted by the Arab League as the 2011 Arab uprisings unfold has been a surprising development: Following decades of issuing lowest common denominator communiques, the league is rapidly emerging as a key regional actor. The Arab League's strong condemnation last spring of Moammar Gadhafi's brutality easily could have been dismissed as a one-off, given the Libyan strongman's success at enraging most Arab leaders over the years. Yet by following up its suspension of Syria from the organization with tough sanctions, it's clear the Arab League is taking on a more muscular role in the unfolding regional drama. There are four main reasons for this new Arab League approach: . First and foremost: The Arab uprisings themselves. If nothing else, the protests of 2011 brought the power of Arab public opinion front and center. Gone are the days when Arab leaders could act with total disregard for their people's opinions. Public opinion throughout the Arab world resoundingly disapproved of Gadhafi's behavior, and now of Assad's. This sentiment is motivating Arab leaders to respond to their people's anger, through the Arab League. The corollary to this is Arab leaders' fear that if they stand idly by while Assad slaughters Syrians, popular resentment could boomerang against them. Whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward Israel and the West, collective Arab opprobrium is now targeted at brutal Arab regimes. If they fail to act, many Arab leaders could suffer political heartache and more popular unrest at home. Getting ahead of this demonstrates that they respond to public opinion, and it helps deflect popular discontent away from domestic issues. On the geo-strategic level, Arab League activism is motivated by a desire to keep the Arabs in the drivers' seat. With the United States largely over the horizon, Arab docility only creates windows of opportunity for non-Arabs to muck about in Middle East diplomacy. Turkey has not succeeded in creating a leading diplomatic role for itself in the region, despite efforts to play an active role in Libya, Yemen and other hot spots. The Arabs want to ensure that this remains the case. Hence, Ankara was relegated to supporting the measures adopted by the Arab League, not initiating them. The other geo-strategic explanation for Arab League activism is Iran. The Arabs, particularly the Gulf states, have long decried Iran's encroachment in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Isolating Iran's key strategic ally in the region -- Assad's Syria -- provides a significant opportunity to roll back some of Tehran's regional gains. Already, Hamas' Damascus-based leadership is looking for a new home and behaving with greater restraint. And when Iran was seen to be meddling in Bahrain's sectarian struggle earlier this year, the Gulf states brutally crushed it -- collectively. With the United States withdrawing from an Iraq they see as now heavily influenced by Iran, the other Arab states have even greater incentive to band together. In taking strong actions, the Arab League claims to want to stave off foreign intervention in Syria. Qatar's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim hinted at this when he said that he ""hoped"" the Arab League's sanctions would obviate the need for foreign intervention. In the short term, a more active Arab role may indeed make non-Arab nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in Libya, the Arab League might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention. This Arab League activism may signal a new regional norm analogous to the United Nations' ""responsibility to protect."" The Arab League has effectively joined the international rejection of the three-century old Westphalian system that enshrined the nonintervention of one state in the domestic affairs of another state. Arab leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow Arab rulers. This is a welcome development, one that could head off other foreign interventions in the Middle East and encourage further collective action against brutal acts some Arab leaders perpetrate against their own people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Danin.",4,9.094144831929759
22e3f16ec7222273133fb84a4af096343f2e4fc4,CNN,"(CNN) -- Does a special woman in your life spend far too much time thinking for herself? You know. Using her brain for original thought? If so, there's a new consumer electronics product out there that's just perfect for her. But not really. It's the ePad Femme -- an 8-inch tablet device designed specifically for women, and already preloaded with special female-friendly apps. As opposed to, say, Angry Birds which, apparently, requires machismo. Yes, it seems the Dubai-based Eurostar Group figured if there's one thing a woman needs, it's a handheld computer specifically engineered to insult her intelligence. I sort of picture the dudes on their R&D team having several glances through an old copy of Cosmo at the dentist's office and immediately declaring a full understanding of the female brain. ""Our data suggest they enjoy yoga."" And then they made the ePad Femme. It's pink! Perhaps they thought about making one for men, as well. But that was always going to be difficult. Our male minds are just too amazingly complex and superior, for it takes a true stroke of brilliance to successfully belch the entire alphabet. And that's something we're good at. Anyway, I guess men and women are just completely different. And maybe that's why they think the ePad Femme makes a perfect gift for your mom. Or your wife. Or your girlfriend. Or your sister. Or, really, any nice lady you'd like to openly disrespect. What's that you say? Anniversary coming up? No problem. ""Here, babe. Have an ePad Femme. It has recipes."" And that's a big selling point for the manufacturer, who proudly boasts that, unlike all the other touchscreen devices on the market, this thing is the only one designed ""exclusively for women."" That's why they preloaded it with those gender-specific apps -- so a poor, hopeless young lady doesn't have to think about which ones she actually, you know ... wants. Because a female would never understand how to search for apps on her own. Plus, it would just divert time away from being a baby factory and personal chef to the real genius in the house. The one who's in the basement, not wearing pants, working on a statistical analysis for his fantasy baseball draft. Of course, these ePad Femme preselected apps will do almost everything a woman needs in life, from helping her create a shopping list to tracking weight loss to whatever it is the perfume app does. ""Do I smell pretty, now?"" ""Not really. Try rubbing it against your head."" At this very moment, everyone at the Eurostar Group office in Dubai is likely overjoyed by the ePad Femme's sudden emergence on the Web. Though they hope to ""explore all markets,"" right now the device is only sold in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Still, it's trending worldwide. Because it's completely insane. It actually first came out in October as a gift idea -- presumably for the guy who doesn't mind sleeping on the couch. Now, for some strange reason, it's making an internet comeback. Maybe it's the price point. The ePad Femme only costs $200. And it runs on the Android operating system. So, look out Apple. There's a new sexy sheriff in town. It's pink! But what about power and memory? With a 1.5GHz processor and 16GB of memory storage, the manufacturers made the ePad Femme perfectly equipped for even the longest grocery lists. Guys, your lady could literally spend all day at the market buying food before coming home to cook. For you! Look, you've worked hard tweeting critical thoughts on your favorite football team. That's exhausting. So, just relax while she enjoys a little Girl Power in the produce aisle. Plus, what if you decided to have a man-party with your man-friends, and you were planning to watch man-sports and maybe play man-games like ""tickle time"" and RISK? Clearly, you're going to need a lot of man-supplies. With the ePad Femme in your house, you can simply shout upstairs to your woman and demand she start a list. Chips. Dip. Klondike Bars. Whatever you need. She won't forget a single item for her king. And while she does all the shopping -- her very favorite hobby -- you can do far more important things like pass gas and watch fistfights on World Star Hip Hop. On your iPad. Holla! Yes, Eurostar Group literally thought of everything when it comes to the ePad Femme. Sure, they made a few assumptions about what women want, but where they skipped out on any actual science and dignity, they've passed the savings on to you. And you know what else? It's pink!",2,11.808699089323536
ea52e75c7fa8f5912902dea6c8a38092e3ce3944,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pledging to take ""the air out of golden parachutes,"" President Obama announced Wednesday that executives of companies receiving federal bailout money will have their pay capped at $500,000 under a revised financial compensation plan. $500,000 will be the limit on executive salaries at companies receiving tax dollars, President Obama says. Last year's ""shameful"" handout of $18 billion in Wall Street bonuses ""is exactly the kind of disregard for the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain at the expense of everything else,"" Obama said to reporters at the White House. ""For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's a bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so that when firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks,"" the president added. Under Obama's plan, companies that want to pay their executives more than $500,000 will have to do so through stocks that cannot be sold until the companies pay back the money they borrow from the government. The rules will be implemented by the Treasury Department and do not need to be approved by Congress. The restrictions will most affect large companies that receive ""exceptional assistance,"" such as Citigroup. The struggling banking giant has taken about $45 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. The new rules also will mandate that shareholders of banks have a greater say about the salaries paid to company heads. The measures will put in place greater transparency for costs such as holiday parties and office renovations. Obama also pledged further reforms in the future, promising that the administration will ""examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and quarter-by-quarter mentality that in turn have wrought havoc in our financial system.""  Watch Obama talk about limiting executive salaries » . ""We're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management and rewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks,"" Obama said.

d7345c83e7d39bf35bbe88e41b895db05c82d9ab,CNN,"(CNN) -- Sometime around the mid-1990s, the reality show was born. Since then, the genre has taken the world by storm: Audiences continue to love these shows and they cost next to nothing to make (cheap video, cheap sets, amateur ""actors,"" etc.). So the profit margins are huge. If you're a producer, what's not to like? Of course, there are few who would have much positive to say about the artistic values involved. Still, we seem to find reality riveting. Until it comes to America's space program. Here, general audiences greatly prefer fiction. The much-anticipated film ""Gravity,"" for example, opened in the United States this past weekend to rave reviews and a record-breaking box office take of $55.8 million. Ask anyone on the street, and chances are they are aware of the film, or at least have heard something about it. 5 things that couldn't happen in 'Gravity' Then consider: Two weeks ago, a Soyuz rocket launched the next astronaut crew to the International Space Station and there was barely a collective yawn, because practically nobody in the general population knew or cared! Why do general audiences love ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and other science fiction films, but don't seem to care about what is going on in real space exploration? Here is my take on it: . 1. We've made it look easy for so long that the only time people pay attention is when there is an emergency or an accident. People got used to everything going well. That's boring to them. I have to admit that I can't sit through films of myself doing spacewalks. We didn't mess anything up, or go floating off into space to a slow terrifying death, so where's the excitement? 2. Reality space exploration is done by professionals. The back and forth between astronauts and mission control is intentionally succinct and to the point, with no unnecessary emotion. Better to watch an exciting reality TV show with name calling, hair pulling and other tantrums! Who knows what will happen next? 3. Reality space hardware doesn't look cool enough. I was training for my third space mission when Michael Bay and crew came to NASA to film parts of ""Armageddon."" Later, I had a chance to visit a set in Southern California during additional filming. I have to say that their fake space suits, spacecraft and other hardware looked very cool indeed, much more cool than the reality stuff I was going to use! 4. The physics of reality spaceflight are also boring. Orbital mechanics can be quite complex. Maneuvers and orbit changes are performed precisely and deliberately, and take some time. Much more exciting to have spacecraft ""fly"" like winged jet fighters in space, like in ""Star Wars."" How boring would those battle scenes have been had their maneuvers been technically accurate? What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' Nonetheless, the actual experience of spaceflight trumps all movie cool. There is nothing like working hard in a space suit helping assemble a space station, while every now and then stealing glimpses of the surreal view of continents and oceans rolling by below. There is nothing like riding a rocket to orbit, or watching the plasma glow envelop your spacecraft during entry, as bits of burning heat shield go flying past the porthole. There's nothing like approaching a space station and actually flying the spacecraft to a docking. I'll take reality space any day. Now, having said all that, I have watched ""Gravity."" Ignoring technical inaccuracies, I enjoyed it. And I am newly grateful that NASA had no such technical inaccuracies during my flights. Watch for my review!

Forecasters immediately dropped hurricane warnings for the storm as it never reached the 74 mph threshold necessary for hurricane status. It was the third landfall for the storm, which came ashore in western Cuba Sunday night and then again over Key West Monday afternoon. Voluntary evacuations were urged Monday evening on Marco Island, a community of about 12,000 people near Naples on southwestern Florida's coast. However, a CNN crew reported many people seemed to be staying and few had boarded windows there. At of 5 a.m. ET Tuesday, the storm was moving north-northwest at 9 mph (15 km/hr) and was on the Florida coastline at Cape Romano, or about 55 miles (90 km) south of Fort Myers.

8302c920a77332aa2b77201c8f21f47026e7913a,CNN,"(CNN) -- She was getting out of the car one autumn day in 2009, about to have lunch with a colleague, when Este Osofsky-McGonigle felt something pop in her neck. ""It was something so strong I couldn't talk for a couple of minutes,"" recalls the New York school psychologist. But it passed, and she regained her speech. The rest of the day and night elapsed normally, but at 9:30 the next morning, as Osofsky-McGonigle finished up a meeting at work, her right arm went numb. She went into her office and tried to write a letter, ""Dear So-and-So."" But when she picked up the pen and tried to write the letter ""D,"" the pen just slid across the paper. Osofsky-McGonigle tried again, but the same thing happened. ""The 'D' went crazy,"" she said. Fortunately, Osofsky-McGonigle could still run -- and she did, running the whole length of the school building, seeking a friend who sent her to the school nurse. The nurse checked for a pulse in Osofsky-McGonigle's right arm, but found none. By the time she reached the hospital 15 minutes later, she could not lift her right arm or leg, speak or understand words. Osofsky-McGonigle, at 47 and in near-perfect health, was having a stroke. What happens during a stroke . The ""pop"" she felt in her neck the day before was her carotid artery tearing, a rare event called a carotid dissection. The carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood to the brain. A blood clot formed after the dissection, and a piece of it likely broke off and traveled into an artery in her brain, blocking blood supply and resulting in an ischemic stroke, explained Dr. Daniel Antoniello, the attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center who treated Osofsky-McGonigle. Ischemic stroke, which results from a blocked blood vessel, is the most common type of stroke and represents about 87% of all strokes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hemorrhagic strokes, which involve bleeds in the brain, make up the remainder. Most of the 800,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year occur among people age 65 and older, the CDC says. Unfortunately, doctors are seeing more and more strokes in younger people, partly because of the continuing epidemic of childhood obesity, early onset diabetes and cholesterol and hypertension issues, said Antoniello. No one knows why Osofsky-McGonigle's artery tore, especially at such a young age. She had not suffered a recent injury, nor did she have any traditional risk factors for vascular disease such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. She may have simply been unlucky -- but after that, she was as lucky as any stroke survivor could be. Timing is the main factor determining whether a person lives or dies -- or lives with a severe disability -- after a stroke. May is National Stroke Awareness Month. Thanks to the alert school nurse, Osofsky-McGonigle made it to the emergency room about an hour and 20 minutes after her first symptoms. That left doctors plenty of time to administer the only approved treatment for ischemic stroke -- a clot-busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. Generally speaking, tPA is only effective and only given within a 4.5-hour time window after stroke symptoms appear, said Antoniello. About an hour after that, Osofsky-McGonigle underwent a procedure in which doctors threaded a catheter through an artery in her groin all the way up into her brain. Once the catheter reached the clot, doctors squirted more tPA directly into the clot. Stroke victims don't call 911, delay crucial treatment . ""That dissolved the clot and restored blood flow,"" Antoniello said. Still, no one knew how well Osofsky-McGonigle would recover. After the procedure, she was in intensive care. The next day, she still couldn't speak or understand anything. On the second day, when Antoniello asked her to name some simple objects in her hospital room -- a pen, glasses, a watch -- she could not utter the words. ""She would try, but a jumbled mess would come out,"" he said. Osofsky-McGonigle had aphasia, a common outcome of stroke in which parts of the brain related to language, including reading, writing and talking, are damaged. Although some people experience a full recovery from aphasia, others only get part of their previous abilities back. How well a person recovers from stroke is highly variable and highly individual, Antoniello said. By the third day, though, Osofsky-McGonigle, who was also starting to move her right arm and leg, could name one or two simple items -- and her recovery took off from there. She was moved to a rehabilitation facility. At first, she made mistakes identifying family and friends, but soon could state who everyone was. ""That was a big promotion for me,"" she said. As soon as she got home, she said, she was bossing her husband, Ray, and son Zachary around. ""I said, 'Zachary, get the radio off,' but it was the TV I was talking about, so he said, 'It's the TV, not the radio.' I said, 'OK, get the TV off.' Osofsky-McGonigle started driving again and went back to work in early December 2009, a mere five weeks after her stroke. By any standard, she experienced an astounding recovery. ""It is absolutely remarkable that someone like her had such a severe impairment and then went back to work as a psychologist two months later,"" Antoniello said. ""There are not many people that make recoveries like her."" Once blood flow was restored, the damaged parts of Osofsky-McGonigle's brain started to ""come back on board,"" he said. Later on, different parts of her brain may have rewired for any areas that were permanently damaged. Today, she shows no evidence of a speech impairment. She attributes much of her recovery to determination. ""I couldn't afford to deteriorate,"" she said. ""I had a lot of things in my life lined up and I couldn't afford to be in any way less than what I was."" Robotic system may help stroke patients .",8,5.459806574325176
69bb84ee65e7af21f1429f5021a88b1980738dce,CNN,"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says relations with China are ""extremely important,"" but Beijing's demand for an apology and compensation over the detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain is ""completely groundless and is utterly unacceptable for Japan."" The statement Saturday went on to assert Japanese jurisdiction over the islands where the captain was detained and declared that the dispute was handled in accordance with Japanese law. Zhan Qixiong was detained earlier this month after his trawler collided with Japanese vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. He was freed on Friday. Earlier, Satoru Sato, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, made similar statements to Japan's Kyodo news agency in response to China's apology demand. Despite this call for an apology, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the two sides should resolve the problems through dialogue and consultation, according to Chinese state media. Zhan was accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed their duties, China's Xinhua news agency said. He arrived home safely on Saturday, according to Xinhua. ""We decided to suspend the charges in consideration of the Japan-China relationship,"" the Japanese prosecutor in the case said. The arrest tensions between the two countries, with Beijing accusing Japan of ""unlawful and invalid"" arrest of the captain and his crew of 14, according to Xinhua. China considers the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China its property, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources . that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Word of the captain's release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China. The four are being investigated for entering a military zone without authorization and videotaping military targets, Chinese state media said. Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.",7,9.7030141815414
a5f2644f0295790dd1727ff7f617e67bd4b9d3f6,CNN,"(CNN) -- This was not in the script. In a season where Real Madrid has appeared irrepressible at times, a 1-1 draw against relegation-threatened Valladolid was not what manager Carol Ancelotti might have anticipated. A ninth minute injury to Cristiano Ronaldo, making him doubtful for this weekend's game against Celta Vigo and perhaps even the Champions League final, merely rubbed salt into the wounds. Ronaldo appeared to leave the field as a precautionary measure with a hamstring strain before his teammates were forced to settle for a frustrating point against a resilient Valladolid. The result leaves Real four points adrift of leader Atletico, who face Malaga on Sunday before a final day showdown with Barcelona. ""It is practically gone now but while there is a mathematical chance then Madrid are obliged to keep going,"" goalscorer Sergio Ramos told reporters. ""It has been a long season and it takes its toll on the body. ""We wasted a unique opportunity and we will now have to examine it calmly. With 10 minutes to go we relaxed, and against a side battling for survival, they are always going to make it difficult for you,"" The title is now surely between leader Atletico Madrid and second place Barcelona. Should Barcelona defeat Elche, it will need to see off Atletico at Camp Nou to claim the title. Real, which began the contest without the injured Gareth Bale, adjusted to the loss of Ronaldo and moved ahead 10 minutes before the break. Ramos, who has scored five goals in his past four games, unleashed a fine free-kick from 25-yards which flew into the net. The home side, which has struggled throughout the season for goals, improved after the interval and slowly took the initiative. And it came as little surprise when Humberto Osorio headed home Marc Valiente's corner with five minutes of normal time remaining. The loss of Ronaldo, who has scored 31 league goals this season and 50 in all competitions, will be of greatest concern to Ancelotti. Real faces Atletico in the Champions League final on May 24 in Lisbon and will be keeping a close eye on the Portugal midfielder over the next week. Anceloitti's side, which takes on Celta Vigo in its next match, finishes the campaign at home to Espanyol on May 18.",7,11.75331492193007

2b8d78f1b7bd8b658dd83ce203d432d8dae689dd,CNN,"(CNN) -- The last South Korean employees left Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea Tuesday morning as the struggle over the scenic mountain facility continued. Fourteen South Koreans and two Chinese workers left after 11 a.m. Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said. The ministry said it had no idea when the workers might return. The move came a day after North Korea announced it would seize all assets in the area. The joint project at Mount Kumgang was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation between the two Koreas and to give North Korea a chance to earn money. But Seoul suspended South Korean tours to the facility after the 2008 shooting of a South Korean tourist by a North Korean soldier when the woman allegedly walked into an off-limits area. North Korea said Monday it would seize the South Korean properties that it said had been abandoned by Seoul and gave the remaining South Korean employees 72 hours to leave. South Korea has rejected the North's threats. The Unification Ministry issued a statement saying, ""We cannot accept North Korea's unilateral announcement of freezing South Korean assets in Mount Kumgang. We demand the situation be restored immediately."" South Korea says it wants security assurances from the North before allowing South Koreans tour groups to return to the resort. North Korea wanted the tour groups resumed immediately. Pyongyang has periodically threatened to seize the resort unless the tours -- a key source of foreign currency for the impoverished regime -- were resumed. Recent talks failed between the two sides and Hyundai Asan, a private South Korean business that invested millions of dollars in the project.",7,10.949189185653001
5b93b6c84a9978b35f46de61a6558a2627a69624,CNN,"(CNN) -- Mariah Carey is known for her five-octave voice, her slinky dresses and her many hits, including ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" Unfortunately, she is also known for her tardiness. And her behavior this week at the Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony in New York won't do anything to help that reputation. Because of her history, NBC decided to tape Carey singing her holiday classic before a live audience Tuesday night, then air it Wednesday for the network's coverage of the 82nd annual Rockefeller Center tree lighting. But the self-titled Queen of Christmas kept the audience waiting for three hours Tuesday before NBC made the decision to cancel the performance. According to TMZ, Carey was delayed because she was meeting with her lawyer about her divorce settlement with husband Nick Cannon. Carey took to Twitter to apologize for failing to show up. But some fans were already annoyed. Her no-show forced NBC to air Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" live during its broadcast of the tree-lighting Wednesday night. The diva was on time, but many observers are saying her performance was less than stellar. Decked out in a tight red gown before a backdrop of costumed children, Carey seemed winded and had trouble hitting some of her trademark high notes. A clip of Carey's raw microphone feed, without backing instrumentation, also was leaked to YouTube -- and probably did not do her any favors. Twitter lit up during and after, with most of the tweets admonishing the singer for a lackluster performance. Still, some fans rallied to her side.

b4b27f5e054133a5bb3ab6b9a4e7dd182a7a0752,CNN,"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Flicking through her photos on her living room couch, Julia Quinn recounts the array of plastic surgery procedures she has undergone. ""That is when I had my eye done again, a bump taken out of my nose,"" she says, looking at a photo of her severely swollen face. There isn't much cosmetic surgery that this housewife from Surrey in the UK has not had done. A few years ago, feeling unhappy about the lines around her eyes and mouth, she first dabbled in surgery. She opted for a private clinic in the UK, but after a bad experience there she started looking around for alternative places to get the work done. That's when she first discovered that South Africa offered the same procedures at a fraction of the cost, she says. ""You get a lot of good surgeons and dentists in South Africa,"" says Quinn. ""It's like a holiday -- you are looked after, the weather is fine."" January is a good time to flee the UK's winter weather, so Quinn is heading back to Johannesburg for more work. This time it's a mini facelift and more liposuction. In total, she will have spent nearly $15,000 on surgery in South Africa. She says should would have spent a lot more if she had continued to be treated in the UK. In a suburb in northern Johannesburg Lorraine Melvill is running around trying to organize hospital visits for her clients staying in her guest house. She started her business, ""Surgeon and Safari,"" back in 2000 and since then she has had people from all over the world, including Quinn, come to her to facilitate their cosmetic procedures, and perhaps go on safari too. See also: School boy's wildlife-tracking website helps safari tourists . ""For most people in the first-world economies like the UK, and especially in America, their biggest desire is to go on African safari,"" she explains, ""and yet their greatest want in their life was to have plastic surgery, so why not put the two together?"" Like most companies, however, Surgeon and Safari was hit by the global financial crisis, particularly as a number of Melvill's clients were borrowing money to afford their procedures. She says: ""When there was a greater volume of people coming through then it was people who were borrowing money, for example, or using their credit cards to pay for the plastic surgery. So they weren't necessarily as educated or as financially secure, they weren't the typical baby boomer. ""So when the economic recession came along, that was the first market that dropped away because, obviously, there was a credit crunch, so that's the first thing you stop spending your money on, something like plastic surgery."" However, whilst the United States and eurozone economies may have languished, Melvill says she has benefited from the growth of some African countries' economies. ""There is a huge emergence of local Africans that chose to come to South Africa for elective surgery, whether it be breast reduction, tummy tucks, lipo,"" she says. ""I would say one of the biggest countries is Zambia,"" she adds. ""There is quite a big market coming out of Angola, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana ... Their economies are growing and therefore their middle classes are growing and therefore the need increases."" See also: The New Hollywood? Cape Town takes on Tinseltown . Chetan Patel works at Johannesburg's private Mediclinic, in Sandton. In the three years that he has been a private cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon, he says that he has also seen an increase in clients flying in from parts of sub-Saharan Africa. ""Certainly we are seeing people from very high income groups,"" says Patel. ""From a regional African point of view, countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, the DRC, all play an important role where socio-economic factors all dictate that there are more and more people who can afford this kind of surgery and so we are seeing a larger amount of those people coming certainly to Johannesburg for that kind of surgery."" See also: South Africa bids to become call center capital . These clients are very clear about what work they want done, says Patel. ""For instance, they would come to me and say 'I would like Jennifer Lopez's butt' or 'I would like to look like Kim Kardashian,' and the obvious body features of those two individuals are curvaceous hips and thighs with an augmented or accentuated buttock. ""Other than that, I think more and more African women are conscious of what their lower bodies look like, so what their tummy looks like, so they would like tummy tuck procedures, for instance."" Cosmetic surgery isn't new to Africa -- after all, in 2005, the wife of the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo died after having liposuction in a Spanish clinic. But Patel says that from what he is seeing this is no longer just the preserve of the super rich or political elites. ""It is not a necessity it is a luxury, so I see the trend [in having plastic surgery in] the next five to 10 years increasing amongst people from the rest of Africa,"" he says. For now, though, it's people like Quinn who are keeping Melvill and Patel busy; repeat customers are the norm in the area of elective surgeries, Melvill says. But whilst Quinn will be having her surgery in South Africa, and will be recuperating in the sunshine, she has decided against going on safari. In fact, Melvill says that these days most of her clients opt instead to spend the day on a different type of safari; they choose to visit the nearby designer shops.",8,7.634482398641351

0b30f402176c2c2315fe346252b4019b9dc619f7,CNN,"New York (CNN) -- He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago, a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace. Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do. And, indeed, he was correct. Pat Maris deserved to hear the words ""I juiced"" straight from the artificially enhanced horse's mouth; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago; why her late husband's single-season home run mark (arguably the most hallowed standard in all of American sports) had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a Times Square pickpocket. Think back, if you will, to September 8, 1998, when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium, then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children. Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark. ""I touched it with my heart,"" he said. ""When I did that, I knew tonight was going to be the night. I can say my bat will lie next to his, and I'm damn proud of it."" By all accounts, back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow, one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark. And now? ""I think she was shocked when I called,"" McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas  on the MLB Network. ""She was disappointed and she has every right to be."" In case you haven't received the official memo, protocol dictates this as the time when we're supposed to forgive, forget and move forward. Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone. Yes, it was against the law. Yes, they are termed performance-enhancing drugs for a reason. But in the world of Major League Baseball, where the phrase ""manning up"" is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display, a new, steroid-era definition has been established: . Manning Up (verb): When someone is caught cheating and, following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial, has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for $15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder. The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms. So, like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him, Mark McGwire finally ""manned up."" Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong. Well, very wrong. Well, pretty wrong. Well, sorta wrong. Well, uh, not really wrong at all. Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses, McGwire apologized for, ahem, nothing. Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids. ""Absolutely,"" McGwire said. ""I was given this gift by the man upstairs."" Costas asked whether the steroids made him stronger. ""The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes,"" McGwire said. ""I did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes."" Costas asked which drugs he had used. ""The names,"" McGwire said, ""I don't remember."" Heck, Costas tossed the ultimate underhand softball question, just to help a guy out--Did McGwire feel as if he was cheating? ""As I look back now as far as my health and my injuries, trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal, I can see why people would say that,"" he said. ""As far as the God-given talent and hand-eye coordination and the genetics I was given, I don't see it."" And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it. By using PED, he didn't merely take Maris' record. No, McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere. He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players. He won Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked. He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history--real, honest-to-goodness history--when, in fact, it was all a WWE-styled illusion. Pat Maris received her phone call.

433c131fa2d691cd4bf895a2baa14073de3141af,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""App"" has been a computing term for a lot longer than five years. But, on July 10, 2008, it began its journey to becoming a household word. That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world. The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads. But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones. 'Angry Birds' Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have ""Angry Birds"" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire. Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush' Google Maps . With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?) Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions.

e5aecc424b6b30143f100bc4fad5966f18a6d99f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Israel, by necessity, has developed one of the most able security and intelligence apparatus in the world. There has been no necessity to develop a world-class political apparatus, however, and it shows. In a single week, the Israeli army's chief of staff, the former head of internal security and the former head of external security have all publicly questioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judgment on Iran. While the current army chief spoke narrowly about the Iranian government, the former security officials directed their fire at Israeli politicians. On Friday, the former internal security chief told an Israeli audience, ""I don't believe in a leadership that makes decisions based on messianic feelings"" -- and he was speaking not of Iran, but of Israel. Last week was Israel's independence day, traditionally an occasion of pride and celebration. Instead, Israelis are in a deep funk. At its founding in 1948, Israel seemed an improbable state. An ingathering of Jews from Eastern Europe, the Arab world and beyond had no real economy, no common language and no common idea of what it was to be an Israeli. Tensions between religious Jews and secular Jews, European Jews and Oriental Jews, and Jews and Arabs simmered for decades. They made accommodations in the name of survival, but few conceded the fight for control of the state. To hear many Israelis tell it now, their nation has become an impossible state. Politics are more contentious than ever. The Israeli welfare state is in full view, as the religious, the poor and the religious poor make increasing demands on the state. Prices are skyrocketing, and the public feels squeezed. A diminishing number of Israelis serve in the army, which once prided itself on universal conscription. Although the old distinctions between Polish and German Jews have faded, many Oriental Jews continue to feel disenfranchised, the rising political prominence of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union has created another tribe in Israel, and the poor and disempowered Ethiopian Jews yet one more. Politics in Israel has always been a contact sport, but rather than battle to win over the center, an increasing number of political battles are conducted entirely on the fringes. Small religious parties seek greater social spending for their constituents, while a party representing secular Russian Jews focuses on undermining a law exempting ultra-Orthodox Israelis from military service. In election after election, the major parties' share of the vote diminishes, leading to weak coalitions that are ideologically incoherent and that are forced to dole out Cabinet posts and largesse to their members to stay in power. Governments become tentative and fragile. The problems call for decisiveness, but the politicians rarely feel they can afford to be. For Israelis, Iran is an excruciating problem. They rely on intelligence that is never as good as they wish it to be, try to assess accurately actions of people they don't know well and do so with potentially devastating consequences for a wrong move. Israelis also debate Iran with a clarity few other countries can muster: If bombs fell on Israel, how many people have access to fallout shelters? Are the disastrous forest fires of 2010 a sign that Israel's disaster response is simply not up to the task of a military confrontation? What would a military confrontation look like anyway, and could it be won? Israel's last war against another state's army was almost 40 years ago. Its subsequent confrontations have had less clear results. The Israeli political class struggles to consider these issues and more. Should Israel do more to seek peace with the Palestinians? Can it reverse increasingly hostile relations with Turkey? Is a wealth of recently discovered natural gas in the Mediterranean the country's economic salvation? Can Israel do anything about shifting politics in Egypt and the rest of the Arab world that are sidelining pragmatists who sought an accommodation with Israel? And more fundamentally, what is it to be a Jewish state when Israelis themselves cannot agree on who is the arbiter of Jewishness? None of these problems is especially new, but the political forces in Israel seem increasingly unable to confront them. Israelis have traditionally sought political salvation from former generals. Many of Israel's greatest political personalities, from Yitzhak Rabin to Ariel Sharon, came out of the military establishment. For more than a decade, former leaders on the security front have tried to step forward to consolidate Israeli politics toward the middle. Former Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai formed the ill-fated Center Party in 1999, and Sharon formed the centrist Kadima Party in 2005. The security veterans' recent critiques fit into the same pattern, and they may boost the political aspirations of newcomer Yair Lapid, whose background is in media rather than the battlefield. Yet tactics communicated at high volume are not the same as strategy, and Israelis increasingly complain that the former keep substituting for the latter. It is a sign of the vibrancy of Israeli political life that authoritative voices can come out and critique government policy. It is a sign of the weakness of Israeli politics that so many of Israel's same problems persist and so many coalitions remain fragile. For many outside of Israel, it is Israel's position on Iran that is truly consequential, and the rest is commentary. For Israelis, the roiling debate on Iran is just another example of the way Israeli politics work. Israeli politics are not likely to change quickly, and the challenges Israelis feel from Iran are not likely to go away quickly either. Therein lies the rub. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon B. Alterman.",3,10.585908059257344
9377742c36c655cc90e990ab0aed4b82361cb1f9,CNN,"(CNN) -- The streets of Berlin have turned black, red and gold as up to a million flag-waving fans gather in the German capital to welcome home the nation's World Cup-winning footballers. Germany's national side flew in from Rio de Janeiro -- where they beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time on Sunday to secure their fourth championship -- on Tuesday morning to a heroes' welcome. Mario GÃ¶tze (@MarioGoetze), who scored the winning goal at the Maracana, tweeted a photo of the team on the bus from the plane to the airport terminal, announcing that they had arrived home. Boarding an open-top Mercedes truck and trailer emblazoned with the years of their four World Cup victories -- 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014 -- the team threaded its way through the city along roads lined with tens of thousands of cheering fans. The players, dressed in black t-shirts, each bearing a large number 1, and proudly displaying their winners' medals, waved to those below, who held aloft cardboard signs proclaiming ""We are all world champions!"" Stars including a grinning Mesut Ã–zil (@MesutOzil1088) tweeted photos of themselves taken from the trailer and marveled at the huge number of supporters who had turned out to greet them: ""What a crowd!"" the Arsenal midfielder posted. ""Unbelievable!"" One enthusiastic fan displayed a banner announcing to the team's goalkeeper: ""Neuer, I want to have your baby."" Others rode their bikes alongside the vehicle, wearing German flags as capes and snapping photos on their phones as they cycled towards the city center. At the Brandenburg Gate there was a festive atmosphere, as the sea of supporters -- many of whom had taken the day off to be there -- waited patiently for hours for a glimpse of the team. ""We're so incredibly proud,"" one woman told CNN. ""It's a great day for Germany. I'm a waitress but I wouldn't have missed today - everyone is off work!"" For others, a trip to the ""Fanmeile"" fans' zone was ""The best lunchbreak of all time."" Some had traveled long distances to join in the celebrations. ""We've come from Frankfurt this morning,"" another fan explained. ""We arrived at 4.30 a.m. -- we just had to come. I'm proud to be German, I'm looking forward to seeing my favorite player Schweinsteiger on stage."" Those who couldn't be there in person took part on Twitter, with Alex (@pixxelrunner) tweeting from Hamburg that he had ""goosebumps"" watching the ""craziness"" unfold in Berlin. The crowds erupted in huge cheers as the team finally took to the stage -- several hours later than expected, because of their slow progress on the 11km route through the jammed city streets. Dancing, clowning around, playing air guitar and singing ""We are number one!"" the players thanked the crowd for their support. Captain Philipp Lahm showed off the trophy, passing it to his fellow players, including midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, draped in a German flag and beaming, despite the large plaster covering the cut to his face sustained in Sunday's final. Tweeting a photograph of several members of the team in front of thousands of fans, Ã–zil thanked the huge numbers who had joined the street party -- which looked set to go on throughout the day and well into the night.

b2739f63bf1186783cd9fe93c4719281aa8584ab,CNN,"(CNN) -- Like any good businessman, Dick Clark saw his opportunities and took them. When rock 'n' roll was establishing itself as the new pop music, Clark was there on the ground floor, taking over a Philadelphia dance party TV show called ""Bandstand."" When ""Bandstand"" proved to be a valuable tool for promoting new artists -- and, not incidentally, sanitizing them for Mom and Dad's approval -- Clark made sure it did its job, especially after it went national as ABC's ""American Bandstand."" As his career continued, he replaced the stodgy Guy Lombardo as the face of New Year's Eve, challenged the Grammys with the American Music Awards, filled daytime with quiz shows and prime time with variety programs, and was always on the lookout for the next big thing. Clark, who died Wednesday, became a force in the music industry and used his leverage to expand to television, radio and real estate. ""America's Oldest Teenager"" he may have been called, but behind that youthful countenance were the brains of a born entrepreneur. ""I knew being a performer does not necessarily carry with it a lot of longevity. That's why I became a producer,"" Clark, who had a degree in business from Syracuse University, once said. Even his critics had to agree -- perhaps grudgingly, perhaps admiringly -- that he was nothing if not shrewd. In 1968's ""Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom,"" his insightful history of pop, rock critic Nik Cohn dismissed Clark as ""an all-American choirboy"" who reigned as the father of ""highschool,"" the squeaky-clean Paul Anka-Connie Francis-Frankie Avalon pop music that dominated the late '50s and early '60s. Cohn expressed little love for the music of highschool, but he obviously respected Clark's abilities. ""You'd be making no wild guesses to imagine that he was one of the very richest men in pop,"" Cohn wrote. ""Godly or not, he sure had his head screwed on."" AC360: The business of being Dick Clark . That's the thing about Dick Clark -- he made no apologies about catering to the mainstream, even if it meant shaving off the rough edges of what could be a very rough music. When Lloyd Price's version of ""Stagger Lee"" was climbing the charts, Clark refused to have him on until a cleaner version could be recorded. ""His audience could not be exposed to a song which celebrated gambling and murder,"" wrote Dave Marsh in his book ""The Heart of Rock and Soul."" The song was cleaned up, Clark booked Price, and ""Stagger Lee"" went to No. 1. He was in the business of family entertainment -- a broadcaster in the truest sense of the term, says John Covach, a rock historian and chair of the music department at the University of Rochester. ""He was able to position himself in the center of the television and music industry in the way that allowed him to have a career that spanned a half a century,"" Covach says. From Clark to Kirshner to Cornelius . In that respect, he inspired a number of contemporaries and followers, including Don Kirshner, who started as a song publisher and later expanded to record labels, TV shows and other programming; Don Cornelius, a onetime salesman and journalist whose ""Soul Train"" became the crown jewel of his own broadcasting empire; and, of course, Ryan Seacrest, who started as a disc jockey and now hosts and produces television shows. ""If you're presenting pop music on TV, in some way Dick Clark is the person who opened the door,"" says Joe Levy, editor of Billboard magazine. Purists may find it easy to criticize these men, says Kovach, but appealing to the mainstream not only means the largest possible audience -- it means influencing the dialogue. ""That was Berry Gordy's strategy, too -- taking his black singing groups and getting them to a white audience,"" Covach says, referring to the Motown Records founder. ""He took a lot of criticism for having sold out the blackness of the music in search of a more mainstream audience."" But by doing so, Motown gained a larger following -- and influenced generations of musicians. On the other hand, there was Alan Freed, the raucous DJ who was among the first to call the combination of R&B, country and pop music ""rock 'n' roll."" Freed, Covach observes, was the more important figure in rock's early years. While Clark was gaining a national foothold for the Philadelphia-based ""Bandstand,"" Freed was already hosting a national radio show, appearing on a television show and producing movies. But Freed was a more abrasive character than the smooth Clark, and he was more upsetting to the era's establishment. (His prime-time TV series was canceled after African-American singer Frankie Lymon was seen dancing with a white teenage girl.) When the payola scandals of the late '50s engulfed the music industry -- DJs and music business types were given bribes to play certain records -- both Freed and Clark were subjects of scrutiny. But the scandals helped ruin Freed -- he was hurt by negative publicity -- while Clark divested himself of his music business interests and was praised as a hard-working young businessman, Covach says. It also prompted Clark to diversify, says Levy. ""The lesson learned was, 'I need other business interests,' "" he says. ""And that's the model he created."" Turning on adults . Clark wasn't the first to use his talent for entertaining as a springboard to bigger things. Bing Crosby invested in recording equipment, TV stations and horse racing; Gene Autry became a movie producer, rodeo businessman and baseball team owner. But it was Clark who saw the promise in combining pop music, television and the marketplace -- an audience of teenagers and their parents. ""He found that while teenagers avidly watched ['Bandstand'], adults also tuned in to see the teens dance,"" says Covach. That bore dividends when ""The Twist"" started catching on: Clark had a new recording of the Hank Ballard song made by newcomer Chubby Checker and helped make it a hit. It topped the charts twice, the second time because adults got into the craze: A famous picture of the era shows Jackie Kennedy doing the Twist. For all the criticism aimed at Clark, he didn't always play it safe. Levy recalls seeing Public Image Ltd., the prickly band led by former Sex Pistol John Lydon, on ""Bandstand."" The show provided TV debuts for Chuck Berry, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Otis Redding and Jerry Lee Lewis. Clark even changed the fortunes of Lewis' failing, raucous song ""Breathless"" by using it in a promotion with ""Bandstand"" sponsor Beechnut gum. ""Dick Clark bridged a color gap at a time when there should not have been one, giving musical life to black artists that may not have had a chance,"" Stevie Wonder -- another ""Bandstand"" debut -- said in a statement. And, along with the endless awards shows and music-variety packages, Clark also produced a show starring Weird Al Yankovic, a documentary with George Plimpton and the great TV movie ""Elvis,"" directed by John Carpenter and starring Kurt Russell as The King. Moreover, his shows were usually fun to watch. The Golden Globes are regularly disparaged for the outsize influence of the tiny Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but its show -- produced by Clark's production house -- is often considered more entertaining than the Oscars. Nowadays, Seacrest is probably Clark's closest model; the youthful ""American Idol"" host has acknowledged as much in many interviews, and in recent years he joined Clark as host of ABC's ""New Year's Rockin' Eve,"" which Clark established in 1972 -- two years before Seacrest was born. But though Seacrest has been aggressive in going from DJ to ""Idol"" host to Kardashian family/reality show producer, he's got a long way to catch his mentor: The Museum of Broadcast Communications estimates Clark's company produced more than 7,500 hours of programming. It's an impact that will continue to be felt, says Levy: ""He had a real influence on the music business and on the television business."" We're still dancing to his beat.",7,12.823488614328541
ecb2cc9dfa9a33e0dca7224e0ad3431270a244b0,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's shock French Open exit at the hands of a player ranked outside the top 20 is already attracting suggestions that it may be the biggest upset in tennis history. Rafael Nadal faces media after his shock loss to Sweden's Robin Soderling at the French Open on Sunday . Nadal, the world number one had never lost a game at Roland Garros, winning the previous four titles in a row. However, Sweden's Robin Soderling proved too good for the ""King of Clay,"" beating him 6-2 6-7 6-4 7-6. The official French Open Web site called it ""one of the greatest upsets in Grand Slam history,"" while other news outlets have rushed to praise the Swede for the ""game of his life."" The result leaves the men's draw at the French Open tournament wide open -- with Roger Federer and Andy Murray now the highest-ranked players remaining. Undoubtedly a massive upset, Nadal's loss also raises the question of what have been the biggest men's Grand Slam upsets in tennis history. Is this is the biggest? Below, in no particular order, are ten of the most shocking.What do you think the biggest upset in recent tennis history is? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. 1. Robin Soderling beats Rafael Nadal, French Open 2009 Spain's clay master was unbeaten at Roland Garros and looking for his fifth title in a row when he was shocked by the 23rd seed Swedish player. Soderling was too good for Nadal, and deserved the win. 2. Michael Chang beats Lendl and Edberg, French Open 1989 American Michael Chang etched his name in history by winning the 1989 French Open aged just 17 years and three months. He beat legends Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg (in an epic five set final) to win the event and he is still the youngest winner of a Grand Slam. 3. George Bastl beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 2002 Swiss player Bastl was ranked 145 in the world when he took on the seven-time champion of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras. Bastl, who only got into the tournament as a lucky loser after failing to qualify, beat the American in five sets. 4. Mark Edmondson wins the 1976 Australian Open  The Australian only ever won one Grand Slam event, and he beat defending champion John Newcombe in the final to do it. The most remarkable point however, was that he was ranked 212th in the world when he did it. He remains the lowest-ranked player to win a Grand Slam title. 5. Goran Ivanisevic wins 2001 Wimbledon Left-handed Ivanisevic had lost the Wimbledon final three times before he finally won it in 2001. The eventual victory was a near-miracle, as he had only entered the tournament as a wild card. Ranked outside the top 100 at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player and only wild card to win Wimbledon. 6. Mats Wilander wins the 1982 French Open  The young Swede shocked the tennis world when at 17 years of age he beat the second, third, fourth and fifth seeds at Roland Garros to win the tournament. He was unseeded for the event. 7. Richard Krajicek beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 1996 Krajicek surprised everyone when he became the first Dutchman to win Wimbledon in 1996, but the biggest upset had come when he defeated Pete Sampras in the quarter-final. His win was Sampras' only loss at the grass tournament between 1993 and 2001. 8. Gustavo Kuerten wins the 1997 French Open It's no surprise that ""Guga"" was a Roland Garros favorite. When he won the 1997 tournament he was ranked 66th in the world and he beat three former champions along the way. He remains the third-lowest ranked Grand Slam champion. 9. Lleyton Hewitt beats Andre Agassi while ranked #550 The Australian went on to win his first ATP tour title after beating Agassi in the semi-final of the Adelaide International. The win over former world number one Agassi was remarkable given that he was ranked at 550th and only 16 years old. 10. Vladimir Voltchkov makes 2000 Wimbledon semi-final The Belarussian was ranked 237 when he managed to make it through to the semi-finals of Wimbledon -- becoming the lowest-ranked player to ever make the last four at the London tournament.",7,6.768942631298114
6674db40ce1fd09b70afdd4d8ae977cf79108dbb,CNN,"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel doesn't like losing -- and Formula One's youngest ever triple world champion showed he means business after wrapping up pole position at Sepang Saturday. The Red Bull driver, who started at the front of the grid at Melbourne last weekend, was beaten into third after Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso took the top two spots. Vettel's frustration at failing to make the most of his advantage was palpable, but ahead of Sunday's second race of the season in Malaysia, he demonstrated once again why he's the man to beat. The Circuit: CNN's look at the Malaysian Grand Prix . With the rain causing chaos, the German recorded recorded a fastest time of one minute 49.674 seconds to pip Ferrari's Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, who will start second and third on the grid. ""I think if you start in the front you always want to finish there,"" Vettel told the post-qualifying press conference. ""We confirmed more or less what we saw in Melbourne. I was very happy with the balance of the car once again. ""I think also considering where we were last year here, a big step forward. But these days racing is a little bit different. ""Hopefully we'll find the right amount of percentage less than 100% to start he race tomorrow. ""Managing the tires will be crucial and then we go from there. We know the pace is there so hopefully we get to the checkered flag in the same position."" While Vettel was left content with his performance, last weekend's race winner Raikkonen suffered a disappointing day after being handed a three-place penalty. The Finn had qualified in seventh before stewards adjudged him to have impended the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. ""It's a shame to lose the three places but it is what it is,"" he told Lotus' official website. ""You never know what will happen in the race -- especially here -- so we'll do our best and let's hope we have the speed to get on the podium."" Raikkonen's absence from the top end of the grid is a bonus for Ferrari, with Massa in particular looking to take advantage after out-qualifying Alonso for the fourth race in succession. Read Ferrari revved up for F1 title fight . ""I think whenever you feel comfortable you can do a good lap and you can use the car to the maximum, it's possible,"" he told reporters. ""It was really clear that I was not comfortable last year and the year before, so many things around the car, bad luck, around myself as well, so there were so many things that were not working in the proper direction. ""But now they are and I know how quick I can be, I've showed that many times in the past. ""If everything works well, we can be competitive; it's pretty sure about that. I believe in myself and I think it can be really important for the team, for Fernando as well, for everybody. ""We need a stronger team, a strong position and fighting for the best position in every race so I'm happy, that's a good direction."" Two-time world champion Alonso won at Sepang last season and will be hoping for a repeat performance this time around -- despite being outshone by teammate Massa . ""I think I've been racing 27 years now in motor racing - I'm getting old - so it's not the first time that we have very close competition,"" he told the press conference. ""It was very close the last three years as well, but I know that for you it was not that close in terms of results because I think Felipe had some bad luck, some incidents sometimes, some mechanical problems other times. ""But the last three years was much closer than I think that it looked in the points at the end. ""So this year it is again very close, no big difference, maybe a little bit closer and for sure the last two races we are behind on the grid but so far on Saturday there are no points so we need to keep working for Sunday. ""It's the best news for the team, because we need to have a competition between the two drivers in the team. ""We need to share information between the drivers in the team and now I think all the data that we have from free practice, from qualifying for everything is very useful to compare and to analyze to make ourselves better. ""So this is only good news for the team and we will push each other to our own limits and this is good news for the team. After claiming a fifth place finish in last weekend's season-opener, Lewis Hamilton is aiming for better in his Mercedes. The 2008 world champion will start fourth on the grid and is targeting a podium finish. ""The car was not too bad in the dry but the balance could have been a lot better, then it was pretty tricky conditions in the wet during Q3,"" he told the team's official website. ""We did our lap with older tires than the guys in front, which was a bit unfortunate, but our pace was good overall so I can't complain. ""It's the second race on the second row for me and there are lots of positives to take out of the weekend so far. ""Our long run pace looked pretty good compared to the other teams so I'm hoping for dry conditions tomorrow.""",7,8.334678038715593
0a62d0b17cefb6de9c3816d56f67e0791f98cbd9,CNN,"(CNN) -- When sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 over the death of her 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: just days after her trial, jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the Orlando woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger. But that's precisely the scenario that will play out sometime Sunday when Anthony completes serving her time on four misdemeanor counts of misleading police. Anthony, 25, was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field. She was convicted on four counts of misleading police and was sentenced to four years in prison. After serving nearly three years in prison while awaiting trial, she was ordered released this weekend. The abrupt end to a criminal case that at times transfixed the nation resulted in anger and revulsion as well as donations of cash to her jailhouse account. It's also led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance and move someplace far away. ""If her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs, they're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her, that there have been death threats, that she cannot just walk amongst the population,"" HLN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said. ""That is not just going to happen."" Whatever she ends up doing, first she has to get out of jail. Few details have been publicly released about how Anthony will be let out of the Orange County Jail, where she has been held since her arrest in October 2008. Court officials have released limited information to reporters, mostly plans to bring three journalists inside a secure area of the jail sometime late Friday or early Saturday and cut them off from outside access while they wait for Anthony's release. When exactly Anthony will be freed hasn't been made public. That's in part likely due to the intense emotions Anthony's release has generated. ""I know it's bad God Forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face. With a mack truck,"" one poster on the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page wrote. Another poster, referencing rumored lucrative interview, book and movie deals, said the only thing she'd pay to see or read would be about ""Casey Anthony's dead body."" The page features Anthony's mug shot with a bullseye target on her forehead under the headline ""Hey, Casey, I'd watch out if I were you, just sayin'."" An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail. Sammy Blackwell told CNN affiliate KOTV that a woman who mistook her for Anthony on July 8 rammed her car twice, flipping it over. ""She said that I was trying to hurt babies, I was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again,"" Blackwell told the station. As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities. She says she really doesn't even look that much like Anthony and worries for women who do. Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to Anthony's safety. While he said that the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life, it's a concern that was clearly on his mind. ""Nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands,"" he said. ""Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision. I would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime."" It's also a concern for her attorneys. ""Myself and other members of the team are concerned for her safety, very much so,"" one of her attorneys, Dorothy Sims, told HLN. What Anthony will do after her release is unclear. ""Well if I knew at this point I'm sure you can appreciate that I wouldn't' tell you,"" Sims said. ""I don't believe that that has been resolved. My hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected."" Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery. ""But I think we are going to hear her story because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story,"" she said. Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with. Her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police, and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court. One is filed by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as the name of her daughter's nanny. The other involves a search group that wants Anthony to repay expenses they incurred looking for Caylee. Anthony may be offered money for book and movie deals, but one offer won't be on the table.

2313ab152f13871d04518c85c22286bc515c8d5c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The main road connecting the Syrian capital of Damascus with the city's airport was open, but no flights were operating Friday, according to an opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Fighting between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad disrupted much of the capital, and there was no Internet service throughout much of Syria for a second day. Fighting killed another 106 people across the country, according to an opposition group that counts casualties. Government forces and rebels battled in towns near the airport, which was closed on Thursday, the opposition group said. The possibility it could fall to rebel forces would be a significant development in the nearly two-year conflict. Rebel control of the airport ""would have a psychological effect"" on the government and people who live in Damascus who support the regime, said retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a former top military aide to former President George W. Bush. ""The civilians in Damascus will feel cut off from the outside world,"" Kimmitt said. State run media blamed the violence on ""terrorists."" Al-Assad loyalists and members of the Alawite minority (the al-Assads are Alawites) might flee to neighboring countries, while others could take up arms to defend al-Assad. As the rebels worked on gaining ground at the airport, they told CNN on Friday that they had pushed al-Assad's forces from the al-Omar oilfield in the city of Deir Ezzor, which is in an oil-rich region. They have been battling Syrian forces there for weeks. Al-Assad's forces remain in control of five major oilfields in Deir Ezzor, the opposition said. Those killed on Friday including six people in Aleppo and two in Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. CNN could not confirm government or opposition claims about violence and casualties as Syria has severely restricted access for journalists. A Syrian government information minister said that ""terrorists"" -- which is how the Assad government refers to rebels -- cut the Internet service. But Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, a leading Web security firm, said the government is almost certainly responsible because of the outage pattern. Rebels have routinely used the Web to transmit images of the civil war. The uprising in Syria began in March 2011, largely inspired by Arab Spring protests that toppled hardline regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. Al-Assad's government responded by arresting, beating and shooting protesters, experts and witnesses said. The crackdown ignited a vicious armed conflict that has killed more than 40,000 civilians, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. More than 380,000 Syrians have fled the violence, the United Nations reports, to become refugees in neighboring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon. CNN's Chelsea J.

c693612fab3e7ea638515ce1c7e5adcc981228cd,CNN,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Steve Karas and Matthew Welling share a special bond. Matthew Welling, left, received a bone marrow transplant from Steve Karas, right. They aren't related. In fact, they had never even met until 3-year-old Matthew needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant two years ago. It turned out that Karas, 51, of Newton, Massachusetts, was a perfect match. ""My heart went a hundred miles an hour, and I couldn't even conceive of what this meant,"" Karas recalled. He had signed up for the National Marrow Donor Program registry 17 years ago and had never given it another thought. The call to donate came out of the blue. Karas remembered hearing, ""It was a little 1-year-old boy with this horrible disease called osteopetrosis, and the only cure was a bone marrow transplant, and would I be willing?"" He said there was no other answer than ""of course."" Karas is one of 11 million Americans who have volunteered to be marrow donors. Every day in the United States, an estimated 6,000 people need a transplant. There are two ways to donate bone marrow: Either a doctor must insert a needle into the back of the hip bone to retrieve the marrow, or cells are collected through a procedure called peripheral blood stem cell donation, or PBSC. ""Bone marrow is the source of early blood stem cells, and they make all kinds of blood cells that fight infection,"" said Dr. Ann Haight, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at the Aflac Cancer Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Bone marrow transplants can help treat cancers such as leukemia and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease. Matthew was suffering from a rare disorder that increases the density of bones and crowds out bone marrow.  Watch more on bone marrow donation » . His father, Michael, said waiting for doctors to find a donor match was terrifying. ""There is no more difficult, hard-to-stomach feeling than watching your child be sick and suffering and not be able to do anything,"" he said. Welling said his ailing son started turning the corner after receiving a transplant in November 2007. Doctors told him that Karas' bone marrow donation helped save Matthew's life by stopping the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, Matthew developed an infection a month after the transplant and the cells stopped working. He required a second transplant from another donor. That transplant worked, and while Matthew still suffers from side effects, his father reported the boy is cured of his initial disease. But the story doesn't end there. Karas' boss, Paul Amos, got word of his good deed and was so inspired that he launched a bone marrow registry drive among his 4,000 employees at Aflac, a supplemental insurance company based in Columbus, Georgia. As of Friday, nearly 1,100 workers had volunteered to join the national registry. ""We're not asking for money,"" Amos said. ""we're not asking for any additional time except for a couple of seconds on a coffee break. Think of all the things you've ever given, and that's the simplest you could ever give."" Joining the registry involves completing a donation kit (available at marrow.org). Cotton swabs are swiped on the inside of the cheeks to determine the tissue type. The sample is then sent along with an in-depth health history questionnaire to the National Marrow Donor Program. Dr. Haight said anyone over the age of 18 can join the registry provided he or she meets the health criteria. Those with conditions such as HIV, insulin-dependent diabetes, hepatitis and autoimmune diseases are generally excluded. ""The biggest need we have for additional donors is in racial and ethnic minorities,"" she said. ""That's because transplant tissue type will run with your racial and ethnic background. ... We need more African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics."" Karas found the actual harvest process to be relatively simple, with little pain. He ended up donating through the PBSC process, a nonsurgical outpatient procedure. The donor's blood is removed through an intravenous needle and passed through a machine that separates out blood-forming cells. The remaining blood is returned through a needle in the donor's other arm. ""I felt like I had the flu, and those symptoms lasted three or four days,"" he said. Karas went back to work as a sales coordinator at the Boston, Massachusetts, office of Aflac within days. About a year ago, he received another call out of the blue and was asked if he wanted to meet Matthew and his parents. Michael Welling said the reunion was filled with tears. ""There was a part of us that felt, 'I almost hope he thinks we were worthy of this unbelievable gift he gave us.' "" Karas reassured the family that there was never a doubt his mind, especially after seeing that Matthew was healthy and thriving. ""It was one of the most emotional moments of my life,"" Karas said. ""Short of fathering my own three sons, clearly this is the greatest thing I've ever been able to do.""",8,5.90838489257733
29579047f505f6d610b34707ab9bbd8274adb43f,CNN,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- At first glance, it looks like a standard road sign to Mecca, the Saudi Arabian pilgrimage site for millions of Muslims every year. But look again at this piece of graffiti art and you see that the Ka'ba, the cube-shaped building at the spiritual heart of Mecca shown on its genuine road signs, has been replaced by a cluster of high rise buildings. It is the work of Sarah Mohanna Al Abdali, a 22-year-old graphic design graduate, and she sprayed it on walls around her home city of Jeddah as a comment on overdevelopment in Mecca, the holiest Muslim city. It is a bold statement to make in the socially conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the method -- spray painting walls in public places -- even more so. ""At first I was worried about how the conservatives would react and whether I would get any bad comments, but no-one has said anything,"" said Al Abdali, who works as a university teaching assistant. ""Saudi is going through a lot of change and street art is the perfect medium to experiment in. Al Abdali began experimenting with graffiti about six months ago and is one of a small but growing number of street artists in the kingdom. A blog, Saudi Street Art, displays some of their work. ""It's something very new here,"" she said. ""I started with very random shapes but I wanted to develop more techniques that people could relate to. ""You don't see a lot of street art here, there's just vandalism. I'm excited to be doing something new. ""I like street art because it's there for the people. You don't need to overdo your ideas, it's a simple way of expressing yourself. And it's free, which you don't see in many forms of art."" Al Abdali sprayed her Mecca sign on walls around the historic area of Jeddah where it would be seen by as many passing people as possible. ""I didn't want it to be a beautiful artwork, I wanted to create debate,"" she said. She was pleased with the response it received. ""People took photos and shared them on Facebook and Twitter,"" she said. ""Some people related to it because it was straight to the point; other people didn't care. It's interesting to hear the different views every time someone comes up and asks me if I did it."" Al Abdali is also gaining recognition. She was one of four artists chosen to exhibit at an off shoot of the Edge of Arabia show, the first major contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia, according to its organizers. In a country where a lot of culture is controlled by the government, Al Abdali is one of growing number of young rebels finding their own way of pushing boundaries. Stand-up comedy is another art form gaining popularity just out of government reach. There are no comedy clubs and live shows are rare, but comedians are gaining a following through their own shows on YouTube. Omar Hussein hosts a satirical news show called ""On The Fly."" It goes out monthly on YouTube and episodes are watched online by hundreds of thousands of people. ""If we create our own entertainment, we preserve our culture,"" Hussein said. ""We are no longer reliant on culture that comes from abroad. ""We reflect something that's happening in our community in a comical manner and it's up to you to decide what's right and wrong."" While pushing gently at social boundaries -- such as women's rights -- the comedians say they self-censor, avoiding taboo topics like religion and the monarchy. Saudi Arabia is ruled by the Al Saud family, much of whose power to rule comes from its association with the Wahhabi religious establishment. Wahabism is an austere form of Islam that has been a major social and political force in the kingdom. ""If you self-censor, it's the best way to do this media that's accepted by our society, because our society, they want to be entertained but they don't want you to cross boundaries or taboos,"" said Hussein. ""We are not breaking anything. We are speaking, that's it,"" said fellow comedian Bader Saleh. ""There's stuff you can say without crossing any red lines."" Journalist and satirist Mohammad Bazaid, who launched his own satirical news show two years ago, says he wants to create debate you can't see elsewhere. ""The problem with traditional media is they tell you want to think about a certain issue,"" he said. ""I don't want to drag that with me into new media. I want people to look at a news headline and think twice about what it means."" But he too is wary. People have been arrested for work they post on social media. ""There's always a margin of concern,"" Bazaid added. ""We are always afraid, not of doing something wrong, but being understood in the wrong way."" One Saudi blogger, who asked not to be named, said young people find subtle ways around government control. ""A lot of cultural events are organized by the government, and the government puts a lot of restrictions on what can be done,"" he said. ""For culture to thrive, you need people who will push boundaries and that doesn't happen in a government-controlled environment."" He said that young people can go to gigs or live comedy, provided organizers promote them discreetly and avoid official attention. ""Often it's a gray area, where it's not quite legal but not totally secret. Invitations may go out on Facebook and instructions for how to buy tickets or where to go will be kept private until the day before.""",7,7.398982355722023
c1442cb5a6722c865c6bd421b7a28bcbecc0ce7a,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is back in the Middle East where he plans to propose a framework for a lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, saying the time is close for tough decision-making. Kerry arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday and immediately headed for Jerusalem, the start of his ninth trip to the region since taking over as America's top diplomat nearly a year ago. A senior State Department official said Kerry's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would be substantive. ""It is an effort to provide agreed guidelines for a permanent status agreement, that is to say, a full and final peace treaty between the parties,"" the official said. Kerry said in Jerusalem ""we know the parameters and the possibilities of peace"" after several months of discussions. He met with Netanyahu first, but the Israeli leader was not optimistic in brief public remarks. He expressed fresh doubts the Palestinians were committed to peace. ""I know that you are committed to peace. I know that I am committed to peace. But, unfortunately, given the actions and words of Palestinian leaders, there's growing doubt in Israel that the Palestinians are committed to peace,"" Netanyahu said in a speech at the start of his meeting with Kerry. During the remarks, Netanyahu accused Abbas of glorifying a group of Palestinian prisoners recently released by Israel. The release of the prisoners is part of a U.S.-backed deal to jump-start peace talks. Meanwhile, Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of sabotaging the talks with the announcement of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- areas that are considered key in any creation of a Palestinian state. With Mideast peace in mind, Kerry coaxes Israel on Iran . Kerry's proposal is based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. He intends to test them on some of the ideas resulting from those talks. The purpose of the trip is for Kerry to ""climb with the two leaders to the top of the hill and be able to share with them the view of what's on the other side, what peace will look like in terms of all of the core issues that have to be resolved between them,"" the official said. The hope is that it will be easier to finalize details once the shared vision is understood, the official added. But gaps remain, and the United States acknowledges that achieving the ultimate goal will not be easy as evidenced by recent actions by both sides. With direct negotiations between the two sides flailing, the Obama administration seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals instead of relying on the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate between themselves.

a228d589ae8e6a9251032f6d47de978ea283136e,CNN,"Rome (CNN) -- Amanda Knox again protested her innocence in the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher Tuesday, in a written statement to the Italian court hearing her retrial. In the statement, presented to the appeals court in Florence by Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, the American student insisted she had done nothing wrong. ""I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,"" Knox said. The retrial began in September without either Knox or her former boyfriend and fellow accused Raffaele Sollecito in court. Both have maintained their innocence. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read aloud Knox's statement Tuesday. In it, Knox said ""there is no scientific proof that puts me in the crime scene"" and that Kercher's killer had left enough traces behind for the court to be satisfied it was not her. ""It is impossible to identify and destroy genetic traces and leave others. I was not there,"" she said. Knox said that her behavior after Kercher's murder was discovered, when she could have left the country but instead stayed to help the investigation, also demonstrated she was not involved in the killing. She complained of her treatment by police, saying she had been lied to, threatened and hit by them. Knox also told the court that she had endured psychological pressure during her first murder trial, in 2009, because she was called many things. ""'I was called a wolf in sheep's clothing, a rapist, a thief, psychotic... Try to imagine your 20-year-old daughter being called all these things,"" she said. ""I am not psychotic. I don't have a split personality."" Knox's ex at retrial: Life has been a nightmare . Acquittal overturned . Sollecito and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Their convictions were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" But Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying that the jury that acquitted them didn't consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini last month said both Knox and Sollecito should be convicted and handed a 26-year sentence for homicide, with an additional four years for Knox for slander. Knox's lawyer called Tuesday for her ""acquittal verdict... to be confirmed."" A lawyer for Kercher's family, Francesco Maresca, gave his closing remarks Monday. ""No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,"" Maresca said. The defense for Sollecito may present its arguments next month. Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle after her acquittal and has been living there since. She says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars.

1c344989e1faaeb304bb0eca0c4d543883e089cc,CNN,"(CNN) -- Johnson and Johnson will partner with Massachusetts General Hospital to develop and market a blood test that could find a single cancer cell circulating in a person's blood, the company said Monday. Researchers hope the test will be used by oncologists as a diagnostic tool aimed at discovering as early as possible if a cancer has spread, as well as by researchers in coming up with new drug therapies. Dr. Mehmet Toner, director of the BioMicroElectroMechanical Systems Resource Center in Massachusetts General's Center for Engineering in Medicine, says while it will take at least five years before the test is on the market, it's another step toward personalized medicine and the implications for patients are significant. ""It is very big. It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer."" Toner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in ""solid"" organs like the breast or prostate. The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual. Veridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. ""This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,"" said Robert McCormack, Veridex's head of technology innovation and strategy. ""Harnessing the information contained in these cells in an in-vitro clinical setting could enable tools to help select treatment and monitor how patients are responding."" Veridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said. It describes circulating tumor cells as cancer cells that have detached from a tumor and are found at very low levels in the bloodstream. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said. ""The value of capturing and counting CTCs is evolving as more research data is gathered about the utility of these markers in monitoring disease progression and potentially guiding personalized cancer therapy,"" the Veridex statement said. Toner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs. ""The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,"" Toner said. ""We have developed and continue to develop a broad range of technologies that are evolving what we know about cancer and cancer care."" The American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting, but it's important to remember it's just another step in the scientific process. ""Researchers have been working on this and similar technologies for some time, and others have predicted a day when we will be able to diagnose cancers before they are otherwise visible by current techniques,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the group's deputy chief medical officer. ""It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm, but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer.""

72eb5a35a7fce863828b9fe8addcf08b431bf35a,CNN,"(CNN) -- What's in the coffee in Canada? Apparently something that's making a few folks pretty generous. At least six times this week, customers at Tim Hortons restaurants have paid for their own cups of coffee and cups of brew for the next 500 or more people in line, according to media reports. The first 500 free javas were gifts of an anonymous donor at a Tim Hortons in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on Monday, CTV reported. A man in his 20s bought a double-double and a doughnut and told the clerk to put the next 500 large coffees on his debit card, according to the report. ""(The staff was) thinking maybe he was so blessed that he wanted to share his blessing, or maybe he won the lotto or something,"" store manager Joanne Averion told CTV. The act has been repeated five times since, in Calgary, Alberta, on Tuesday, and in Red Deer, Alberta, and Ottawa on Thursday, and two more times again in Edmonton on Thursday, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The last case is the only one where the coffee donor has taken credit. Monica Kavanaugh bought 800 cups at the Tim Hortons in Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on Thursday. ""It's a way to give back,"" Kavanaugh told the CBC. ""They've (hospital staff) helped my father a lot, and I just feel, why not give a little back to the hospital?"" Earlier Thursday, someone paid for the next 500 cups at the hospital Hortons. It's all great business for Tim Hortons, but the company says it's serendipity, not a marketing stunt. ""As brilliant as this is, I can assure that Tim Hortons has nothing to do with the Good Samaritans that have been purchasing coffees across the country,"" Tim Hortons representative Michelle Robichaud told CTV. ""We're just as surprised and thrilled as our guests have been by these incredible random acts of kindness,"" the CBC quoted Robichaud as saying.

c716238aae2d911192fb74ee3b2a755f1958f35f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Watching CNN's town hall with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, I found the former secretary of state, senator, first lady and potential 2016 presidential candidate thoroughly enjoyable and at times even captivating and compelling. I sincerely appreciated the passion and clarity with which she addressed topics such as gun control (""A minority of people hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people""), marriage equality (""I'm very, very proud to state that I'm a full supporter of marriage equality right now"") and voting rights (""I deplore the efforts by some to restrict the right to vote""). And she was downright funny when she joked that she hadn't smoked pot yet and wasn't about to start anytime soon. But otherwise, as in most of her time in the public eye in general, Clinton was predictable and plain and, I'm sorry to say, kind of boring. Her answer on what to do about the millions of families who continue to be ripped apart by deportation was noncommittal. Clinton said that if Congress still continues to fail to pass comprehensive immigration reform, she would support ""more leeway and more discretion for the executive branch."" But Congress isn't passing reform any time soon, so real leadership on this issue now requires a more concrete -- and bold -- response. And then Clinton went on to mirror Republican talking points about border security and the need to ""send a clear"" message to would-be migrants, including children who ""should be sent back."" Clinton was carefully trying to echo immigrant-rights sentiments while toeing a conservative line on policy -- the opposite of bold leadership. When the question of Benghazi came up, Clinton carefully defended herself to such an extent that she almost seemed to be reading a script. What she didn't do was use the opportunity to go after those who continue to politicize Benghazi to try to damage her potential candidacy. In fact, she even gave their ongoing concerns credence in suggesting she still has questions about what happened that night -- this despite dozens of hearings and briefings and millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in political fishing expeditions. Again, Clinton walked the safe and predictable line here but definitely not one interesting to voters looking for decisive closure on Benghazi, or for those of us in the chattering class. I confess I already have a chip on my shoulder about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency. She is far too centrist on economic issues and hawkish on foreign policy, not only for my personal taste but arguably for the majority of American voters today. At a time when most Americans still want Wall Street held accountable for crashing our economy, President Hillary Clinton would likely be cozier with big banks than Barack Obama has been. And at a time when the majority of Americans are strongly regretful about the Iraq War -- and are deeply wary of another one -- it's worth remembering that Clinton voted for the war, even if she did later change her mind. Even as tea party-ish Republicans are thumping the drums of economic populism, Clinton is literally and figuratively the candidate of the establishment. Of course I think Clinton would be better for America than any number of Republican alternatives. I'll take pro-corporate, mushy centrism over pro-corporate, right-wing extremism any day. But that doesn't mean I'm excited. When it comes to economic and social policy, Clinton is no passionate, populist progressive. Fine, so at the very least I'd like to be wowed by rhetoric. That's what Obama did. I didn't like his centrist record and policy agenda either, but I'll admit I was dazzled by the way he wrapped his mushy Democratic status quo-ness in lofty ideals and imagery. For us progressives, national elections generally require settling for the lesser of two evils. At least Obama made us rhetorically feel we were voting for something different. We hoped for change, even if we deep down knew we wouldn't get it. In what was presumably a dig at Obama, Clinton said during the CNN town hall, ""Some people can paint a beautiful vision. And, thankfully, we can all learn from that, but then, can you -- with the tenacity, the persistence, the getting-knocked-down/getting-back-up resilience -- can you lead us there?"" The implication is that she is no beautiful vision painter, she's the get-er-done-er -- batting cleanup on the unfinished business of Obama and to an extent Bill Clinton as well. And while I genuinely suspect that with her longer exposure to the slings and arrows of right-wing political attacks and both the thicker skin and bare-knuckle tactics she has developed in response, Hillary Clinton might indeed be able to get more done than Obama, even when faced with the same utterly unfathomable and childish Republican intransigence, I just can't get excited. But at the end of the day, that lack of excitement may be Clinton's best asset if she chooses to run. After all, we live in a 24/7 scandal cycle where political candidates flame out with one misstep of a tweet. (And some would agree with Jessica Valenti that Clinton has no choice but to be boring, given that ""any emotion that Hillary Clinton shows has always been used against her, and it has become a kind of stand-in for the many reasons women are said to be oh-so-unfit to lead."") Opinion: What Clinton doesn't get on immigration . The downside to Clinton being so careful and calculated is also an upside; she's not likely to make any serious mistakes anytime soon. And while political leaders who make bullheaded (and factually misleading) arguments that lead our country to war or those who stand firmly and consistently on the other side are certainly more exciting, we need more leaders who are willing to see both sides of an argument and occasionally admit when they're wrong -- as Clinton did on Iraq. Not exciting but refreshing and important. And certainly, given the inability of Republicans to identify a front-runner at this point, let alone their track record of producing an astonishing rate of disqualifying gaffes, simply by not rocking the boat, Clinton may sail into the White House. Inevitability is boring, but who cares if it works? What was exciting about the CNN town hall was the format, the superb moderating by Christiane Amanpour, the probing questions from the diverse audience, the online interaction via Tumblr and the opportunity for ordinary Americans directly to engage a historic figure on live, national television. What wasn't exciting was Clinton. But who needs exciting when you get to be president?",3,10.01719078695524

But a few hours later, when a persistent ringing phone woke her up in the dead of the August night, the 55-year-old found out she was much more than simply a secretary. At the other end of the line was Bartels's cousin, from Otuam, a small fishing village on the coast of Ghana. Excited and humble, he congratulated her on being the new king of Otuam. ""I said, 'listen, it's 4 o'clock in the morning in the U.S., I am very tired, let me sleep,'"" remembers Bartels. ""I thought he was trying to really play games with me."" But this was no time for games. The previous king of Otuam, who was Bartels's uncle, had just died. The village elders, who remembered Bartels from the times she'd visited with her mother, had decided to anoint her as their new ruler. Watch video: King Peggy shows off her crowns . After the initial shock, Bartels decided to accept the kingship. Over the course of a few days, she went from being plain old Peggielene Bartels, who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, to becoming King Peggy -- the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people. ""It never ever occurred to me [that I'd be Otuam's king],"" says Bartels, who's been living in the United States since her early 20s. ""I realized that on this earth, we all have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it because helping my people has really helped me a lot to know that I can really touch their lives,"" she adds. ""I would have really regretted it if I hadn't really accept this calling."" Although she still works at the Ghanaian Embassy, Bartels uses all her holiday every year to spend a month in Otuam. King is the traditional title of Otuam's ruler, and Bartels says she's happy to be called a king, rather than queen, because it means she can achieve more. ""Most of the time, a king is the one who has all the executive power to do things, while the queen is mostly in charge of the children's affairs and reporting to the king,"" she says. ""So I really love this."" Read more: The Lady King of Otuam . King Peggy was born in Takoradi, southern Ghana, in 1953. She studied in England before moving to the United States, where she became an American citizen in 1997. But after inheriting the throne, Bartels has been living two very different lives in two different continents. In Washington, her secretarial duties include typing letters, answering phone calls and booking appointments. In her little apartment her life is far removed from the luxuries of her royal roots. ""When I am in the United States I do everything by myself,"" she explains. ""I do my own laundry, I do my own cooking, I do my own driving and I do my own bed when I wake up in the morning."" Read more: Secretary is still the top job for women . But back in Ghana, she stands out as a gold crown-wearing, scepter-holding king who lives in a refurbished palace. Otuam residents usually address her as ""Nana"" -- an honorary title given to royalty but also to women with grandchildren -- and bow when they see her. ""When I am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me,"" she says. ""They have to cook for me, they have to carry me around and they have to protect me from people. They want to do everything for me which I usually refuse ... Sometimes I say to them 'please, don't bow.' I just want them to be free and comfortable so that way we can really address issues."" In pictures: Africa's power women . But beyond the bows, the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title, being a king in an impoverished place like Otuam is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people, says Bartels. ""To be a king in an African village or some places like this, it's not like European queens where everything is on a silver platter for them,"" she says. ""I have to really work hard to help my people. I have to give myself to people to better their lives."" In the last few years, she's helped poor families pay school fees for their children and brought computers to classrooms. With the help of other Americans she's also provided Otuam with its first ambulance, as well as access to clean, running water. Her next priority, she says, is to bring state-of-the-art toilets to Otuam. And even when she's not in Ghana, her royal duties do not stop; she wakes up at 1am every morning to call Otuam and be informed about what's happening in the community. ""I talk to my regent, I talk to my elders,"" Bartels says. ""If there is something that I want to know, they tell me. If there is something that I want them to do, I tell them."" Last year, King Peggy's real-life fairy tale was documented in a book written by her and author Eleanor Herman. And now she says her amazing life journey from secretary to king will be told in a film, after Hollywood star Will Smith bought the rights to the book. ""Next year, God willing, we are going to have a movie out there,"" says King Peggy. ""Queen Latifah is going to play me and I'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people.""",1,10.056951700068685
101742e883ac0ed5bccb35692c10310a3f107505,CNN,"(CNN) -- Most Americans think of the Arctic as an icy, distant place; beautiful, remote and teeming with wildlife, but unrelated to their daily lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. This summer, big doings on America's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic, strategic and environmental future of the nation. Yet we are unprepared for the challenges and opportunities. What happens in the Arctic as ice melts there could soon cheapen the cost of the gas you buy and products you purchase from Asia. It could help make the nation more energy independent. It could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory. It is already challenging Washington to protect millions of square miles filled with some of the most magnificent wildlife on Earth, and native people whose culture and way of life is at risk as a squall line of development sweeps across the once inaccessible top of the planet. Opinion: It's time to develop our Arctic resources . For America, the stakes are huge: A chance to gain wealth and global influence in the newest geopolitical playing field, but there is also potential environmental and security disaster if looming challenges are mishandled or ignored. If that sounds farfetched, consider the following: . -- Shell is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of Alaska in a few weeks. The operation will assess whether an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil is there. This is roughly three times the amount that has been extracted from the Gulf of Mexico over the past 20 years. Shell Oil ship slips anchor; incident raises questions about Arctic drilling plan . Proponents believe a discovery would cut America's dependence on foreign oil and provide jobs and needed revenue to the Treasury Department. They say the oil could be extracted safely. Opponents fear a spill would be a disaster, being difficult to clean up in icy seas. More oil companies wait in the wings and also own offshore leases. -- In Washington, politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify ""The Law of the Sea Treaty,"" under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves. For the U.S., that could mean extra territory the size of California off Alaska. President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush support the treaty, as does an oddly aligned group including the Pentagon, Sierra Club, oil companies, shipping companies and environmentalists, who favor the part of the treaty designed to help protect the world's oceans. Although every other Arctic country has ratified the treaty, in the U.S. it has been blocked for years by conservative senators who fear that it gives too much influence to multinational bodies. -- An undersea land rush has started under the treaty, with Russia claiming an area the size of France and Spain combined. Norway's claim has been granted, and other Arctic nations preparing to file claims. One U.S. Coast Guard admiral, speaking of the treaty, told me, ""If this was a ball game, the U.S. wouldn't be on the field, in the stadium or even in the parking lot. We're last in this race."" -- The Russian military has identified the Arctic as one of the likely places for conflict to erupt in the 21st century over resources. Even if actual combat never occurs, whoever controls the high north will wield enormous influence in the coming decades. Russia has 18 working icebreakers. The U.S. has one. Russia is opening their Arctic sea lanes to commercial shipping. The U.S. has no permanent Coast Guard or Naval presence yet in the high north, although both branches of the service are preparing to move north. Naval war games last fall anticipated security challenges in the near future: how to deal with terrorists in the Arctic, how to deal with a rogue ship carrying nuclear weapons in the Arctic, how to move a U.S. fleet around the top of the planet, how to help clean up an oil spill. Gamers concluded the Navy needs to prepare and needs more resources. -- The Northwest Passage is the long-dreamed-of, formerly iced-over sea route between Europe and Asia. This route around the top of Canada and Alaska has killed hundreds of sailors and explorers for centuries, locking their ships in ice, starving them, freezing them, driving them insane and causing survivors to eat each other. Yet in summers, that passage is now so clear that tourist ships routinely sail through it. Even private yachts make the trip. It is expected that commercial shipping will follow. That's because a single Chinese container ship sailing the Northwest Passage between Shanghai and New York instead of using the Panama Canal would save an estimated $2 million each way on gas and tolls. In short, the region is opening. For the past three years, I've spent much time in northern Alaska researching for my book, ""The Eskimo and the Oil Man."" It's about the grand challenges facing the world there, as seen through the eyes of an Inupiat Eskimo leader who is a grandfather and whale hunter, and the Shell executive sent to drill for oil off Alaska's North Slope. I sailed on the only U.S. icebreaker for six weeks, sat in on meetings at the Senate over the Arctic, attended a naval war game and met regularly with other oil executives and Inupiat leaders, whale hunters and families on the North Slope. That 4,000-year-old culture sits at the border between wise development and environmental anarchy, and the people of America's polar county will soon watch with hope and fear as the oil ships move north. Their concerns are not just local ones but should engage every American. If you care about the environment, if you care about gas prices, if you care about where our soldiers and navy may serve next, if you want the U.S. to remain strong and dominant in the world, look to the north this summer. Look to the Arctic. That's where much of our common future is about to play out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Reiss.",2,12.316396564410114
d1a2f17b67bcd1d6af8317beee722200769aecc8,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""Why did you turn off the RV?"" Alyssa Padgett recalls asking her husband, Heath, as their 29-foot RV careened off an exit toward the small town of Williams, Arizona. ""I didn't,"" he replied. Just 10 days into their cross-country honeymoon, the fuel pump in their camper, lovingly known as ""Franklin,"" malfunctioned. Then came the propane leak, the broken refrigerator, the leaking roof and the fender bender in an Oregon parking lot, to name just a few of the couple's bumps in the road. It's all part of the ""grand adventure"" the 23-year-old newlyweds from Texas were looking for when they set out on June 1 for a seven-month, 50-state road trip -- and an extended honeymoon. As their May 24 wedding date approached earlier this year, the pair decided it was an opportune time to do a little soul-searching together. ""We've lived in Texas our whole lives, 22 summers,"" Alyssa says. ""We wanted to go on this grand adventure and figure out where we wanted to live. We figured why don't we just do all of it at once?"" The couple says the plan quickly escalated from ""let's just move to California"" to ""let's make a documentary about finding meaning in your work,"" an issue with which they both were struggling. Both of them had always wanted to pursue a career in writing outside the day jobs they had settled into, but had never quite figured out how to translate their hobby into a dream career. So the couple quit their jobs -- Alyssa at a nonprofit and Heath in software sales -- and came up with the Griswolds-inspired scheme. ""When I told my parents, Heath wasn't there ... for his safety,"" Alyssa jokes. As a young couple just getting on their feet, the next hardest part was figuring out how to make ends meet on the road. Heath, with a little entrepreneurial know-how, contacted Snagajob.com, an hourly employment marketplace, to help find hourly workers (which made up 58.8% of the American workforce in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to spotlight during their travels. With a Wi-Fi router and a new video camera in tow, ""Hourly America,"" was born, where he spends one day shadowing an hourly worker in each state, whether working at a yoga studio in Connecticut, a farm in Wisconsin or a bakery in Wyoming. Before they left, the Padgetts mapped out their route meticulously, and it now hangs above their bed so they can track their progress. They are saving Alaska and Hawaii for last and will visit them by plane (driving a rickety RV to Alaska in wintertime is not recommended, apparently). In lieu of wedding gifts, the couple asked family and friends to donate to their GoFundMe crowdfunding site. But because of a slew of mechanical problems with the RV, the money was gone within the first month. ""We knew we've got to get smart really fast,"" Alyssa says. The couple doesn't get paid for their hourly jobs that are part of the documentary. Instead, they supplement their income with freelance writing on various RV renovation and life-on-the-road websites. ""The RV industry is kind of fascinated by us,"" Alyssa says, as millennials are an unconventional demographic for the RV crowd. Speaking of unconventional, so was choosing to spend their honeymoon in an RV instead of an exotic beach somewhere. ""It's sometimes difficult to balance the chaos of life on the road with spending quality time together, but we chose this honeymoon knowing it wasn't going to be traditional,"" Heath says. ""We work a lot, but we work side by side. It's not exactly sipping mimosas on the beach, but we love every minute."" The couple planned a ""honeymoon within the honeymoon"" -- a weeklong drive along the Pacific Coast Highway -- to share a little of that newlywed bliss. They'll roll back into Texas on Christmas, as their families requested, with a video and web journal of their journey plus a full ""blessings book,"" as they call it. ""We started it as a way to keep optimistic,"" Heath says. Like that night in Arizona when they broke down. They went into a nearby restaurant for a drink and a bowl of queso -- as one needs in those desperate times -- and met a couple, Jimmy and Karen, who teach martial arts in the small town. Their new friends bought them a beer and let them take a free class to work out some of that road stress. Alyssa and Heath say it's little things like that -- and parking in someone's driveway for free or watching a Dallas Cowboys game with new pals in a neighboring RV -- that keeps them going.",5,8.206799564478075
520a5e4463504c594daa582729da42ef403082dd,CNN,"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's Parliament began casting votes Thursday for a new president to take the place of the incumbent Giorgio Napolitano, whose term expires next month. The election of a new president could be the first step toward solving a political impasse that has gripped Italy since February's general election left a three-way split between the right, the left and a wild-card party. The presidential voting process is open to 1,007 elected representatives: the 630 deputies in the lower house, 315 senators plus four senators-for-life, and 58 regional delegates. The secret ballot is taking place inside the Chamber of Deputies, or lower house of Parliament. Usually the senators vote first, then the deputies, then the regional delegates. They can vote for any citizen over 50 with full civil and political rights. After counting for the first round wrapped up, former trade union leader Franco Marini was in the lead with 521 votes but short of the two-thirds majority, or 672 votes, needed to win the presidency. The center-left coalition led by politician Pier Luigi Bersani and the center-right coalition of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi appeared to be coming together to back Marini. This would indicate a degree of cooperation between the two blocs, which might allow some kind of alliance to be formed. In second place was Stefano Rodota, a former Italian Communist Party lawmaker and law professor, with 240 votes. Former Turin Mayor Sergio Chiamparino received 41 votes. Berlusconi's ex-wife, Veronica lario, received one vote, despite expressing no desire to be president. According to the Italian Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the electors is needed in the first three rounds of voting. From the fourth session onward, the bar is lowered to an absolute majority, equal to 504 votes. A second round of voting will take place later Thursday. Napolitano's seven-year term expires on May 15. While the Italian presidency is largely a ceremonial role, it can become a critical one in times of political crisis. The issue has been that, under the constitution, the Italian president cannot dissolve Parliament and call for new elections in the last six months of his mandate. The election of a new president could help move Italy out of its current political gridlock. Bersani fared the best in the February elections by leading a leftist coalition dominated by his Democratic Party to a small majority in the lower house of Parliament, but has been unable to form a government. Power in the Senate, where it counts, was divided between Bersani and Berlusconi's center-right coalition, anchored by his party, Popolo della Liberta, or People of Freedom. Bersani and Berlusconi are archrivals who have previously indicated they will not work together. The wild-card party of Beppe Grillo, the grass-roots Five-Star Movement, will also not enter into an alliance. CNN's Hada Messia and Ben Wedeman reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London.",7,10.478312645068625
d153846131678248815eeb5c05f0a26e9c2e0fe6,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Tests on the ruptured BP well in the Gulf of Mexico will go on for another 24 hours as federal and company officials try to explain ""anomalous"" pressure readings and possible leaks, the federal government's point man on the spill said Monday. ""There is no indication at this time this is any indication of a significant problem in the well bore, but we are running every one of these anomalies down,"" former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told reporters Monday afternoon. The pressures recorded on the well in the four days since it was temporarily ""shut in"" are lower than expected, Allen said. Meanwhile, there are possible leaks of methane gas from around the well and from the inoperative blowout preventer, as well as a separate and possibly unrelated seep from the ocean floor about 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) away, he said. Allen said scientists and engineers are still debating whether the low pressure is caused by either the well's depletion after three months of oil spewing into the Gulf or whether oil is leaking from the well into the surrounding sea floor. ""There are arguments to be made on both sides,"" he said. ""But those discussions continue, and we're trying to develop information that will allow us to do that."" He said a joint in the capping stack placed over the damaged well appeared to be leaking a combination of oil and methane, but there appeared to be no sign that it was hindering the equipment now being used to contain the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Some seepage from the ocean floor is normal in the Gulf of Mexico, according to University of Houston professor Don Van Nieuwenhuise. But he said there are weak points in the well bore, and it's ""very hard to tell the difference"" between a depleted well and a leaking well. ""If there is a leak, you should be able to see the oil and gas infiltrating into a rock unit at about that level, and they have not seen that,"" he said. Allen had extended testing Sunday as well, pointing out ""a number of unanswered questions"" about the monitoring systems being used to conduct the tests. Earlier Monday, he said the tests would continue only if BP was ""rigorously"" watching for any signs that the pressure tests could make the situation worse. Engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well, poring over images and data collected by robots, sonar scans, and seismic and acoustic examinations. A government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. ""At any moment, we have the ability to return to the safe containment of the oil on the surface until the time the relief well is completed and the well is permanently killed,"" Allen said. In the coming weeks, BP also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two in the Gulf, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, Allen's deputy on the scene, said the Helix Producer and the Q4000, two of the ships disconnected from the well to put on the containment cap, could be quickly re-connected within hours if scientists decide that's necessary. In addition, BP also plans to conduct tests known as ranging runs on one of its relief wells, which company officials have said could intersect the ruptured well by the end of July and provide the permanent solution to the leak. BP then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well. Pressure continues to rise steadily at about 1 pound PSI per hour and was about 6,811 pounds Monday evening, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells told reporters. Wells said gas bubbles reported coming from the well casing could be nitrogen used in the well's cementing process, but others near the well head contained about 15 percent methane. A breach in the casing would be signaled by a drop in pressure or possibly the release of methane gas, which is sometimes a precursor to oil rising through the formation, he said. Continuing with the testing is ""absolutely the best way for us to go forward,"" Wells said. The well, located about 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf and about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River, erupted April 20 with the sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. No oil has gushed out since Thursday, when BP closed all the valves in a new custom-made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week. That lull in oil flow has jump-started the federal claims process. Kenneth Feinberg, the man in charge of disbursing the $20 billion in funds BP is setting aside to resolve Gulf oil spill-related claims, said Monday that now that the oil leak has apparently been stopped, it will be a lot easier and quicker to get a handle on the universal claims. At a question-and-answer discussion in Washington, Feinberg said it has been difficult to come up with a budget because officials did not know how pervasive the spill would become. ""Now that the oil has stopped, with my fingers crossed, we will quickly come up with an overall budget,"" he said. Feinberg said the fund was being established by BP with the support of the Obama administration as an alternative to years of protracted litigation, and said the challenge is to make the reparations process attractive enough so people will voluntarily seek compensation from it.

b3e1d291e1fb8a969cbec87360dca9e12cc1a36a,CNN,"(CNN) -- After nearly 10 years of expertly skewering American pop culture and the television wasteland, E!'s clip show ""The Soup"" is raising the stakes on its own program and will broadcast live for the first time to mark the series' 500th episode. The show will air live on both coasts on August 21 at 10 p.m. At a recent taping for the 499th episode, host Joel McHale and executive producer K.P. Anderson spoke with reporters about the milestone and what Anderson called the ""high-wire effect"" of the live show. ""I have full-on dyslexia,"" McHale said. ""So that'll be great. I think it really brings a sense of danger."" The 500th show will be a ""Soup"" fans recognize, rather than a retrospective. ""I think live is pretty much the trick,"" Anderson said. ""We'll have a couple of little surprises along the way with our special guests, but I think we as a show do better when the material is fresh and we have new jokes."" As of the interview, the special guests -- a different set for each coast -- include B.J. Novak, Adam Carolla and perhaps Lady Gaga. (She was still pending.) McHale said he prefers a good mix. ""It's like getting a Blizzard at Dairy Queen,"" he quipped. As for dream guests in the future, he named Paul McCartney, Beyonce and Jay Z, Justin Bieber because ""apparently he has a fan base,"" David Byrne from Talking Heads and Prince. ""I would love for Prince (to come on),"" McHale said. ""Prince, open invitation."" And why not? McHale said most guests enjoy their experience. ""Without exception,"" he said, ""every single reality star I have ever met has said, 'Please put me on your show' or 'Thank you for having me on your show and may I come back on?' No one has gone, 'How dare you?' "" Still, the host admitted he never thought ""The Soup"" would last. ""We have a 50-year plan,"" he joked. ""This is phase one. It's complete. Phase two is the next 10 years."" But seriously, ""I never thought it would go this long. No one ever thought that. ""There was always the sense, especially in the first couple of years, that no one was watching, kind of like public access. And that sense that people still aren't watching has never left."" ""The TV landscape has changed over the time that we've been doing (the show),"" Anderson said. ""We''ve talked about how we're going to change things because 'Pawn Stars' became more popular than the scream-at-each-other-and-puke-in-the-foyer-shows"" that were the show's bread and butter early on. ""The success (of 'The Soup') is we take all of the mayhem that exists out there and bring it under one roof. But what that is changes all the time."" Currently the show's staff is obsessed with ""Whodunnit?"" the goofy murder mystery show on ABC. ""The clips aren't necessarily the most provocative, but the show has been driving the staff out of its mind all summer. There are zero stakes. There's no tension,"" he said. ""And we love it."" Though it's hard to remember most of the clips the show has churned through over the 500 episodes, some, like Whitney Houston on ""Being Bobby Brown"" and Tila Tequila on ""Shot at Love,"" naturally stand out. But it's ""Spaghetti Cat"" that McHale calls ""the greatest moment we ever had."" When McHale is not taping ""The Soup,"" he's busy filming movies and starring on NBC's ""Community."" The show's fifth season features the return of ""Community"" creator Dan Harmon, and while McHale modestly underplayed his role in getting Harmon back, it has been said he was instrumental. ""(Harmon) created the show and the show is in his voice, so to have it back in his voice I think was important,"" McHale told CNN. ""I was thrilled that he wanted to come back and that Sony was willing to have him back, so I've never been creatively happier.""",6,9.401711703316257

52fefb7cb7add7ed84ab7fd8872af9f91811948c,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In one of the shortest session in its history, the Senate's final session of the year lasted a total of 12 seconds Monday. Democrats kept the Senate in session over the holiday season. Only one senator, Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, was in the chamber to gavel open the Senate and adjourn it until January 3. Monday's event was the latest in a series of ""pro forma"" sessions the Senate has called. Pro forma means ""for the sake of formality"" and these micro sessions are part of the last political scuffle between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress. Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments. During congressional recesses, a constitutional mechanism allows the president to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday nearly a week and a half ago, but only one senator is needed to keep the Senate in session. During the session last week, Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. Wednesday's session lasted for 11 seconds. In all, he spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of pro forma sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects. Similar sessions were conducted over the Thanksgiving recess. Other Democrats -- including Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York -- will share the duty of presiding over the ""pro forma"" sessions next month.

75316e6f6c09aa76dc1ad4bbc17c1c7ad605d775,CNN,"(CNN) -- Two Iranians were convicted in a Bangkok court Thursday over a botched bomb plot last year that resulted in one losing both of his legs as he hurled an explosive device while trying to escape arrest. Saied Moradi, 29, was found guilty of attempted murder, causing explosions and violating gun laws, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, Thai police spokesman Phanom Chuathong told CNN. Muhammad Khazaei, 43, was sentenced to 15 years jail for causing explosions and causing damage to public and private property. Israel has maintained the explosives were part of a plot aimed at assassinating Israeli diplomats in Bangkok â€” a claim Tehran has refuted. Both men -- who were charged with criminal rather than terrorism offenses -- denied any involvement in a plot, saying they were unaware of explosives in their home. The court also demanded the two men pay reparations valued at around 2 million baht ($62,300) to compensate for the damage caused. Thai authorities said five suspects escaped from a villa in the Thai capital following the blast, two of whom are still on the run. Moradi was injured when he detonated two bombs -- one when a taxi driver refused to give him a ride and another when he tried to throw a bomb at police officers as they closed in on him. The court heard that Khazaei ran out of the house after the first explosion and headed to the airport where police arrested him at the boarding gate. A third man, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, managed to board a plane to Malaysia. Chuathong told CNN the court ruling would ""certainly have an impact on the High Court of Malaysia's decision on the extradition request from Bangkok."" Zadeh has been in custody in Malaysia since last year, pending a High Court decision on his extradition to Thailand. At the time of the blasts, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Iran is a threat to the stability of the world. They are targeting innocent diplomats. ""The international community has to denounce the Iranian actions and to indicate red lines concerning the Iranian aggression."" Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, responded by condemning the blasts on Iran's state-run Press TV in an article on its website, but added: ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts.""",1,7.91891619085889
b5aa6666f3b9fb940de835cc3014146b0d276401,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- A federal court challenge to a new Arizona law aimed at curbing illegal immigration isn't out of the question, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday. Holder said that the Justice Department was working with the Department of Homeland Security to ""decide exactly how we are going to react to it."" ""We are considering all possibilities, including the possibility of a court challenge,"" Holder told reporters during questions at a news conference, at which he had announced a settlement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over its marketing of an anti-psychotic drug. ""I think that [Arizona's] law is an unfortunate one,"" he said. ""I think that it is, I fear, subject to potential abuse. And I'm very concerned about the wedge that it could draw between communities that law enforcement is supposed to serve and those of us in law enforcement. "" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who served as Arizona's governor until she took the position with the Obama administration, told a Senate panel Tuesday that she has ""deep concerns"" with the law. Napolitano said she fears it would siphon away resources that would otherwise be used to pursue individuals who commit major crimes while in the country illegally. ""I think these kinds of laws are not value-added to law enforcement,"" she told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""There's a reason most law enforcement groups ... oppose them."" They put an ""undue barrier"" between victims of crime and law enforcement officials, she said. Napolitano, who served as Arizona's governor before joining President Obama's Cabinet, refused to offer an opinion on the constitutionality of the law. The new law requires Arizona police to determine whether people are in the United States legally if there is a reason to suspect they aren't. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed the controversial legislation into law Friday. Supporters say it is needed to control illegal immigration. The law, scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state's legislative session, would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times. Currently, officers can check someone's immigration status only if that person is suspected in another crime. Critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses, conventions and tourists to stay away from the state. The bill has prompted rallies by opponents and supporters, and some prominent politicians in Washington and Arizona have criticized the measure. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, a Democrat, has said he'll file a lawsuit to block the law. Last week, Obama called the legislation ""misguided"" and said the federal government must act on the immigration issue. ""Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe,"" he said. Napolitano told the Judiciary Committee members that the ""passage of laws like [Arizona's] at the state level indicate the need to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform."" But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, blamed federal authorities for undermining the push for comprehensive immigration reform by failing to more effectively secure the Mexican border. ""Our borders are broken ... [and] there's a war going on"" with drug cartels in Mexico that is spilling over into the United States, he argued. ""Good people are so afraid of an out-of-control border that they had to resort to a law [in Arizona] that I think is unconstitutional,"" he said. The federal government has to prove ""that we can secure our borders"" before Congress can pass an immigration reform bill. Over the weekend, Graham withdrew his support for what had been a bipartisan plan to pass climate change legislation because, he claimed, Democrats were trying to ram through a polarizing immigration reform bill. Some political observers have said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is trying to push a reform plan in order to boost his standing among Hispanic voters and bolster his re-election prospects in November. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, acknowledged Tuesday that congressional Democrats are divided over how to proceed with an immigration reform bill. He also said House members are expecting the Senate to take the lead in crafting a proposal. ""In part, of course, what the people of Arizona are saying is that the feds haven't done their job. I think they're right,"" he said. But Hoyer criticized the new state law, arguing that it is ""very inconsistent with past practices in America. ... We don't go around asking people for I.D. cards."" He said it is ""very difficult to see how that's going to be carried out in a way that's consistent with the civil liberties of citizens."" Napolitano acknowledged that more work has to be done along the southern border, but she also expressed frustration with GOP arguments on border security. She claimed that the overall situation has improved and questioned whether the goal of ""securing the border"" could ever be fully reached. Napolitano declined to provide a direct answer when asked whether the Arizona law could negatively impact race relations. But ""if this law goes into effect,"" she warned, ""there are a lot of questions about what the real impact on the street will be.""

00f23c2ac2d8a4d208be808f6b5ed5077d5a274d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Five more Georgia men were charged in connection with an anti-government militia with ties to Fort Stewart that's been accused of killing two people and plotting to assassinate President Barack Obama, authorities said Tuesday. The five defendants were indicted in Liberty County, Georgia, on charges that include violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, involving what prosecutors called an ""identified criminal street gang"" named FEAR, for Forever Enduring, Always Ready. Four U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Stewart had already been accused of being members of the anarchist group, which was allegedly stockpiling weapons and bomb parts to overthrow the U.S. government, prosecutors said. The four soldiers are accused of killing former GI Michael Roark and his teenage girlfriend, Tiffany York. 'Anarchists' accused of murder; broader plot against government . Under one of three indictments returned Monday by a Liberty County grand jury, Christopher Jenderseck was charged with three Street Gang Act violations and two counts of tampering with evidence in the killings of Roark and York in neighboring Long County, said District Attorney Tom Durden and Assistant District Attorney Isabel Pauley of the Atlantic Judicial Circuit. In a second indictment, defendant Timothy Martin Joiner is charged with burglary, theft by taking and two Street Gang Act violations. Adam Dearman is charged with three Street Gang Act offenses. In the third indictment, Joiner, Adam Dearman, Randall Blake Dearman and Anthony Garner are charged jointly, prosecutors said. Joiner and Randall Dearman each face two counts of burglary, nine counts of entering an auto, two counts of financial transaction card theft, one count of theft by taking, one count of criminal damage to property in the second degree, and 14 counts of Street Gang Act violations, prosecutors said. In addition, Adam Dearman is indicted on three counts of Street Gang Act violations, and Garner is charged with theft by receiving stolen property and one Street Gang Act count, prosecutors said. Jenderseck was arrested Tuesday in North Dakota, but Joiner and Garner weren't in custody, authorities said Tuesday. Regarding the charges against the four soldiers, a law enforcement official said they had legally purchased at least 18 rifles and handguns in Washington and Georgia. Uncompleted pipe bombs were also found, and were comprised of store-bought materials, the official said. No sophisticated military grade-explosives were involved in their construction. One official described the offenses as a murder case and said no federal charges had been filed. Last month, Pfc. Michael Burnett laid out the elaborate plot, telling a southeast Georgia court that he was part of what prosecutors called ""an anarchist group and militia."" Dressed in his Army uniform, he spoke in a Long County court about the group of Army soldiers and its role in the December deaths of Roark and York. Roark, he said, was killed because he took money from the group and planned to leave. ""I don't know how it got to the point where two people got murdered,"" Burnett said in court. He talked about how he and three others accused -- Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, Sgt. Anthony Peden and Pvt. Christopher Salmon -- had begun getting together, ""just going out shooting guns, just guy stuff."" ""And then Aguigui introduced me to 'the manuscript,' that's what he called it, a book about true patriots,"" the soldier said. The four men became part of a group that aimed ""to give the government back to the people,"" according to Burnett, who said that revolution was its goal. They called it FEAR -- Forever Enduring Always Ready -- and spent thousands of dollars buying guns and bomb parts. Prosecutors: 'Anarchist' group of U.S. soldiers aimed to overthrow government . The government needed a change, Burnett told the court. ""I thought we were the people who would be able to change it."" It is not clear how capable the group was of carrying out the goals Burnett laid out. Assistant District Attorney Pauley identified Aguigui as the leader of what she described as ""an anarchist group and militia"" that included active and former troops. ""Defendant Aguigui actively recruited new members at Fort Stewart (in southeast Georgia) and targeted soldiers who were in trouble or disillusioned,"" she said. At the time of their arrest, group members had plotted a number of ""acts of domestic terror,"" the prosecutor said. These included ""forcibly taking over the ammo control point of Fort Stewart to take the post, bombing vehicles of local and state judicial and political figureheads and federal representatives to include the local department of homeland security, (and plotting) to bomb the fountain at Forsyth Park in Savannah."" Days before he died, Roark had been discharged from the Army, according to Pauley. Roark and his girlfriend were killed because Aguigui felt the couple was ""a loose end,"" Burnett said. Burnett admitted being at the scene of the crime, including watching as a soldier ""checked (York's) pulse and then shot her again."" As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Burnett pleaded guilty to manslaughter -- instead of murder, thus avoiding a possible death sentence -- and other charges. He also agreed to testify against the three other soldiers accused in the case. All four soldiers had also been charged by the military in connection with the two killings. But as their case proceeded through civilian courts, the Army dismissed its charges, according to Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson. In a statement last month, Larson insisted that Fort Stewart and its affiliated Hunter Army Airfield do not have ""a gang or militia problem."" ""Any suspicions of gang activity are actively investigated by CID, (which) recognizes the obvious concerns with the combination of gangs and military-type training,"" he said. ""That is why CID monitors and investigates gang and extremist group association with criminal acts in the Army so closely. We believe the reason we are able to maintain a low gang criminal threat status is because of the awareness of and focus on the threat."" Fort Stewart, about 40 miles southwest of Savannah, is home to the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division. Tens of thousands of troops, their dependents, civilian personnel and contractors live and work on the base, which encompasses 280,000 acres and includes parts of five counties, including Long County, which has about 14,500 residents. Hunter Army Airfield is in Savannah but is officially part of the larger Fort Stewart complex. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks what it characterizes as ""hate groups"" nationwide, spoke to Aguigui's father last month. ""I served my country for 20 years and I honor that, take pride in that,"" Ed Aguigui told the center, according to the center's Hatewatch blog. ""I don't know what my son's views are, and where they came from.""",1,6.965285562425557
b2dbe5b15e4a41c21abe38b133419587c8f64d22,CNN,"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The trial for seven people accused of manslaughter in connection to an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in the Italian city of L'Aquila was pushed back Saturday to mid-October. The seven -- six scientists from the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV) and a member of the Civil Protection Agency -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a ""rough, generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk"" before the earthquake struck in April 2009. The seven, members of a so-called ""major risks"" panel, published ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population,"" prosecutors have said. The attorney for defendant Enzo Boschi, then-president of the INGV in Rome, told CNN Saturday that the defense had asked for a postponement of 20 days to study new documents and videos submitted by the prosecution. The court's next hearing was scheduled for October 15. Only two defendants, Bernardo De Bernardinis, then vice-director of the Civil Protection Agency, and Mauro Dolce, head of the seismic office at the agency, appeared in court Saturday. Professor Domenico Giardini, current president of the INGV, told CNN the trial was not about science but about the way information was communicated. ""Since people have died, it's necessary to give an answer to the question, 'could some of the deaths have been avoided?'"" he said. ""The trial is basically on that, on the number of weak points in the communication chain."" He said parallels could be drawn between what happened in L'Aquila and elsewhere in the world, such as Japan. ""We all have to work on new, and more clear, protocols, on the transfer of information,"" he said. His colleagues on trial were ""among the best scientists in the world,"" he added, but had taken on an extra responsibility by their presence on the major risks commission. The city of L'Aquila has requested 50 million euros ($68 million) in compensation over the quake. The Civil Protection Agency had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in L'Aquila on March 31, 2009, amid concern among the city's residents over ongoing seismic activity. After that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press. Six days later, the magnitude-6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas, causing wide destruction and loss of life. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) wrote to Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano in June last year to express ""concern"" over the indictment of its Italian colleagues. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) also published a statement last year in which it said the criminal charges brought against the seven accused were ""unfounded."" ""Despite decades of scientific research in Italy and in the rest of the world, it is not yet possible to accurately and consistently predict the timing, location, and magnitude of earthquakes before they occur,"" the AGU statement said. ""It is thus incorrect to assume that the L'Aquila earthquake should have been predicted. The charges may also harm international efforts to understand natural disasters and mitigate associated risk, because risk of litigation will discourage scientists and officials from advising their government or even working in the field of seismology and seismic risk assessment.""

ba856abc54a1e7a29c6626cd19e1c3349d801f47,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Army officer who was honored for valor after his combat outpost in Afghanistan was attacked has also received a letter of reprimand for failing to secure the base before the attack, according to Army officials. Such a letter normally would prevent career advancement. U.S. Army Capt. Matthew Myer received the Silver Star for his part in repelling a Taliban attack on his small combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan in July 2008. The attack, near the village of Wanat, is still the deadliest ground combat of the war involving U.S. troops. A coordinated Taliban attack from the steep hills surrounding the base almost resulted in the outpost being overrun. According to troops who survived, the Taliban came at the base with about 200 fighters, outnumbering the U.S. forces at the base. In the end nine soldiers were killed and 12 were wounded. About 100 Taliban were killed. Despite the heavy U.S. death toll, Myer was awarded the Silver Star for calling in aircraft to beat back the fighters, some of whom had breached the base walls, according to U.S. military officials in Afghanistan. After the attack, the U.S. military scrutinized how enemy forces were allowed to get as close to the base as they did. Officials familiar with the after-action review said Taliban fighters got within grenade-throwing distance of U.S. troops. Myer even called in close air support to hit enemy targets just 10 meters from his own position, according to officials familiar with the after-action report. Four-star Gen. Charles C. Campbell was chosen to review the final investigation and make disciplinary decisions. Campbell decided Myer would receive a career-ending letter of reprimand for failing to prepare the base's defenses sufficiently against an enemy attack. Myer was informed this week of his punishment, according to U.S. military officials. CBS News first reported his punishment. Two of Myer's senior commanders, who were not at the base during the attack, also received similar career-ending letters of reprimand. Officials would not elaborate on the reasons for the reprimands. Army officials acknowledge the base, built to protect the people in Wanat, was at the bottom of a valley surrounded by high hills, an almost impossible location to defend. According to one U.S. military official familiar with the general's decision to reprimand Myer, ""He saw the evidence and made a decision based on that."" However, the same official said, ""Unless you've been there, you don't know how hard those places are to defend."" Myer and his two senior officers are allowed to appeal the punishment. Another U.S. military official familiar with the review said he expects the three officers to meet with Campbell to plead their cases.",3,5.553007187317796
3fc9cd1fcc3140db2a8883eff16d50813a53d445,CNN,"(CNN) -- They're young, fabulously wealthy and have blue blood coursing through their veins. Meet the ""20 Hottest Young Royals"" in the world, compiled by influential fortune tracker, Forbes magazine. Britain's Prince William has been named ""Hottest Young Royal"" in the world by Forbes magazine. The magazine used the ""winning combinations of looks, money, and popularity on the Web"" to come up with the list, it says. Only unmarried royals under the age of 35 were considered. The Forbes list proved to be a Royal knockout for British royalty. They came in the top four of hottest young royals in the world. With his piercing blue eyes and lantern jaw, reminiscent of a movie star, Britain's Prince William, perhaps unsurprisingly, came in at Number 1. The magazine describes him as having: ""international intrigue and unparalleled media attention,"" combined with a ""graceful public persona."" Although his crown slipped somewhat recently when he was accused of abusing his newly-acquired flying skills by ""joyriding.""  Watch who people on the street think is the hottest » . His relationship with girlfriend Kate Middleton is the subject of feverish speculation and an engagement announcement is eagerly anticipated by the British media. Seemingly always languishing in William's shadow,  his brother, Prince Harry, placed second on the list. Harry has always been known as the ""bad boy prince"" because of some rather unroyal behavior, such as brawling with paparazzi outside nightclubs and going to a fancy dress party dressed in Nazi regalia. However, he has latterly re-invented himself as the ""Hero prince"" after a tour of duty in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban in March. Sound off: Is Prince William the world's hottest young royal? William and Harry's cousins Zara Phillips and Princess Beatrice also came in at No. 3 and 4 respectively. The inclusion in the list should be good news for Princess Beatrice, who recently attracted unkind comments from Britain's newspaper columnists about her curvy figure and her dress sense. The sight of Beatrice, 19, pictured on holiday in a bikini proved too much for Daily Mail newspaper columnist Allison Pearson, who wrote: ""Can't someone buy that girl a sarong? For her sake, as well as ours."" This led to an angry counterattack from Beatrice's mum, Sarah Ferguson, who thundered at a news conference to promote a reality show: ""Touch me, fine, but don't touch my children."" The 20 featured on the list represent almost $60 billion in wealth and 15 royal lineages from around the world-- including some rather obscure names that even the most ardent royalist might be hard pushed to recognize. Princess Sikhanyiso of Swaziland anyone? Coming in at Number 20, the eldest daughter of King Mswati III of Swaziland, Africa's last absolute monarch, is currently a speech and drama major at Biola University in California. A controversial princess who raises eyebrows in her homeland with her Western-style clothes and a decision to hold a drinking party to celebrate the end of a chastity decree in 2005 resulted in a beating with a stick. Fourth in line to the Monaco throne, Charlotte Casiraghi, is the only non-Brit to make it into the top 5. A style icon, who is known for her impeccable taste in fashion and her good looks--much like her grandmother, Hollywood icon, Grace Kelly and mother Princess Caroline. Her brother, party prince Andrea Casiraghi, also makes an appearance on the list at Number 10. But it seems even his Hollywood lineage -- as well as his sun-kissed surfer looks were not enough to give William and Harry a run for their money in the pin-up stakes.",7,6.992165278610312
d85463feaa7da685990fa0107e3224b94fc10c06,CNN,"(CNN) -- Everyone has that friend or family member who unwittingly still posts publicly on Facebook. It's not that they're over-sharers, they just haven't bothered to keep up with the social network's ever-changing and often confusing privacy settings. Facebook highlighted some of its minor new and future privacy features on Tuesday, including one aimed squarely at the people left behind by complicated settings. A new pop-up message featuring a cartoon dinosaur will appear for Facebook users who haven't tinkered with their privacy settings in a while. When someone who always shares publicly posts a link or update, Facebook will double check that they really want to share it with that audience. The company's privacy team is also testing other tweaks, including updating mobile and Web designs with more prominent audience controls, a new default privacy setting for cover photos (old images used to be public, now they're private), and a message clarifying who can see an image you post when your friends re-share it. In its 10 years, the social media company has amassed more than a billion users. That's a lot of people to please, but one area that has received consistent cries of dissatisfaction is privacy. When Facebook updates a setting or adds a feature, there is often a privacy backlash, especially when new sharing settings make information public by default. The company's motto, ""Move fast and break things"" led to broken trust with users. To counteract that sense of wariness, Facebook is making sure future privacy considerations aren't just part of a settings screen, but also taken into account by engineers making new features and at the infrastructure level. ""We understand that some people have felt that Facebook privacy has changed too much in the past,"" said Mike Nowak, a product manager on Facebook's privacy team. Not changing settings ever again isn't an option, so Facebook is searching for new ways to improve the experience that won't anger or alienate users. The company has been running extensive surveys to find out what kind of privacy experiences people are having on the site and in the app. It currently runs 4,000 surveys a day in 27 languages.

9eb9e76a615f3bd45f893b8983113d13618845e9,CNN,"(CNN) -- When authorities arrested Eric Frein near an abandoned airport hangar last week, they found a laptop, first aid supplies, shave kits, DVDs, contact lenses, and even a copy of the New Testament, according to police documents released Wednesday. Frein is charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in an ambush that killed one officer and wounded another outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12. The manhunt for Frein lasted almost seven weeks and involved as many as 1,000 officers at times. Frein's trove of survival supplies indicated that he was well-equipped to survive alone in the wilderness for weeks or even months. A police inventory listed nearly 120 items in the possession of the 31-year-old survivalist and military buff who was captured last week near Tannersville, Pennsylvania. In addition to various articles of clothing and multiple weapons and ammunition, Frein had packed food items such as cup noodles, rice, beans, five-gallon water jugs, crackers, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and even a bottle of soju, a Korean vodka. Authorities also discovered three typed pages of random prayers, a religious plaque and candles. A 14-page handwritten note was found but authorities did release further details. Frein also spent his 48 days on the lam in possession of a radio, binoculars, blankets, a headlamp, glass ashtrays, laundry detergent, batteries, maps, a nail clipper, pots and pans, a propane stove, notebooks, toilet paper, a compass, and glow sticks. Among his high-tech items were a Lenovo Thinkpad, headphones, a wireless mouse and two portable storage drives. Authorities, hoping to find out what is on the laptop, on Saturday asked a judge for permission to search the computer. Frein told authorities he used the laptop and unsecured Wi-Fi accounts during the nearly seven-week search, court documents said. A search warrant application released Wednesday described how authorities had already searched a computer from Frein's home and discovered some disturbing Internet searches that went back to November 2012. The searches included: ""how to escape a manhunt,"" ""can police track cell phone"" and ""ballistics trajectory calculator."" In the ambush outside the state police barracks, Cpl. Bryon Dickson was killed and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",1,5.818912880148654

SANA, a Syrian-run news agency, said the death toll could rise because at least 10 more people were seriously wounded. A suicide bomber detonated more than a ton of explosives in a truck on a busy street near a farm machinery company, SANA said. More than 20 vehicles and some homes and stores were damaged, it reported. Meanwhile, clashes between the Syrian military and rebel brigades continue to rage on the eastern outskirts of the government-held city, the London-based Syrian opposition group said. Lebanese hostages released after 17 months . Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, reported at least 15 killings in other parts of the country. Eight people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs, six in Aleppo province and one in Homs province. According to the United Nations, well over 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said Sunday in Cairo that peace talks were scheduled for November 23 in Geneva, Switzerland, but the date is not firm. ""There are many arrangements to be made and many difficulties which must be overcome to make this conference possible,"" he said. The proposed conference between Syrian government officials and opposition leaders, intended to broker an end to the country's civil war, has been delayed several times. Syria's deputy prime minister said Thursday that the ""presumed dates"" had been agreed to during a conference in the Russian Foreign Ministry. U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said Sunday that he plans to meet with Russian and U.S. officials as well other representatives of the U.N. Security Council to finalize details. He also stressed that no meeting could be held without a ""convincing opposition that represents Syria's opposition population.""

87f25b196db9ac81ade340f250670e43b9a1f24a,CNN,"(CNN) -- (CNN) -- The hostage standoff in St. Joseph, Louisiana, has ended with the hostage-taker and one hostage dead, police said. Louisiana State Police shot and killed Fuaed Abdo Ahmed as they stormed the Tensas State Bank, just before midnight local time, according to Col. Michael Edmonson. He said the gunman had threatened to kill the hostages. The two hostages -- a man and a woman -- were both shot by Ahmed as the police SWAT team entered the bank, Edmonson said. One of the hostages later died, and the condition of the second former hostage remains critical. Police said Ahmed was known to police, and Edmonson described him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Ahmed told hostage negotiators that he heard voices and wanted to have a device removed from his head. Edmonson said authorities believe Ahmed planned the events at the bank. They found a book on hostage negotiations at the bank after he was killed. Earlier in the evening, one bank employee was freed, while two of her colleagues remained held at gunpoint. Born in California, Ahmed moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said. The Mississippi River community of St. Joseph is about 35 miles south of Tallulah, Louisiana, and 35 miles north of Natchez, Mississippi. It is the seat of Tensas Parish, which has about 5,000 people. The incident began around 12:30 p.m., when the 20-year-old man entered the bank branch in St. Joseph with a handgun, taking the three bank employees hostage, according to officials. After word got out about the hostage situation, local, state and federal law enforcement agents descended on the quiet community. Law enforcement agents were able to talk to the hostages. They also spoke with the gunman. Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages. In 2012: Gunman wounded, ending French hostage incident .

84cb9e67c1e8c816efdf59b4df9601ea2731e6f1,CNN,"(CNN) -- It reads like something out of a Japanese monster movie: Enormous angry hornets invade cities, dive-bomb unsuspecting civilians, and inflict horrifically painful and in some cases fatal stings. But it's not science fiction, it's real. Every year around this time, the Asian giant hornets move into cities in China, Japan, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and other areas in Asia to forage for food for their young, and that's where the trouble starts. More than 40 people have died so far this season from the powerful stings and scores have been hospitalized. Emergency response teams are on the hunt for the nests to destroy them before the insects do more damage, and authorities have set up medical units to treat the injured. So what do the hornets have against city dwellers? Nothing, really. The hornets just happen to be in an unusually desperate situationn -- largely due to humans. The revulsion and panic that people feel when they read about these incidents or see pictures on TV and on the Internet should be about something more than fear. It should provide a moment to consider the impact of humans on their environment--one that can end up biting them back. Asian giant hornets don't eat much solid food as adults; instead, they forage for food for their young, often stealing the larvae of honeybees or other insects, but sometimes they forage for scraps of fish in city garbage cans. Then they fly incredible distances to deliver the food, arriving exhausted and starving. They get their only nutrition from their children. That's right: The babies feed the parents. These grub-like hornet larvae enjoy the meal their parents have brought them, then the parents tap on their heads, which prompts the larvae to offer up a few drops of clear liquid. The amino acids and other nutrients in this liquid fuels the adult hornets, and they fly off in search of more food. Sounds aggravating, doesn't it? I'd be angry, too, if I had to go to that much effort to feed my young. At one time, the hornets could forage through forests and fields to find a meal for the kids. But now, as those wild areas are paved over, the hornets find themselves on our turf. Their search for food is as desperate and fast-paced as it ever was, only now they must contend with parking lots and apartment buildings where they once only had to battle other insect foes. This is not the first time that we humans have moved into wild areas and found ourselves doing battle with wild creatures as a result. One example: In the 19th century, great swaths of Brazilian wilderness were hacked down to make room for plantations. Once people started living in areas that had been wild, they found themselves exposed to new diseases that had never before posed much of a threat to humans. The assassin bug, a bloodsucking insect native to the region, helps transmit a disease called Chagas disease. It had never before been widespread among humans; its reach was primarily confined to other jungle-dwelling animals. But once people moved into the insect's habitat, the disease began to spread among us and continues to do so. The deaths inflicted by the Asian giant hornet threat are indeed tragic. But they also serve as a reminder that nature is fierce and powerful. The hornets are not invasive; in this case, it is the humans who are invasive. There can be consequences to moving in on another creature's territory. The Asian giant hornet is feeling the pressure that species all over the world are experiencing. The only difference is that the hornet has found a way to push back. Can you blame it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Stewart.",7,8.076671615696213
b39226e755234e692fe4bce75e6287ac4ca1aa2d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Did you know that there exists an all-natural remedy for memory loss? Weight gain? Macular degeneration? Prostate enlargement? These products are so successful that clinical testing has already begun! Just listen to the following testimonial from an unidentified person ... As these ads blare at you from your favorite AM radio station, perhaps you wonder: How can this be legal? Since the late 1960s, aspirin makers have been trying to win the right to tell the public that a daily low-dose tablet can help prevent heart disease. They have been told no, and no, and no again. Federal regulators are so nervous about over-selling aspirin's benefits that they have restricted statements about aspirin to the most bland and basic. Yet while the statements about aspirin have to be cushioned in the vaguest generalities, snake oil flim-flam can be huckstered in the most truth-defying way, thanks to a 1994 law coaxed through Congress by the people who make these drugs. The law bears the long title of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. It was sponsored in House of Representatives by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana, and in the Senate by Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. The DSHEA law draws a line between synthesized medicines like aspirin and remedies made from herbs, minerals, vitamins and amino acids. This latter group was recategorized as ""dietary supplements"" -- that is, as foods rather than drugs. ""Drugs"" are subjected to exacting scientific trial to prove them both safe and also effective. Sellers of dietary supplements are not required to prove that their remedies work. They are not even required to prove them safe -- as ""foods"" they are presumed safe unless shown otherwise. ""Drugs"" must disclose any risk of side effect. (That's why those erectile dysfunction ads terrify TV audiences with their references to four-hour erections.) Dietary supplements bear no such burden -- which is why St. John's wort can be sold as an anti-depressant, without any mention of the disturbing indications that the herb weakens the effectiveness of birth control pills. ""Drug"" advertising must be pre-approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which minutely reviews the ads' accuracy. Dietary supplement advertising is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. So long as supplements avoid promises to cure a specific disease, their sellers can say pretty much whatever they want, provided only that they have some kind of supporting evidence on file. That evidence does not have to meet any kind of scientific test: pretty much any pattern of ink on paper will do the job. I cannot say, ""My rosemary-sage-thyme-and-oregano tablets cure AIDS."" But if I pay my cousin $100 to do a few experiments, I can claim, ""My tablets boost the immune system -- and clinical trials are under way!"" (There is an exception to the permissive rules about advertising natural products: wine. There is substantial evidence that a glass of red wine a day reduces the risk of heart attack. The laws of most states forbid any hint or suggestion that moderate alcohol use might confer health benefits. Still, if you ask the scientists, wine has better grounds to call itself a health food than does, say, echinacea!) Fifteen years after receiving the favor of Congress, dietary supplements have grown into a $24 billion a year industry. Most of the products sold by the industry are merely useless. For those who eat a balanced diet, scientists have found no quantifiable benefit from taking multivitamins. On the other hand, multivitamins probably won't do any harm. It would be better to give the $10 you spend on a jar of pills to the Salvation Army, but at least you are not poisoning yourself. The same could not be said, alas, for the unfortunate customers of a Belgian herbal dispensary who bought a supplement that contained the herb Aristolochia fangi. The A. fangi herb is rich in aristolochic acid, a carcinogen -- and users experienced an outbreak of urinary tract cancers. A. Fangi has since been banned in the European Union. It remains legal in the United States. As outrages go, Congress' special favor to the herbal supplement industry might seem relatively small stuff: a splash in the torrent of the $2 trillion per year that Americans spend on health and wellness. And yet in the midst of a great national debate over health care, this small outrage has some serious implications. Advocates for the herbal supplement industry justify their special sweet deal by championing the right of consumers to make their own ""health choices."" Individual choice certainly sounds like the American way. But the fact is that most of us are not well positioned to make intelligent health choices. If we try to play our own doctor, we are going to expose our health -- and our money -- to risk and exploitation. As individuals, we have trouble distinguishing between anecdotes: ""My neighbor took zinc for her cold and she said it really helped,"" and data: Most colds last four days, so you could smoke yak-dung cigarettes on day three and feel better on day four. We are poor balancers of risk: Look at the rising number of Americans who resist taking vaccines because of astronomically remote chances that something might go wrong. We are vulnerable to placebos: ""Hey -- I took the 30-day free sample and I feel sure my vision did improve!"" We are swayed by prejudice and ideology: The film-maker Spike Lee wrote in Rolling Stone in 1992: ""I'm convinced AIDS is a government-engineered disease."" The reason we should defer to experts is not that the experts know everything. Of course they don't. It's just that they know more than non-experts do. It's not that science has all the answers. It doesn't. It's just that astrologers, shamans, and natural healers have none of them. Americans spend over 50 percent more per person on their health than anyone else on earth. For all that extra money, Americans see very little benefit. Americans rank 42nd on earth in life expectancy, 29th in infant mortality. Improving and rationalizing this costly and dysfunctional system is a gigantic, maybe impossible, task. But one small reform could strike a meaningful blow for reason and cost-effectiveness: Apply the rules governing the advertising of aspirin to the advertising of oregano tablets. Repeal the DSHEA law and give the Food and Drug Administration full authority over every manufactured substance that purports to promote health or relieve illness.

24294fa4bd0effa47cc0fa79e21cacf94f1cc3ea,CNN,"(CNN) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said. Tamil demonstrators call for a cease-fire in Sri Lanka during a rally Saturday in Paris, France. ""The government is firm that (the rebels) lay down their arms and surrender. We do not recognize this so-called offer,"" said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security. The proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in the country's northern area. Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources. A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast. Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of ""fresh displacement"" has now exceeded 100,000 individuals. ""In the face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and in response to the calls made by the U.N., EU, the governments of the USA, India and others, the (LTTE) has announced an unilateral cease-fire. All of LTTE's offensive military operations will cease with immediate effect,"" the rebel leaders said in a written statement issued earlier Sunday. ""We welcome the attempts by the U.N. and its agencies to assist the civilian population and are ready to engage and cooperate with them to address the humanitarian needs of the population. ... We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease-fire."" The Tiger leadership asked the international community to ""pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate"" on the cease-fire offer. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.",7,9.304858144654746
7d729d3f5f2625e8f2f4be396884c7b7071afa95,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park last week filed a personal injury lawsuit just a few weeks earlier, claiming he suffers from ""serious, permanent and debilitating injuries."" Video of Glenn Taylor shoving the huge rock off a slender pedestal where it rested for millions of years went viral online and prompted media scrutiny. As his friend sang ""Wiggle it, just a little bit,"" Taylor pushed the delicate sculpture over, which was followed by laughter and high fives with his son. The attention has led to revelations that Taylor filed a personal injury lawsuit in September, claiming he had suffered ""serious, permanent and debilitating injuries"" from a 4-year-old car crash. ""Someone with a bad back who's disabled, who can't enjoy life, to me, doesn't step up and push a rock that big off the base,"" the defendant in Taylor's lawsuit, Alan MacDonald, told Salt Lake City television station KTVX. 'You didn't see how hard I pushed' Taylor's lawyer did not return calls for comment. But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, ""You didn't see how hard I pushed."" CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said when someone has a pending disability lawsuit, ""you'd think they'd avoid the camera like the plague. ""But instead, they think no one will ever see it or repercussions will ever come of it,"" Cevallos said. 'Glenn saved his life' Goblin Valley, in southern Utah, is home to thousands of the mushroom-shaped rocks -- known to locals as goblins -- that developed as millions of years of winds and water eroded sandstone cliffs. Taylor and two other men were leading a Boy Scout group on a visit to the park when the incident happened. The men, all from Utah, defended their actions in interviews last week, saying the delicate structure posed a threat to visitors. ""We have now modified Goblin Valley, a new Goblin Valley exists,"" David Hall, who shot the video, is heard saying at the end of it. ""That's crazy that it was held up just by that little bit of dirt. Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley. Saving lives. That's what we're all about."" Hall told Utah television station KUTV that the boulder seemed unstable. ""That wasn't going to last very long at all,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""One gust of wind and a family's dead."" Asked if he would do it again, he said, ""Absolutely, absolutely."" 'Didn't look like a stiff wind to me' Park officials suggested the men broke the law by defacing a state park. Jeff Rasmussen, the deputy director of Utah State Parks and Recreation, said, ""It didn't look like a stiff wind to me."" ""Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed,"" he told KUTV. In his 22 years on the job, he said he had not heard of any goblins rolling off their pedestals. Connection to Arias trial . All three have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles. The National Boy Scouts of America and the organization's Utah National Parks Council issued almost simultaneous and similar statements Monday addressing the men's actions. The local council statement said the former leaders violated the Scouts' principle of ""Leave no trace,"" which it said ""teaches the value of natural areas and the methods we can use to help protect and conserve these areas for future generations."" Meanwhile, the man who shot the video, Hall, is tied to another nationally publicized case: the Jodi Arias murder trial. Throughout the Arias trial, Hall appeared numerous times on HLN to talk about the life and legacy of his friend Travis Alexander and to paint an unflattering picture of his killer, Arias.

942e7b66173b4813972db36165d1cd1f9e491dbe,CNN,"(CNN) -- Is it the end of an era for a side recognized as one of the best in football history? Just four players made the squads for all three of Barcelona's Champions League successes of 2006, 2009 and 2011 -- and now the first is set to leave in the shape of club captain Carles Puyol. On Tuesday, the all-action defender -- who turns 36 next month -- announced that he will sever ties at the end of the current season. This leaves midfielders Xavi, Andres Iniesta and goalkeeper Victor Valdes -- the only one of the quartet to play every minute of all three finals -- as the last bastions of those era-defining teams. ""After two very serious operations, I'm finding it very hard to get back to the level I need to be at to stay here,"" he told a news conference at Barca's training ground. ""Much more than I thought and much more than the surgeons told me. That's why I have made this decision."" Puyol's contract had been set to expire in 2016 but it will now terminate two years early because of the persistent knee trouble the veteran has experienced in recent years. Having spent seven months out of the game before returning last October, the defender has managed just five league games this season. Puyol, who captained Barca to victory in the 2006 and 2009 Champions League finals, has made 593 appearances for Barcelona, more than any outfield player save for Xavi's 709. Xavi, who skippered the side in the 2011 after Puyol was forced to start the game on the bench because of injury, celebrated his 34th birthday in January, although time would be appear to be on the sides of Valdes, 32, and Iniesta, 29. Iniesta, Xavi, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho may have lit up Barcelona's play with their sumptuous skills but it's questionable whether they embodied the Barca side during their years of dominance quite like Puyol. Defying his poodle-style haircut, the defender's displays were typified by his 'thou-shalt-not-pass' spirit as he made up for his relatively short stature for a center back (standing 5ft 10 inches) with unbridled commitment. Having made his debut against Valladolid in October 1999 under coach Louis van Gaal, Puyol spent the first five seasons of his Barca career without winning any silverware. So what does it say about the versatile defender, who moved to the center after starting out on the right, that this all changed in the very season he was appointed club captain? On May 14 2005, Barcelona drew 1-1 at Levante to win La Liga for the first time since 1999 -- sparking an avalanche of trophies. Five more league titles would follow in addition to two Spanish Cups, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and the Champions League titles. Success also followed at international level where Puyol became part of an historic Spain side that ended a 44-year wait for a major trophy when clinching the 2008 European Championship, before then lifting the World Cup for the first time in 2010 -- with Puyol's header having knocked out a dangerous Germany in the semifinals. As he addressed the media on Tuesday, with another club legend -- Gerard Pique -- a notable attendee, Puyol explained that he will attempt to finish his Barcelona career with the attitude that has been his hallmark. ""There are three months of the season left and anyone that knows me will know that I won't give up and I'll keep fighting to the end to try to improve and help the team to achieve its objectives this season,"" he was quoted as saying by Barcelona's own website. ""I don't know what I'll do after June 30, but what I am sure of is that when the season ends I'm going to need to get some rest. I haven't stopped for four years because of injuries. After that, we'll see what happens."" Puyol joined Barcelona's youth team in 1995 and has never played for any other club. His onfield successes aside, the Spaniard will also be remembered for his gracious gesture during the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. Despite appearing as a late substitute in the 3-1 win over Manchester United, the club captain passed up the opportunity to lift the trophy and instead handed the honor to Eric Abidal, who had had surgery to remove a liver tumor just two months earlier. That may well be among the many questions thrown his way at the end of the season, when Puyol says he will be delighted to reflect on his two decades at one of football's most distinguished clubs. ""I'd like to give a press conference at the end of the season and say farewell to all the people that have accompanied me though these 19 years,"" he said. ""Whoever wants to, whoever can -- presidents, directors, coaches, teammates, people from the club, reporters, friends, relatives -- that day I'll answer whatever questions they want. ""Thank you very much and see you soon!""",7,10.747959116125314
13c17f62c4ee8f7d7c574864542bcf74de11b25d,CNN,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In a recent discussion of what his administration might accomplish, Mitt Romney claimed that ""by virtue of the policies that we put in place, we'd get the unemployment rate down to 6%, and perhaps a little lower,"" over a period of four years. Is this goal attainable? It is. Indeed, it is not that tough a task. If the United States avoids new growth-retarding policies, such as the tax hikes scheduled for January 1, the economy's natural adjustments will lower unemployment substantially. These include downward adjustments in wages, reallocation of job-seekers from slower to faster growing sectors and regions, reduced in-migration plus increased out-migration, and withdrawals from the labor force. These adjustments do not always work quickly or for everyone (not every former construction worker can become a computer technician). But history suggests the adjustments do occur, as they have since the recession began. Over the next four years, they will continue to lower the unemployment rate, if not to 6%, at least near that territory. The more important task for either presidential candidate is restoring the economy to its prerecession growth path. Real GDP has historically grown about 3% per year, and major downturns have been followed by strong recoveries. Within two to three years, therefore, output is typically ""back where it would have been."" In this recession, the rapid recovery phase has so far been absent; real GDP is still well below where one would have predicted pre-2008, and with average growth under 3% since the recession ended, the gap grows larger every quarter. So can Romney, or anyone, get us back to a higher growth rate? Yes. Here is a program that will restore U.S. economic performance: . • Cancel all the tax increases scheduled to take effect at the end of 2012 and provide tax stability going forward. Make (all) the Bush tax cuts permanent. Repeal the alternative minimum tax. Eliminate the health care law's increases in the hospital insurance tax. All this will stimulate in the short term and set the stage for long-term growth. • Reform the tax code by eliminating the misguided deductions, exemptions, credits and loopholes that distort incentives and reward special interests. These features include big-ticket items like the deductibility of mortgage interest and employer-paid health insurance premiums, plus myriad small but senseless other provisions. • Lower the corporate income tax rate. The U.S. corporate tax environment is one of the least business-friendly in the world. Driving investment overseas cannot be good policy. • Slow the growth of entitlements. The U.S. can afford a social safety net, but our current programs are not sustainable, even in a robustly growing economy. Everyone should agree, at a minimum, to cuts that are sufficient to prevent these programs -- Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security -- from bankrupting the country. • Embrace immigration. Despite recent difficulties, the United States is still an attractive destination for those seeking a better life. By expanding immigration for low-skill workers, we restrain labor costs and reduce out-migration of manufacturing and other business. By easing immigration for high-skill workers -- many of them trained in the United States at taxpayer expense -- we get a return on our investment and retain industrious and innovative people. • Scale back military involvements around the world. A strong national defense makes sense, but it must focus on protecting the United States, not paying for Europe's defense or trying to force democracy down the throats of countries that are not receptive. • Cease the campaign against carbon-based fuels. Green energy may have its day, but only when coal, oil and gas become truly scarce. In the foreseeable future, traditional energy is much cheaper, and subsidies for alternative energy are a waste. • Stop scapegoating the rich and pretending that tax-hikes on the 1% can balance the budget. Everyone knows the numbers do not add up. • Respect capitalism. Anti-business rhetoric, which casts all success as undeserved, and which fails to recognize the improvements in material well-being that result from entrepreneurial success, just drive away talented people and guarantee our economic demise. If the United States adopts these policies, it will not only attain Romney's 6% unemployment goal, it will once again be the economic beacon of the world. What's wrong with that?

e3a252fab6b198d52da212a0fca92df75997233e,CNN,"(CNN) -- A lengthy investigation into the erratic behavior of a Brazilian accused of ordering the murder of a 73-year-old American nun led to his recent arrest, a Brazilian prosecutor in the state of Para told CNN. U.S. missionary sister Dorothy Stang as seen in 2004 working in the Amazon forest in Para, Brazil. Regivaldo Pereira Galvao was recently seen at what authorities say is the site of the 2005 slaying of Sister Dorothy Stang to pressure peasants there into giving him the property rights, said federal prosecutor Felicio Pontes Tuesday. The site is located in a 7,400 acre plot known as ""Lot 55"" that is under dispute in the Amazon. Police arrested Galvao Friday on charges of land fraud and slavery. He is already facing a conspiracy to murder charge in connection with Stang's death. Before her death, Stang had defended the right of landless peasants by giving them access to public land and promoting sustainable farming practices that would help halt deforestation. Her land distribution project, the Project for Sustainable Development (PDS), has received praise by officials with the Brazilian government. ""Sister Dorothy's PDS project is the very most successful land reform project in the Amazon,"" said Pontes, adding, ""It has helped more than 300 settlers make a living in a sustainable way."". A recently released film called, ""They Killed Sister Dorothy,"" narrated by American actor Martin Sheen, has won international acclaim for its original, in-depth investigation of Stang's life and the details surrounding her murder. The film contains exclusive interviews and information that will be used against the suspects, Brazilian investigators told CNN. ""This film has been very important for us. It not only explains the dilemma Brazilians are facing in protecting the Amazon, but it also contains interviews with the suspects which we will certainly use against them,"" said Pontes. Aside from Galvao, five people have been accused in Stang's killing. Four have been convicted, and one has been acquitted. Stang was gunned down along a muddy road near Lot 55 as she worked with the peasants. Galvao's presence at Lot 55 adds to evidence against him in the murder case, Pontes said. ""We have been keeping an eye on him since he left prison, since he has always said he had nothing to do with that land, and therefore was not behind the murder of Sister Dorothy,"" Pontes told CNN. ""Now we nailed him, we know he lied and he did have a lot of interest in that allotment,"" he said. Galvao sat in prison for a year after Stang's death while awaiting trial. He was released by Brazil's high court in 2006, though he is still awaiting trial. Galvao has consistently denied illegally obtaining land and being involved in Stang's murder. He has also denied any involvement with Lot 55, which has been divided among poor settlers for Stang's sustainable farming projects. ""I'm deeply sorry about this whole tragedy, but I am also a victim of it,"" Galvao said in a statement from jail after his arrest in 2005 which was posted on a Web site that proclaims his innocence. ""I'm innocent. I never stained my hands with any crime, or ordered anyone else to stain theirs."" Prosecutors accuse Galvao of forging land titles and forcefully seizing public lands under the government's law reform program. Elizabeth Dowyer, a nun with the Sisters of Notre Dame where Stang was ordained, told CNN she was happy when she heard the announcement of Galvao's arrest. ""We are relieved in a sense because we knew he was also involved in slavery and he was an illegal land grabber,"" she said. ""We also strongly believe he was involved in a consortium to grab that plot."" Dowyer, who also was involved in Stang's land reform movement in the Amazon, said Stang knew her would-be killers and even prayed for them. ""In her letters, she named the people she tried to mediate with. On the night before her death, she invited her own killers who bragged to the community of what they were about to do,"" she said. ""She really believed people could change."" The day after the meeting, hired killers murdered her, Dowyer said. Land reform is the crux of many of Brazil's social problems. Most agricultural lands rest in the hands of a few wealthy landowners, who are engaged in export-crops like soy and sugar cane as well as cattle ranching, according to the Landless Peasant Movement in Brazil.",1,7.686910811187837
e20cbf087440b0f5121eb3a1bf0d8e9210f5ec74,CNN,"Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- On Tijuana's Avenue de la Revolucion, street vendor and sidewalk philosopher Juan Ramon Rocha leaned on his coin and jewelry cart and waited. But the tourists from across the border never rushed into the streets of T.J., as it's often called. Rocha made one sale, to a local resident, in an hour. ""The business, you can see for yourself, it went down 95 percent,"" he said. ""Please tell them, the Americans, it's safe to come here. We are all Americanos, North Americanos. Do you see any problems here?"" A few yards away, there was a donkey painted like a zebra, hitched to a cart full of sombreros, a Tijuana photo opportunity. But no smiling tourists stepped into the picture frame. Visitors have been scared off because at least 18,000 people have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon dispatched the army to fight the drug cartels in December 2006. Tijuana's grisliest murders include decapitations, dismemberments, dozens of police killings and the deaths of three teenagers at school. Fear of Tijuana's streets seeps deep into California. As groups of 240 students from Westmont College near Santa Barbara, California, drove down the coast to do missionary work in Ensenada, Mexico, none ventured to Tijuana. The missionaries doing spring break volunteer projects in poor neighborhoods were given a simple edict: Do not stop in T.J. Hanna Walker kneeled, pounding nails into shingles, on a rooftop of a small house taking shape on a dirt road high above Ensenada. ""To be honest, I was a tiny bit nervous crossing the border,"" Walker said. ""I've been to Mexico before, but not for service projects. But now that I have been here [Ensenada] a couple days, I am perfectly comfortable."" The Westmont students are taking precautions as part of their annual Potter's Clay missionary work. ""We are staying in a group,"" Walker explained. ""We are making sure that I am with someone all the time. When we went downtown for dinner, we just paired up and walked around in twos, the buddy system. We locked cars. We're just being smart about it."" Ensenada welcomes any business it can get, as its tourism trade has also been choked off by concerns about border violence. Fortunately, cruise ships still dock in Ensenada's Bahia de Los Santos, a daily divine arrival that spills cash-carrying tourists onto shore. But we saw just two visitors who said they drove over the border to visit Ensenada. All the other beer-carrying, trinket-buying tourists came from the ship. ""People are afraid of driving by Tijuana,"" said Papas and Beer manager Cesar Marquez. ""That's what's hurting us [Ensenada] the most."" Later, in Tijuana, as the shadows stretched out with the dropping sun, we were approached by a man with an outdated nylon jacket. His cheeks were chipped by acne scars. The camera was far out of sight. ""I can help you find whatever you need,"" he said. ""What do you want? I help people find the good clubs and get dates and more. You pay me."" We told him we were journalists on a story and not interested. ""Oh then pay me, and I will tell you a lot for your story, about everything that goes on here,"" the hustler said. Everything -- did he mean drugs or guns, or both? We had no intent to find out, kept to our tight travel schedule and drove out of Tijuana to a border crossing just several cars deep. More than five years ago, that vehicle line extended so far back into Mexico, a re-entry at San Ysidro, California, could take hours. We zipped through the checkpoint in 10 minutes, another sign that Mexico's border violence is frightening off American tourists.",3,8.972918766937207
0dcb52466611fdec8cfa8c8f19879f2520f5d021,CNN,"(CNN) -- More than 1 million cancer deaths could be prevented around the world if more nations, particularly low- and middle-income countries, implemented known strategies targeting such deaths, two international groups say. It's doable, according to the Union for International Cancer Control and International Agency for Research on Cancer, if countries adopt measures to meet the ""25 by 25"" targets the World Health Organization set last year. The targets aim to reduce premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases by 25% by 2025. Cancer deaths total about 7.6 million worldwide each year. Of those, 4 million are in people ages 30 to 69 -- defined as ""premature"" by the two cancer organizations. ""With the right strategies, at least 30% of (all) cancer cases can be prevented based on current knowledge,"" according to the Union for International Cancer Control. The groups made the announcement Monday, the eighth World Cancer Day. The Union for International Cancer Control -- the largest nongovernmental cancer-fighting organization with more than 760 partners in 155 countries -- organized the day to raise awareness among individuals and governments about cancer and cancer prevention. More than 450 events were held to raise awareness Monday, the group said. This year's theme: to highlight and dispel myths and misconceptions about cancer, including that it is a ""disease of the wealthy, elderly and developed countries,"" according to the organization. In reality, cancer affects those of all ages and income levels worldwide. More lives being saved: Cancer death rates drop 20% . In fact, ""more (cancer) deaths occur in lower and middle-income countries, than in high-income high cancer countries, even though there are twice as many cases in high-income countries,"" said Peter Boyle, president of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France. Boyle is the main author of World Breast Cancer Report 2012, which was published by the institute and funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure. It was released Monday. According to his report, more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, compared with about 641,000 in 1980. More than 425,000 will die from the disease each year. ""I was shocked by some of the things we found,"" Boyle said, adding he believes there are various reasons why women in poorer countries are diagnosed late. Lack of treatment is one. He cites an example: In Bangladesh, there is one trained oncologist for 150 million people. There's also a lot of stigma preventing women from seeking treatment. ""It's a very, very sad thing,"" Boyle said. For example, in Kenya and Uganda, 100% of women seek help with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, said Boyle. Metastatic breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body; advanced breast cancer means it's the most advanced stage of breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast. In both cases, a late diagnosis can impede efforts toward a cure. By comparison, the report said, ""It is calculated that less than 10% of the breast cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with LABC (locally advanced breast cancer). Women in the United States are not immune from late diagnoses."" After cancer, my real fight began . Julie Gerberding, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Monday addressed the Global Women's Cancer Summit in Washington, a gathering the Komen Foundation hosted. She described three women who died from cancer, either because they didn't know they had the disease or didn't take advantage of screening. They were her aunts, she said, and lived in the United States. Two had breast cancer, and one had cervical cancer. Gerberding said it's a problem ""from Arkansas all the way to Zimbabwe."" ""We must get better at implementing what we already know,"" said Gerberding, who is now president of Merck Vaccines. The summit launched its own ""25"" goal: to improve breast cancer survival and quality of life in 2.5 million women living in low- and middle-income countries by 2025. So much could be done, Boyle said, if existing prevention screening techniques such as mammography and breast self-exams were used and existing treatments were available. He quoted the popular Nike slogan ""just do it."" ""If every woman in the world had adequate knowledge of breast cancer, had access to early diagnostic programs, had access to high-quality diagnostic services and (was) treated according to the most appropriate protocol for their particular disease, then breast cancer mortality would drop rapidly and significantly and have a profound effect on global women's health,"" according to the breast cancer report.

147cc493782eb6c509760ec49d5f48a2f3991066,CNN,"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney is a paradox. If you saw a photo of him and didn't know who he was, you might assume from the square jaw, trappings of wealth and arcane haircut that he was the perfect country-club Republican. But that would be too simple, especially in this election. Romney only looks like an insider. But in many ways, he has remained an outsider. Politics: Romney's 'all' proved not enough . For one thing, the Romney-Ryan presidential ticket, which lost the election Tuesday to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, was the first in history not to include a Protestant. (Romney would have been the first Mormon president, Rep. Paul Ryan is Catholic.) He's a Republican who won election in a blue state. The people of Massachusetts may know the former governor as a bipartisan moderate, yet he sold himself on the national stage as ""severely conservative."" In his own state, he invented what many regard as the prototype for Obamacare, yet he repeatedly vowed to repeal Obama's version of it. Kennedy: Obama's win won't transform America . Is he moderate or is he conservative? The same question could be asked of the Republican Party -- and the GOP's own lack of ideological clarity is probably the exact reason why it nominated him. Cometh the hour, cometh the multidimensional man. Today's Republicans find themselves in a dilemma. On the one hand, they have an enormous base of hyped-up voters who passionately subscribe to economic and social conservatism. They needed to energize that base to win. On the other hand, the margin of victory rested with a group of moderates and independents who like their politics a little more practical. The challenge of 2012 was to take the tea party agenda and rebrand it so that it could still appeal to the right but also win converts in the center. That was Romney's job -- and he didn't quite pull it off. Yet, if anyone could have, it would have been Mitt. Why Wall Street hates Obama . I suspect that the Republicans nominated Romney partly because he spent so much money acquiring the nomination but also because his personality seemed suitably vague. To be assigned to report on his rallies carried all the thrill of being asked to submit a 10,000-word critical analysis of a church picnic. His speeches were flat at best and goofy at worst. His attire was sensible trousers and shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and the family was so wholesomely large that you sensed they could swing a primary just by registering the grandkids. But squareness was just what the GOP was looking for. In an era of recession, his business experience seemed like a big plus and his polished-yet-gentle style was a nice contrast to Obama's flashy rhetoric. It was understood that he had been a technocratic governor of Massachusetts, with a record on social issues that at times wandered a bit to the left. As I always explained to my British colleagues bemused at the irresistible rise of Mitt Romney, one of his greatest strengths was that he didn't look crazy. You could trust this man with the nuclear codes, whereas putting the entire arsenal of the free world in the hands of one of his primary challengers, like Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich, felt risky. But to win the primaries, Romney still needed the votes of that big block of conservatives. So he underwent a rebranding. For the record, the conservative movement never entirely bought Romney's conversion. That's why he lost Iowa to Santorum and South Carolina to Gingrich. Thereafter he was dogged for some weeks by Santorum, whose electoral coalition tended to be poorer, more religious, more conservative and more rural. In these truly competitive primaries, Romney's vote was often rich, moderate and elderly (no wonder Mr. Burns was such a fan). Mitt was, in fact, the country-club candidate. He won primaries largely thanks to the support of people like him, and he only won because there are so many people like him in the Republican Party. But all the while, his empty pitch to the GOP base moved him rhetorically further and further to the right. Share your opinions on the election results . Of course, philosophical conservatism isn't necessarily an electoral negative for the GOP. It worked for Reagan in the 1980s and George W Bush in the 2000s. But whereas Democratic populism is programmatic (health care for all, tax the rich) for the Republicans it has tended to be personal (dress like a cowboy, eat TV dinners). The problem was that Mitt lacked the requisite performance skills -- he's no Reagan -- which ended up converting his greatest strength into his greatest weakness. With unemployment running high and debt spiraling out of control, we might have expected Romney's ability to make money to be a plus. Instead, it only emphasized his difference from you and me. He had money nestling in the Cayman Islands. He only paid 14.1% on a fortune that would make King Midas blush. Worst of all, he had worked in private equity, and while he helped save a lot of jobs, he was probably responsible for downsizing a few, too. Romney insisted that he left Bain before it committed its greatest sins, but the image of Mitt cheerfully declaring, ""I like being able to fire people"" stuck in the minds of many voters. Romney's broader appeal was buried beneath a wave of scandal and political character assassination. It was the debates that allowed him to regain control of the narrative. In that first debate he was clever, funny, energetic and passionate -- and in many ways outclassed Obama. My theory is that Romney flourished because the format was like a corporate job interview: question after question, a little light sparring, an emphasis upon ""pep"" (""Gee, I'd just love to run your country. When can I start?!""). The inner-intern shone through and Romney behaved like a smart kid out of college who's hungry to get his foot on the corporate ladder. Kamarck: Five things Obama must do . His performance was so good that it was historic, transforming the election in a way that few have ever done. It worked because Romney did what the GOP was waiting for him to do all year. He appealed to the center by sounding reasonable and moderate but he also fired up the base by saying things to Obama that they wanted to hear said. This was Romney at his very best -- and it's difficult to image an alternative candidate who could have done better. But, ultimately, the contradictions inherent within both Romney and his party simply couldn't be overcome. The need to be both conservative and moderate confused and frustrated the electorate who were never quite sure what they were voting for. So the advantage fell to the incumbent. The ambivalent American public went with the devil they knew. What next for Mitt Romney? Don't be surprised if he returns to his church. He's a man of faith with a record of charity and it would be in keeping for him to dedicate himself to others. I hope the conservative movement and the pundits will be just as charitable to him .

453c35893c0e3dedc20ef0c7a2aecd3ab9ae64f6,CNN,"(CNN) -- Embarrassing defeats, criticism from fans and former players, a major health scare for its long-serving chairman -- Arsenal's season is not getting any easier. The English Premier League club's stalwart figurehead Peter Hill-Wood is recovering in hospital after suffering a heart attack the day before Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at home to Swansea. It left the 13-time English champions 10th in the 20-team EPL after 15 games, continuing Arsenal's worst start to a season since 1994. Hill-Wood had been suffering pneumonia and was taken ill at home on Friday, the London side's website reported on Sunday. ""He is making a good recovery. The club wishes Peter a full and speedy return to health and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time,"" read a statement on Arsenal.com. The 76-year-old has been Arsenal's chairman since 1982, following in the footsteps of his father Denis and his grandfather Samuel, who twice held the role in spells between 1929 and 1949. ""Even if u are not a fan of #Peter Hill-Wood ... wishing him full recovery. He & his family gave so much to #Arsenal in the past!"" one Arsenal supporter wrote on Twitter. Manager Arsene Wenger and the club's board are coming under increasing criticism from fans, who are unhappy that top players such as Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas have been allowed to leave in recent years. Emmanuel Eboue, who was sold to Turkish side Galatasaray last season, also made his feelings known on Twitter after the Swansea defeat . ""Why have we destroyed the club we love so much. The set of players we have now are like chicken fillet. #Arsenal board have abused the fans,"" the Ivory Coast international said. ""Some of the players need to be stoned off the pitch. No brain, no passion, no soul. The Arsenal glory days are fading fast. We need help. ""The only way to put pressure on the board is by fans not coming to the stadium. Low revenue would worry the board and put pressure on boss."" One of the club's celebrity fans, CNN's Piers Morgan, also had harsh words for Wenger -- the club's longest serving manager, with 11 trophies since he joined in 1996 but none since 2005. ""That was the single worst performance of Wenger's reign. It's over -- he must go before he wrecks his great legacy,"" Morgan wrote on Twitter, where he has set up the hashtag #WengerOut. ""Wenger must go, for his sake and for the club's."" Wenger's team have already qualified for the last 16 of the European Champions League, but the Frenchman is looking for a morale-boosting result in Tuesday's final Group B game away to Greek side Olympiakos. ""It's important for us. Away from home, I'm not too concerned,"" the 63-year-old said. ""We look like we play a little bit with the handbrake at home. It's not fluent. There might be a psychological component in there as well. ""At home we have not produced the performances since the beginning of the season that you would expect from us, and that is where we have to find the solution."" Arsenal announced last month that major sponsor Emirates had agreed a new $240 million deal until 2019 for shirt rights and 2028 for stadium naming, but that money will not be available for Wenger to bolster his squad until midway through next year. When asked if he had plans to make major signings in the January transfer window, Wenger kept his cards close to his chest. ""I believe the support from the board is there to spend the money if we find the players,"" he said. Another manager under pressure is Martin O'Neill, whose Sunderland team remained just a point above the relegation zone after losing 2-1 to Norwich in Sunday's only Premier League fixture. The former Aston Villa, Celtic and Leicester boss, who was a European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest as a player, was frustrated after the result left his side with just two wins from 14 games. ""We started off very tentatively -- the first goal we conceded was poor and the second was even worse,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""We should have taken something from the game. It's very frustrating to come away with nothing.""",7,9.061699773001264
7482d057fdc3da96f8d1cbd97e4c9a6a155bbde3,CNN,"(CNN) -- Syrian officials and opposition activists blamed each other for an attack on a gas pipeline near the restive city of Homs on Tuesday, while opposition groups said more than 30 people had died in new clashes. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three civilians were killed by government troops in Homs, while deserting government troops killed 18 members of the security forces in the city of Jasem. Syrian officials did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the incident, and state media did not mention it. And the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, said police and troops still loyal to President Bashar al-Assad's government killed 11 people in and around Damascus, Hama and Homs, where the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency blamed the pipeline explosion on a ""terrorist group."" CNN cannot independently confirm events inside Syria because the government restricts the activity of journalists. But activists in Homs said the government blew up the pipeline itself to distract Arab League monitors, who are in the country to try to protect civilians from violence at the hands of government security forces. ""The regime did that intentionally. They don't care about Homs; what difference does it make to them to have no power? We don't have any of the necessities: medication, heating fuel, food. And garbage is everywhere,"" said one activist. Another activist in the city of Hama said the Arab League monitors there were surrounded by Syrian officials and security forces, making it difficult for locals to speak to the observers freely. The activist said the city still has many checkpoints and security forces with heavy machine guns, and that tanks have not been withdrawn from the city -- just hidden where monitors cannot see them. The activists spoke to CNN by Skype from Syria. CNN is not naming them to protect their safety. Top U.S. and French officials also expressed doubts about whether Syria was abiding by its November agreement with the Arab League, which calls for the release of protesters jailed by the months-long crackdown on anti-government demonstrations and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from cities. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Damascus was clearly breaking its deal with its fellow Arab states. ""Across the country, the Syrian people continue to suffer at the hand of the Assad regime, as indiscriminate killing of scores of civilians continues,"" Carney said. He said it was ""past time"" for the U.N. Security Council to take action, and said Washington was working with its allies ""to increase the pressure on the Assad regime."" And U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that while some prisoners have been freed, the releases are ""nothing like what the Syrian government promised to the Arab League."" ""Our concern is that the Arab League monitors, although they are providing some ability for some demonstrators to express their views in some places, they have not led to the full implementation of the commitments that the Assad regime took on,"" Nuland told reporters in Washington. Meanwhile, she urged Syrian opposition forces to avoid attacks that would play into the government's hands. ""That's exactly what the regime wants, is to make Syria more violent and have an excuse to retaliate itself,"" Nuland said. In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told France's I-Tele on Tuesday that he was ""a little skeptical"" about whether the monitors are getting free access to the facts. ""We await their report that will be carried out in the coming days,"" Juppe said. But he added, ""I do not consider the battle already lost."" ""The secretary-general of the Arab League has expressed the will to get to the bottom of this investigation,"" he said. ""The truth must be established, and the regime cannot poison the observers who are on the ground."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday that President Bashar al-Assad must relinquish power, saying the ""massacres"" by his forces ""evoke disgust and revolt in the Arab world, in France, in Europe and everywhere in the world."" Sarkozy said nations must continue ""unrelentingly denouncing a barbaric repression and ensuring that the observers from the Arab league have the means and the freedom to carry out their work correctly."" Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby is scheduled to discuss the monitoring team's preliminary report on Saturday, an official with the organization told CNN on condition of anonymity. El-Araby is scheduled to meet with the head of the Arab Human Rights Council on Wednesday, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the press and asked not to be named. El-Araby said Monday that the killing was still going on despite the presence of his observers. ""There is still gunfire, there are still snipers, and we hope that all that will disappear,"" he said in Cairo, adding: ""There is gunfire from various directions, which makes it hard to tell who is shooting. There is no doubt that killing is ongoing, but I can't pinpoint the numbers."" Arab League observers entered Syria last week after the United Nations estimated that 5,000 people had been killed since March in an uprising against the government. Al-Assad's government says it is cracking down on armed terrorists. The Arab League aims ""to provide protection to Syrian civilians,"" el-Araby said Monday, adding that it was asking for a cease-fire and for the names of detainees in Syrian prisons. Nearly 3,500 prisoners have been freed, he said. The Arab League has placed more than 70 monitors in six cities, and the number of observers soon will exceed 100, el-Araby said.

7b3309daa28c9b0da4ad7768710a2c72253422c9,CNN,"(CNN) -- Authorities blocked U.S. Sen. Rand Paul at Nashville International Airport on Monday after the Kentucky Republican refused a pat-down at a security checkpoint, his spokeswoman said. Paul told CNN that he went through a scanner at the airport and set off an alarm. He wanted to go through the body scan again instead of getting a pat-down -- claiming that he showed Transportation Security Administration officers his knee and under his socks -- but the agents refused his request, according to the Kentucky senator. ""When an irregularity is found during the TSA screening process, it must be resolved prior to allowing a passenger to proceed to the secure area of the airport,"" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. ""Passengers who refuse to complete the screening process cannot be granted access to the secure area in order to ensure the safety of others traveling."" The senator said that he didn't think it was ""appropriate"" for him to have a pat-down, adding he should have been able to go through the scanner again. ""Is it too much to ask to have a little dignity when you travel? And shouldn't an adult be able to get back in line and go through the scanner?"" he told CNN. ""I don't think that's too much to ask."" A TSA official said Paul was ""not detained at any point"" and left the checkpoint willingly. The official was not authorized to speak for attribution. Paul said he was ""ejected"" from the screening area and told he may be subject to a ""full body search"" after he began talking on his phone. He was eventually rebooked on another Washington-bound flight, saying that time the screener did not go off when he went through it. ""It tells me that either the machines are inadequate, or they are not telling us the whole story,"" said Paul, insisting that two TSA agents told him that the screeners go off randomly -- an assertion the federal agency denies. One of the most conservative members of the Senate, Paul is an outspoken critic of what he characterizes as an overly obtrusive federal government threatening to strip citizens of various rights and civil liberties. During a Senate hearing with TSA Administrator John Pistole in November, Paul argued that the TSA policy of letting children go through the full-body scanners twice -- rather then be subjected to a pat-down -- should apply to adults as well. He predicted that with such a policy, ""you'll get rid of a lot of the anger and animosity towards the TSA."" On Monday, the senator said he also supported some sort of ""frequent traveler"" program -- so that people who travel often aren't as likely to be subject to pat-downs -- and ""selective risk assessments done on people are international travelers (and) people who have ties to groups that may be terrorists."" He added that someone in the screening area should have ""discretion"" to decide, on a case-by-case basis, if a pat-down is necessary. ""I think we've gone overboard ... I feel that our dignity is compromised, but I don't feel more safe,"" said Paul, noting he spoke with Pistole after the incident Monday. ""Regular, ordinary citizens don't need to be put through this, particularly the frequent travelers."" Rand Paul is the son of libertarian Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Ron Paul weighed in on the controversy Monday afternoon, calling it an example of a ""police state in this country"" that ""is growing out of control."" ""One of the ultimate embodiments of this (police state) is the TSA that gropes and grabs our children, our seniors, and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities,"" the congressman said in a written statement. ""The TSA does all of this while doing nothing to keep us safe."" CNN's Alan Silverleib, Aaron Cooper and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.",1,11.746521945684647
002c115c31577d0e9443794d27c2df51312858b4,CNN,"(CNN) -- With the sweltering summer bidding adieu and pleasant autumn temperatures setting in, now's the time to explore New Delhi. Travelers to the Indian capital may hesitate to try the city's famed street foods, fearing the notorious ""Delhi belly."" But skip the street food scene and you miss an essential part of the Delhi experience. Here are seven street delicacies among Delhi's endless choices, including a mix of vegetarian, non-veg and dessert. Ram laddoo . Desperate for an energy boost after a tiring shopping session? A plate of ram laddoo is your fix. Ram laddoo (""laddoo"" is a name for sweet flour balls) are savory, deep-fried moong balls served with chili-coriander sauce and garnished with grated radish. Served in silver-colored, throwaway plastic bowls, one serving of six-to-seven balls is a great power snack or even lunch. Best to try it at the make-shift ram laddoo stalls, sometimes on a bicycle, that are strewn across town. If you aren't lucky enough to see one, try it at Lajpat Nagar main market. Chaat . Sitting under a tiny tin-roofed shop in and downing deep-fried potato patties floating in a blend of yogurt, spicy green and red sauces served in leaf bowls is a definitive Delhi experience that even hardcore locals can't get enough of. Chaat is a collective term used to describe savory street dishes in India, especially these three: aloo tikki (described in the gallery above), dahi bhalla (cutlets of skinless black lentil-like gram submerged in yogurt) and papri chaat (a hybrid of aloo tikki and dahi bhalla with salty, plain biscuits thrown in). Many Delhi chaat addicts flock to a narrow alley behind the Union Public Service Commission's office near Khan Market (Humayun Road, Pandara Flats, India Gate, New Delhi, India). Prabhu Chaat Bhandar's (Dholpur House, Shahjahan Road, Khan Market, New Delhi; open daily 11 a.m.-9 p.m.) range of chaat options do the trick for a satisfying dinner. Parantha . Located in a remote corner in old Delhi's Chandni Chowk area, Paranthe Wali Gali (Lane of Paranthas) is home to some of Delhi's best-known parantha joints. The chapati's stouter, fancier cousin, parantha is a pan-fried flatbread generally stuffed with vegetables, such as mashed potato, grated cauliflower and radish. It's a popular breakfast item in Delhi's Punjabi households. Paranthe Wali Gali offers innovative parantha options. As you plonk down in one of the Gali's tiny, crammed restaurants, you'll find a number of delicious offerings: Indian rabri (sweet yogurt) parantha, mirch (red pepper) parantha, and lemon parantha (prepared from lemon zest, and probably the best this street has to offer). Samosa . Samosa is chaat's close competitor for the title of ""Definitive Delhi Street food"" title. (If there was such a thing.) It is to India, perhaps, what momo dumplings are to Tibet and bagels are to certain parts of the United States. As most people know, samosas are deep-fried, triangular pastry pockets, packed with potato, peas, lentils and sometimes meat. Although they're often served as an appetizer at Indian restaurants around the world, they can be paired with chaat for a full meal. Great places to try samosas in Delhi include Rewari Sweets (Sadar Bazar, Gurgaon, India; +91 124 232 1826; open daily 8 a.m.-8:30 p.m.) and Bengali Sweet House (27-33, Bengali Market, Connaught Place, New Delhi; +91 11 2331 9224; open daily 8 a.m.-11 p.m.). Kebabs . Traveling to Delhi and not trying the kebabs? Not done. A legacy left behind by the Mughals, who invaded India in the 16th century, the grilled meats served on skewers make the best on-the-go protein meals. You can typically choose among mutton or chicken kebabs. The Chandni Chowk and Hazrat Nizamuddin areas house some of the best kebab outlets in Delhi. If you aren't up for the large crowds in these bustling locations, you can take refuge in the more accessible Qureshi's Corner in Greater Kailash II (8, Narmada Shopping Complex, Alaknanda, New Delhi; +91 11 2602 0563; open daily 7-11 p.m.). Chola bhatura . No snack this, chola bhatura is for people with huge appetites. Fluffy, plain, flour bread combined with a chickpea curry, garnished with chopped onion and served with a tangy mango pickle, chola bhatura is a Delhi meal staple. It works both as a lunch and dinner item. Baba Nagpal Corner in Lajpat Nagar is arguably the best chola bhatura area in New Delhi. But if you find yourself in Karol Bagh or Rajouri Garden, you could hop into any of the numerous chola bhatura shops. Faluda kulfi . After consuming mouth-burning delicacies it's kulfi time. Kulfi is India's local ice cream, made with milk and a smattering of dried fruits. There are 57 varieties in all. The queen of them all is faluda kulfi (faluda is a popular rose milk flavor dessert drink with vermicelli noodles). The trusted Krishna Di Kulfi in Pandara Road Market serves kulfi with the heavenly faluda, a beverage consisting of rose milk and vermicelli.",7,7.20064122874416
aa6b1949baf50a0571200ed179f884ddaf6669cd,CNN,"(CNN) -- The teen who stunned the world of tennis Tuesday from Wimbledon's Centre Court, beating Rafael Nadal in an audacious, four-set victory laced with fun and brazen moves, has had his fairytale first Wimbledon brought to an close. Nick Kyrgios' run came to an abrupt halt Wednesday, with Milos Raonic, the No. 8 seed from Canada, disposing of the young Australian, 6-7 6-2 6-4 7-6. But the 19-year-old from Canberra's achievement will live on as one of the shocks of the tournament. To meet tennis world number one Rafael Nadal on the court at Wimbledon in his first appearance there, and to not only triumph, but to do so with an assortment of tricks, including an opening ace and a sublime between-the-legs flick that left the Spanish great dumbfounded, counts as a memorable introduction. ""Never did I think a week ago I was going to make the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in my first appearance,"" the wild-card entry, ranked 144 in the world, said in a press conference after taking this famous scalp. Heightened expectations . Until his win over Nadal, he was likely content to experience the tournament, play his Xbox -- which he brought with him from Australia -- and hang out with his father and sister, who accompanied him to London. He said he'd text his mother a smiley face after the press event ended. Now, expectations are somewhat heightened. On court, Kyrgios carries himself confidence and verve that belies his 19 years of age, as his unorthodox, Nadal-stumping shot clearly demonstrated. After besting the five-time finalist over four sets, the world has been alerted to Australian tennis' worst-kept secret, a serial winner -- and world junior number 1 -- at youth level who is taking his senior career in his stride. Many are tipping the right-handed, attacking baseliner as a future great of the game. It's not an Aussie fairytale without precedent, however. In 1996, at another Grand Slam event, a young Mark Philippoussis -- an Australian who also boasts Greek heritage -- knocked out then-number 1 Pete Sampras to reach the fourth round. ""That's what it reminded me of, where (Kyrgios) just didn't go away -- he kept going for the shots and kept coming up with the goods,"" Australian great Pat Cash told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""It was extremely impressive. It was amazing. It was almost faultless."" He started playing at six, and his background -- Greek-Australian on his father's side and Malaysian on his mother's -- is emblematic of multicultural, modern Australia, and currently divides his time between his hometown of Canberra and Melbourne, the spiritual home of Australian tennis. He's at home on grass -- something that cannot necessarily be said for his erstwhile opponent, who has endured a torrid time at Wimbledon in recent years. Becker comparison . After his phenomenal win over Nadal, comparisons are plenty, given the number of precocious talents who have graced Centre Court. But perhaps the most flattering is with the great Boris Becker, who as an unsmiling Teutonic 17-year old beat the South African Kevin Curren in the 1985 final, the first of his three Wimbledon titles. ""We keep saying 'who's the next guy?' and I think that we've found that guy,'' former Wimbledon champion and current commentator John McEnroe told the BBC. ""It was absolutely stunning, what he did to the world number 1. ""He absolutely believed that he was going to win this match, and he's acting, to me, like he can win this tournament. The last guy I saw like this... is Boris Becker. That young teenager, no fear whatsoever, no matter what comes my way I'm going to be better than them.'' McEnroe's confidence in Kyrgios' ability to go all the way may have fallen flat for now, but for a 19-year-old in his first pro season, defeating one of tennis' all-time greats still counts as a remarkable success, and he will be relishing his return to the scene in a year's time.",7,8.773329985868967
2d3d04ec86e3e896eeb63b1039bbe347178c2b4b,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed a controversial state DNA testing law to remain in effect until the justices have time to consider the broader constitutional questions. Maryland's DNA Collection Act permits police to collect genetic material from those who have been arrested, but not yet convicted. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the three-page in-chambers opinion, putting a state court's ruling favoring a criminal defendant on hold. ""Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population,"" Roberts wrote. ""Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious, and serious crimes cause serious injuries. That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm."" The chief justice said there is a ""fair prospect"" the Supreme Court would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions. After more legal briefs are filed, the high court in coming weeks will decide whether to hear the case and issue a definitive, binding ruling. Oral arguments would likely not be held until early next year. A 1994 federal law created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons, but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed. The current case involves a Maryland man convicted of a 2003 rape in Wicomico County in the state's eastern shore region. Alonzo King Jr. had been arrested three years ago on an unrelated assault charge, and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time. King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the first-degree rape offense. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals later agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon, outweighing the state's law enforcement interests. That court also said obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him, and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting. State officials then asked the justices to intervene now, saying the state court ruling ""has resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool relied upon by Maryland."" They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective, there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting ""biometric information."" Roberts in his opinion tentatively agreed. ""The (state court) decision below has direct effects beyond Maryland: Because the DNA samples Maryland collects may otherwise be eligible for the FBI's national DNA database, the decision renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government,"" Roberts wrote. The state DNA collection law in Maryland is set to expire at the end of next year, but the justices are likely to decide its constitutionality before then. The case is Maryland v. King (12A48).",1,10.533729331828553
5de722be3bf4c9bb5c8d3125e6ff881a37de9b69,CNN,"London, England (CNN) -- The British government has apologized and offered compensation to hundreds of people who suffered the effects of thalidomide, a drug once prescribed to pregnant women that later was linked to major birth defects. Thalidomide sufferers and campaigners hailed the move and said it was long overdue. British doctors prescribed thalidomide for expectant mothers from 1958 to 1962 to control the symptoms of morning sickness. The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death. Thalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims. Doctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter. There are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust. One of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs. ""It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,"" she told CNN about the government's apology. ""There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die."" Medus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled ""No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On."" Health Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a £20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older. ""The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,"" O'Brien said in the House of Commons. ""We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis."" The problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said. That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards. The Thalidomide Society, which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims, said it welcomed the government's apology. ""I think it obviously makes a great deal of difference (to the children), but I think also for the parents who had dreadful, dreadful trouble in the very early years to convince people that something had happened and it wasn't their fault,"" said society secretary Vivien Kerr. ""For them, I think, it's something to be very grateful for and it's welcome."" CNN's Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",8,6.656955473461612
a714d264d10eec8159c7ffa5074c0ddb3f117317,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter for her 2008 Democratic bid for the White House, a Clinton aide said Tuesday. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter, a Clinton aide said. All but $5 million of Clinton's funds can be spent trying to win the Democratic presidential nomination in the primaries, the aide said. More than 100,000 new donors contributed to the New York Democrat, the aide said. Clinton outpaced Sen. Barack Obama over the last three months, a reversal of positions from the second quarter. The Obama campaign announced Monday the Illinois Democrat raised at least $20 million for his presidential campaign during the third quarter.  All but about $1 million of Obama's contributions can be used in the primary fight. In the second quarter, he shattered fundraising records by reporting he raised $32.5 million, $31 million of which he can use in his bid for the Democratic nod. Clinton raised $27 million during this same period; all but $6 million can be used in the primaries. Fundraising is historically slow in the third quarter, which covers the final two months of summer and the first month of fall.  Watch how summer can be a tough time for candidates » . Campaign finance laws limit the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate during the primary cycle to $2,300. At the same time, individuals can contribute another $2,300 to a candidate for the general election. Campaigns often report the total of contributions for the primary and general cycles during a quarter, even though general election contributions can't be used immediately to buy ads or hire staff. ""Many in Washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be preordained and the primary process a mere formality,"" said Obama campaign chief David Plouffe in a veiled reference to Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polls. ""Yet, in this quarter alone, 93,000 more Americans joined our campaign, because they desire real change and believe Barack Obama is the one candidate who can deliver it,"" Plouffe said. ""This grass-roots movement for change will not be deterred by Washington conventional wisdom, because in many ways it is built to challenge it."" Obama's campaign said the senator has raised at least $74.9 million in primary funds so far this year from 352,000 donors. In a conference call Monday, John Edwards' campaign announced the former U.S. senator from North Carolina raised $7 million during the third quarter. Edwards, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee, said last week he would accept public financing for the primary and general election campaigns, challenging Clinton and Obama to do the same. Edwards' deputy campaign manager, Jonathan Prince, said the campaign has $12 million in cash. Prince said public funding will add $10 million to its totals. Edwards has raised more than $30 million so far, and the campaign is on the right track to reaching its goal of $40 million by January, Prince said. Crediting the campaign's aggressive grass-roots outreach, Prince said Edwards received donations from 150,000 Americans, with 97 percent of contributions less than $250. Edwards raised more than $9 million in the second quarter. On Sunday, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson reported campaign contributions of $5.2 million for the third quarter, which his campaign said supports his claim that he is a top-tier candidate. ""This figure obviously separates us from the second-tier candidates and makes clear this is a four-person race,"" Richardson's campaign said. Most political observers put Clinton, Obama and Edwards as the first-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination. Though $5.2 million is down from the $7 million reported in the second quarter, the Richardson campaign touted it as ""a strong showing in a historically difficult fundraising period."" ""Most importantly, this amount ensures we will have the resources we need to compete in the early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,"" it said. ""We have strong organizations in those states and continue to expand our field operations by adding staff and opening new offices."" The campaign did not disclose how much it had spent during the quarter or how much cash it had left. Candidates have until October 15 to file a full report with the Federal Election Commission. On the Republican side, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are expected to battle again for the top spot. Romney raised nearly $35 million so far this year, with Giuliani $1.5 million behind. Sources close to the Giuliani campaign said their candidate expects to be atop the pack for the third quarter. Among the GOP candidates, former Sen. Fred Thompson will have his numbers closely scrutinized. Thompson raised more than $8 million for his late-starting presidential campaign in the past three months, a Thompson campaign source said Monday. Thompson's upcoming FEC report also will show 70,000 donors have contributed to the Tennessee Republican in the third quarter, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the campaign has not officially released the information. The actor, a former ""Law & Order"" star, formally entered the presidential race last month, but he has been raising money since June. Thompson raised close to $3.5 million from about 9,000 donors in June, the final month of the second quarter. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is expected to show he raised more than $5 million this quarter, but a McCain adviser said recent poll numbers in New Hampshire and a busy fundraising schedule next month show the campaign has ""some life."" McCain raised $24.5 million the first two quarters of the year but spent nearly all of the funds raised. Lower numbers are expected for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, Sen. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. E-mail to a friend .

33d327c0ec40f9f785e8463233267ec439b904ad,CNN,"(CNN) -- A collapse on the penultimate tee of the Players Championship by Sergio Garcia allowed Tiger Woods to win the $1.7 million tournament for the second time in his career. Spain's Garcia looked to be heading into a playoff with world No. 1 Woods before hitting two tee shots into the water at the 17th hole to throw away any chance he had of winning the title he picked up in 2008. A war of words between the two players broke out on Saturday when Garcia blamed Woods for crowd noise which he claimed distracted him during his swing. It led to Garcia describing Woods as ""not the nicest guy on Tour"", but the American had the last laugh as a final round of 70 saw him finish top of the leaderboard on 13-under par, six strokes ahead of the Spaniard. ""It sounds like I was the bad guy here,"" Garcia told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I was the victim. I don't have any regrets of anything. ""That hole has been good to me for the most part,"" Garcia said of the 17th after carding a final round of 76. ""Today, it wasn't. That's the way it is. That's the kind of hole it is. You've got to love it for what it is. ""It's always nice to have a chance at beating the No. 1 player in the world, but unfortunately for me, I wasn't able to this week."" For Woods it was a fourth tournament win of the year, one which moved him onto 78 PGA Tour wins, four off Sam Snead's record of 82. ""We just go out there and play,"" said Woods, who won the Players for the first time in 2001 and took his earnings for 2013 to over $5.8m from just seven tournaments. ""I had an opportunity to win the golf tournament when I was tied for the lead, and I thought I handled the situation well and really played well when I really needed to. And that's something I'm excited about it."" Sweden's David Lingmerth, playing alongside Garcia, missed a birdie putt on the 17th which would have seen him pull level with Woods. In the end Lingmerth (72) finished 11 under in a three-way tie for second with American duo Kevin Streelman (67) and Jeff Maggert (70). Garcia was part of a seven-strong group on seven under which also included two-time major winner Rory McIlroy and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood.",7,9.664177230681128
cce97fbd8fba432bd3fce2107d81cc02cbb4fd80,CNN,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Palestinian man plowed a stolen vehicle into a Tel Aviv police checkpoint and then stabbed several people early Monday morning, Israeli police said. Seven people were injured in the attack, including one critically, officials said. The man, in his 20s and from Nablus in the West Bank, stole a taxi in Tel Aviv and drove it to a checkpoint near a popular nightclub that was hosting a large party, said Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri. After crashing the car, he got out with a knife in hand, police said. He stabbed several passersby before he was apprehended, Samri said. Four police officers and three civilians were wounded in the attack, she said. Israeli Police Commissioner Yohanan Danino said the man had planned the attack in advance. ""Tonight's event gives us additional proof that that terrorists are still motivated to carry out attacks,"" Danino told reporters. ""There was a big event being celebrated tonight with many partygoers. The Israel Border Police deployment was exceptional and prevented a great tragedy. The terrorist attack ended with a relatively light outcome."" Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it had reinforced its military presence on the southern border, south of Gaza, due to ""ongoing terror alerts."" The new Israeli security concerns follow an attack earlier this month in which a group of heavily armed gunmen attacked a series of Israeli civilian and military targets in southern Israel near the border with Egypt. Eight Israelis were killed in those attacks and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held Gaza-based militants responsible and initiated retaliatory airstrikes. Since then, Palestinian militant groups have fired dozens of rockets and mortars into southern Israel and Israel has responded with punitive airstrikes. Nearly two dozen Palestinians and an Israeli have been killed in the violence, with scores injured on both sides.",1,7.422224807876724
5263fbbd6811c915c4e4d122093304570dd23b75,CNN,"(CNN) -- I'm proud to be Ukrainian. Born in America and raised in a bilingual home, pierogies, borscht and pysanky (Ukrainian Easter eggs) were all staples in my life. So was Ukrainian school -- where I was taught history, culture, literature and grammar every Saturday morning for 13 years -- and Ukrainian scouts and Ukrainian dancing. It is nearly impossible to separate me from the culture. And I would never want that. That's what makes it so hard to see the images of escalating violence on TV among the Ukrainian people -- with whom I feel such a connection. To many of them, the protests are fueled by memories of Soviet control and fears that Russia will use its economic pressure to pull Ukraine back into its orbit. The oppression of the Soviet system is why my father fled the country 75 years ago, when he was only 18. He loved Ukraine but escaped Soviet rule to build a new life in America. Transplanting that Ukrainian identity into Parma, Ohio, was not always easy. And growing up in the Midwest, when I would tell someone I was Ukrainian, I was often met with a confused look. That was generally followed by, ""So you speak Russian?"" I can't blame them for making that assumption. After all, Ukraine was the second biggest country in the USSR. But there was no particular pride in that: Hatred of the Soviets runs deep among many Ukrainians. For my father, the flight from Ukraine -- with his two brothers, sister, father and mother -- was dangerous and difficult. He made his way to America via Germany during World War II. He survived the bombing of Dresden, and his family got separated. They eventually found each other once they all landed safely in the United States, but for a frightened interval, they had no idea whether the others were alive or dead. My sister, brother and I grew up riveted by my father's and uncle's stories about dodging the authorities to escape. My father told of avoiding soldiers as he walked among the dead after the bombing in Dresden; they had shoot-to-kill orders for anyone who might be looting. It was like listening to a live thriller or spy novel. My father may not have spoken English when he arrived in America, but he was determined. He mastered the language and went on to become a chief financial officer of Cardinal Federal Savings & Loan in Cleveland. He dreamed of the day Ukraine would become independent, as did my mother -- a Ukrainian born in America. Both died before they could see it. But I saw it. And in 1992, I traveled to the country on a Teach English program sponsored by a Ukrainian organization. It was a time when Ukraine was like the Wild West. The country had just elected a new president and was newly independent -- but many didn't really know what that meant. When I arrived in Kiev, I assumed everyone would speak Ukrainian and that I would fit right in. I was mistaken, as many spoke Russian. More alarming to me was when I realized I didn't know who to ask for help in finding a telephone. In America, it was easy. You just ask a cop. In Ukraine, there were many different uniforms -- not so easy. (Hint: Ask the old lady, or babushka -- works every time.) One thing was crystal clear: There was a thirst for the West. After years of oppression, my students wanted to learn everything they could from me about America. One young girl even said her dream was to go to Disneyland (whose isn't?) As a ""homeland journey,"" for me it was at times a surreal experience. I was suddenly seeing all the things I had only learned about in books. (Swimming in the Black Sea was not something you just dreamed about in Ukrainian school!) Even more precious was when my sister and I traveled to Ivano-Frankivsk, the city of my family. My sister and I saw the school where our grandfather taught and the pond where our father and his siblings went skating. That my father and his family could leave such a place -- leave behind everything they knew -- and make a courageous leap of faith into a new country where they could not even speak the language filled me with admiration. I have never felt more grateful to them for making that trek as when I met some local Ukrainians who said they wished their families had done what mine did. That's when it really hit me that I could leave that country, but their lives were going to be much more difficult. As I watch the violent and deadly protests from afar, I think now about all these people. I see in the Ukrainians locked in confrontation the same national pride with which I was raised. They no longer want to leave. They want to have a strong independent nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Tymkiw.",4,11.732377182189351
e7b86df951940529e60df6c857adfa3f60197965,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Italian and French governments were both trying to defuse an escalating diplomatic row Monday after France refused entry to a train carrying North African migrants from Italy. Italy complained to France on Sunday after authorities blocked a train with Tunisian migrants from the border city of Ventimiglia entering Menton on the Cote d'Azur. The Tunisians had been issued resident permits by Italy, allowing them to travel freely in many European countries. French Interior Minister Claude Gueant said Monday in Bucharest that France did not want any continuing tensions with Rome regarding the train incident. Gueant said Rome's decision to give temporary resident permits to more than  25,000 Tunisian migrants arriving in Italy since January had been ""heavily contested by many countries in the European Union."" Some 300 French and Italian protestors from a group named ""Train for dignity,"" were also aboard the train in a show of support for the 60 Tunisians who were hoping to enter France. Gueant said that although France accepted this decision, there were conditions - namely that the migrants had to prove they could support themselves financially. Since the mass political unrest started in North Africa and other Arab states in January, a large number people have fled Tunisia and Libya to Europe, where governments have been trying to prevent a refugee crisis. Italy's coast guard said at least 1,623 migrants landed on the island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period in mid-March alone. Italy's foreign minister has estimated that as many as 300,000 Libyans could try to leave and could potentially end up in his country. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata in Libya and on Monday the UK Department for International Development (DFID) said that it would help 5,000 migrants trapped by fighting in western Libya. The DFID said £1.5 million ($2.43 million) would be made available to charter ships to get people out of the rebel-held town of Misrata and transfer them to Benghazi. Andrew Mitchell, the UK International Development Secretary, said his department would help fund their evacuation in ships chartered by the International Organization for Migration, which says the majority of unauthorized immigrants arriving in Lampedusa are Tunisian. Italy for its part has issued temporary resident permits to thousands of Tunisian migrants and the country on Sunday said it was angered after trains were stopped at the border for around six hours until traffic resumed later that evening. However, at a briefing with journalists Monday, a spokesman for the Italian Foreign Minister Maurizio Massari, tried to play down the issue: ""The situation was clarified and the incident resolved yesterday (Sunday). On the immigration issue, there is a continuous dialogue taking place between the Interior Ministers of the two countries to deal with the problem. We are working together. There is no tension. We are working together to find steps to take to solve the immigration problem.' According to a spokesman for the French Interior Ministry the border was never closed but circulation was ""temporarily halted in order to avoid any risk of an accident,"" because of an unauthorized protest in support of the Tunisian migrants. Claude Gueant insisted that France had respected the Schengen agreements to the letter and a first analysis by the European commission on Monday showed that France's decision to stop the trains was in line with the Schengen rules. The Schengen agreement allows people to travel between 25 European countries without the need of a passport.

bd929c094f85cd6abbfd395f1eaa8905f5fce652,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Movie director John Landis is suing Michael Jackson, accusing the reclusive entertainer of fraud in his handling of profits from the iconic ""Thriller"" video the two made together more than 25 years ago. ""King of Pop"" Michael Jackson, seen in 2005, made the ""Thriller"" video with John Landis more than 25 years ago. Landis claimed his 1983 contract with Jackson gave him 50 percent of net profits from the 14-minute video and the documentary about the making of it, both works that he directed and co-wrote with Jackson, court documents say. Jackson ""wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits,"" the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says. The suit characterizes Optimum as ""a defunct corporation"" Jackson has used as an alter ego. The suit accuses Jackson of ""concealing the extent of net profits"" by not giving an annual accounting for at least the past four years, and maintains that Jackson is ""guilty of fraudulent, malicious and oppressive conduct."" Jackson's lawyers have not responded to the suit, which was filed on January 21. The video was based on Jackson's 1982 album by the same name, one of the top-selling of all time. Landis, best known as director of ""Animal House"" and ""An American Werewolf in London,"" made the song into a short horror movie, complete with Vincent Price adding narration. Word of the suit comes just after an announcement that Jackson has signed a deal to take the dancing zombie story to the Broadway stage. The Nederlander Organization, a Broadway production company, announced Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Jackson to produce ""Thriller"" on stage. The show, which Jackson is to be involved with, also is to include music from other Jackson albums, the company said. The court has set May 11 as the date for lawyers to hold a conference with a judge concerning the lawsuit.",4,13.530514020270635
ff2f5d8984853e45584a629ceedb2f98b7d9d01b,CNN,"Dallas (CNN) -- A federal judge has blocked key parts of a Texas law that would require doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion, days before the law was set to take effect. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, in Austin, Texas, found that several portions of the law are ""unconstitutionally vague,"" and that it violates the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech. As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure. It was to take effect on September 1. The preliminary injunction, issued Tuesday, blocks the state from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who does not place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them, or does not make the heartbeat audible. It also blocks penalties against the woman. ""Today's ruling is a huge victory for women in Texas and a clear signal to the state legislature that it went too far when it passed this law,"" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""Politicians have no business telling doctors how to practice medicine or meddling in women's private medical decisions."" The Center filed the lawsuit, which was granted class-actions status. Texas Gov. and Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry said the state would appeal the decision. ""Every life lost to abortion is a tragedy and (the) ruling is a great disappointment to all Texans who stand in defense of life,"" he said in a statement. ""This important sonogram legislation ensures that every Texas woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying, and understands the devastating impact of such a life-changing decision."" The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, ""in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,"" the law states. In his order, Sparks agreed with the abortion providers that many clauses in the law were too vague. He wrote, ""The court is inclined to agree with (the) defendants' characterization that (the) ""plaintiffs have chosen to throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks."" The court also found that the sonogram law goes beyond existing informed consent laws regarding abortion and constituted a violation of the First Amendment. The law ""compels physicians to advance an ideological agenda with which they may not agree, regardless of any medical necessity, and irrespective of whether the pregnant women wish to listen,"" Sparks wrote.",8,10.24071124987295
c294a072f0ed50b827565bd37ff44c151a0aa415,CNN,"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese company trying to contain the release of radiation from its Fukushima nuclear plant must pour enough water to cool its damaged reactors without creating an overflow of contaminated water from the plant, a government official said Tuesday. Yukio Edano, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary and the government's point man for the nation's nuclear crisis, said the effort to prevent the reactors from overheating ""must be given priority."" But Edano acknowledge the danger posed by continuing to pour water into them. ""If we need to increase water injection, this is what we need to do.  If we stop water injection, fuel rod temperatures may increase and that may result in overheating,"" Edano said.  ""But fundamentally we need to drain the water as soon as possible."" Edano's remarks came a day after he told reporters that the containment structure surrounding one of the reactors at a quake-battered nuclear power plant is damaged and may be leaking radioactive material. The plant's owner disclosed that small amounts of plutonium had been found among contaminants around the facility late Monday as Japanese authorities struggled to explain how radioactive water was leaking into maintenance tunnels and possibly, into the Pacific Ocean. Edano told reporters Monday afternoon that ""there may be a leak"" from the containment vessel surrounding the No. 2 reactor. He said experts were still trying to determine the condition of the reactor's pressure vessel, which sits inside the containment vessel and immediately surrounds the radioactive fuel rods at the reactor's core. ""Somehow, we understand water is being moved from one place to another,"" Edano said. ""We need to hear an explanation from experts."" Reactors 1 to 3 at the plant, located about 240 kilometers (140 miles) north of Tokyo, are believed to have suffered core damage after their cooling systems were knocked out by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan. The tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, forcing workers to scramble to prevent a meltdown. Technicians restored external electric power late Monday to the No. 3 reactor plant, a step toward restoring cooling systems there, the plant's owner reported late Monday. But hydrogen explosions -- an early symptom of core damage -- inflicted heavy damage on the buildings housing the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in the days following the quake, and another suspected explosion rocked the No. 2 reactor on March 15. Japanese nuclear regulators and the owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, say they know little about what damage was sustained in that blast. Tokyo Electric announced late Monday that plutonium -- a reactor byproduct that is also part of the fuel mix in the No. 3 reactor -- had turned up in soil on the plant grounds in tests taken last week. However, the company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on Japan following above-ground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades, and posed no health risk to humans. ""Just in case, TEPCO will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment,"" the company said. Three plutonium isotopes -- Pu-238, -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds, Tokyo Electric reported. The element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested, but external exposure poses little health risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant, which has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern Japan. Water found in a maintenance tunnel leading to unit No. 2's turbine house remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard, authorities reported after taking new readings Monday afternoon. The 1,000 millisievert per hour reading is more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30 percent higher risk of cancer, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The level is also four times the top dose Japan's Health Ministry has set for emergency workers struggling to control the further emission of radioactive material from the damaged plant. Cham Dallas, an expert on radiation and public health at the University of Georgia, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the level suggests operators are facing ""a deteriorating situation"" at the No. 2 reactor. ""Fortunately, that's in the reactor area, not outside and not in Tokyo or even in the area in Fukushima province,"" Dallas said. ""But in the reactor area itself, that's -- that's concerning to me. We're starting to see levels now that are dangerous to reactor workers if they're in those contaminated areas."" The officials said it was unclear how contaminated water got into the tunnel, or if it might have spilled out and seeped into the Pacific Ocean from there. ""Right now, it is not known,"" Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said  Monday evening. Water was being pumped out of the No. 1 and No. 2 turbine building, but Nishiyama noted that there is no place to put water pooled in the No. 2 building's basement. The plan is to extract the water using what he called a condenser. But that apparatus is ""almost full,"" as are several storage tanks nearby. A similar challenge is holding up the removal of collected water in the No. 3 unit's turbine building basement. ""So we will first have to empty some of the tanks,"" he said, adding later only that the tainted water needs to be removed ""as soon as possible."" Seawater readings from a monitoring post 330 meters (361 yards) into the Pacific Ocean showed elevated readings of the reactor byproduct iodine-131, an isotope that loses half its radioactivity every eight days. The measurement was taken north of the discharge canal for reactors 1-4, where a reading of 1,850 times normal was recorded Sunday. And despite reduced alarms in recent days, Nishiyama noted Monday that the temperature is rising inside the No. 1 reactor -- a sign that the nuclear fuel rods in that unit remain in danger of overheating. Units 1, 2 and 3 were the only three of the six reactors operating when the magnitude 9 earthquake struck. The quake and resulting tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, leaving authorities scrambling to pump water into the reactors and the spent fuel pools to prevent a meltdown. Authorities have switched from pumping seawater into the reactors to using fresh water, and plan to switch from seawater to fresh water in the spent fuel pools, where old fuel rods are stored. Monday was the 32nd anniversary of the worst U.S. nuclear accident, a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Though no deaths or injuries resulted, the accident hamstrung the American atomic power industry for decades. CNN's Whitney Hurst contributed to this report .",2,8.173684312443294
f36367ecb1837059019094c00232a2a06c17883b,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- For most divers, a shark in the water can inspire fear, or even dread. Greg Marshall wanted to hitch a ride. More specifically, Marshall was inspired by the shark's constant companion, a remora -- a torpedo-shaped fish that commonly catches a ride by sucking onto the shark's rough skin and thriving on the shark's leftovers. Marshall thought to himself: What if you had a camera as small as a remora? What if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life, unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits? Where would it go, and what would you see? For a naturalist, being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard. In scientific terms, it's similar to a control in an experiment. But that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity, for example, is no indication of how an animal actually behaves. Observing that behavior in the wild, Marshall says, is equally problematic. ""When we're in an animal's habitat, they know we're there,"" he says. ""And they're reacting to us."" And knowledge of an animal's actual behavior, Marshall says, is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature's habitat and behavior, and how humans may be disrupting both. Of course, the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation, or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car. Or you can see what the animal sees, courtesy of ""Crittercam."" Twenty-five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off Belize, Marshall and his far-flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard. Technology may finally be catching up with inspiration. Marshall took his initial ideas for ride-along observation technology to the National Geographic Society in 1987. Now he's vice president of the society's Remote Imaging division -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild, away from the interference of the observers. ""Crittercam enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along, almost completely unobtrusively, to see their world and their behavior,"" he says. Marshall is a real-deal explorer, a tall, lanky, gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the Sea of Cortez or a snowmobile in Antarctica than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the National Geographic Society. Marshall still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview, he was off to Antarctica, again. But more often he's back in Washington, at his desk or in an edit bay. Still, adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes, it's in the most unlikely of places. Cracking open a newly recovered Crittercam remora (or box, or sphere, or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto-unwitnessed moments in nature) is, for Marshall, full of the rush of exploration. When Crittercam got its start, the results of all the hard work came down to a small, fragile tape. Nowadays, the data is stored on a tough, solid-state memory card. But seeing the data of the first time, Marshall says, is always a rush. ""You start looking at the screen because you never know what you're going to see. It's completely engaging and captivating,"" he says. The results, Marshall says, run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least, boring to a typical National Geographic Channel viewer. But to a marine biologist like Marshall, even the ""boring"" stuff can have stop-in-your-tracks potential. Case in point: Sperm whales. They are one of the deepest-diving species on the planet. Years ago, his crew successfully attached an advanced Crittercam to a diving sperm whale. ""The first 10 seconds are fascinating, because you see the whale diving down,"" Marshall says. ""And then it dives down into utter darkness. And then we're looking at a black screen for the next two hours."" But that Crittercam was also equipped to record sound, as well as video. And in that utter blackness (sperm whales can dive almost two miles down), the Crittercam whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful, rapid-fire clicks. That whale conversation kept Marshall and his editors transfixed. It wasn't a made-for-TV moment, but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the Crittercam system can reap unexpected rewards. In the frigid waters off Alaska, a Crittercam captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing. There's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo (yes, there's a kangaroo that climbs trees) high in the jungle canopy of New Guinea. A sea lion in Australia plays with its food -- in this case, a hapless octopus. There's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye-popping speed, chasing an equally quick seal. ""You just never know what you're going to get -- it's just completely engaging,"" he says with a broad grin. Crittercam footage finds its way into many of National Geographic's nature programs. And the best Crittercam moments are a rare combination of good television and good science. That's partly the goal of the whole program, Marshall says. ""I want to find a way to connect with people, I want to find a way to make them care about the conservation problem,"" Marshall says. ""Imagine a planet where there are no humpback whales, where there are no blue whales, no leopard seals, no leatherback turtles. Can we survive? Absolutely we can survive... Well, probably. ""Is it going to be the kind of place we're going to revel in, that's going to inspire us? I doubt it. As we know more, we're going to care more -- and as we care more, we're going to protect these animals and the habitats they depend on.""",3,5.493055863365778

Giffords' spokesman, Mark Kimble, said Monday that the Arizona Democrat ""has not yet decided whether she will participate in an on-camera interview."" ""She will make that decision based on her progress,"" Kimble said. Her husband, Mark Kelly, ""will do an on-camera interview with Diane Sawyer,"" the spokesman added.

a81c54eff9b21dc009e2b5af464374c07ac01396,CNN,"(CNN) -- If Vladimir Putin wanted to get America's attention, he's done a pretty good job. The Russian president's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in Syria, published on The New York Times' website late Wednesday, set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged, some impressed, and some just plain bemused. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""insulted."" Putin said he wrote the article ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders."" But he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of American exceptionalism. It was a reference to President Barack Obama's address on Tuesday night, in which he said that while America can't be a global cop, it ought to act when in certain situations. ""That's what makes us exceptional,"" Obama said. ""With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" Putin's answer to that? ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" he wrote. World reaction . He concluded with the line, ""We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."" The White House shrugged off the fuss around Putin's jabs at Obama, describing them as ""irrelevant."" Obama himself ignored a question about the op-ed on Thursday. His chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Putin has a right to his opinion, noting that America is an exceptional nation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned Putin's views on equality. ""What I found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to God he judges us all - I don't know exactly what his words are but he says `we are all God's children.' I think that's great. I hope it applies to gays and lesbians in Russia as well,"" Pelosi said. Putin signed a law earlier this year that bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported. 'Hey Putin' There are others who took issue with Putin's view. ""Hey Putin, next time you wanna write a letter to convince America about something, how about you skip saying we're not exceptional? #rude,"" tweeted Sarah Rumpf, a political consultant in Texas. Is the U.S. really No. 1? Russia's wars . The Russian president also annoyed some people by warning against military action without U.N. Security Council approval. ""Man who launched military action in Georgia and Chechnya without UN say-so says wars without it are illegal?"" tweeted the journalist John Podhoretz. A report commissioned by the European Union said that Georgia illegally started the war with Russia in 2008 but that the Russian response, which involved occupying large parts of Georgian territory, also violated international law. The two wars between Russian forces and separatists in Chechnya are widely considered to be internal conflicts. Some Twitter users unearthed a previous op-ed that Putin wrote for the Times about the Chechen war in 1999. Putin, then the prime minister of Russia, struck a different tone in which he sought to explain Russia's military action. ""No government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes,"" he wrote. ""It is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger."" ""Not a word on UN or Pope or Int'l law,"" Philip Gourevitch, a staff writer at The New Yorker, commented about the 1999 article. (Putin mentions the pope in his op-ed this week as being among those opposed to a U.S. strike against Syria.) Senator's stomach turns . The overall tone of Putin's latest broadside was too much for Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday. ""I almost wanted to vomit,"" he said. ""I worry when someone who came up through the KGB tells us what is in our national interests and what is not. It really raises the question of how serious the Russian proposal is."" But plenty of people seemed to think Putin had scored points against Obama. ""I think it's sad to see him acting with more common sense and humanity than Obama,"" said Ashton Blazer. ""Putin made a compelling, though disingenuous, case against military strikes. Its effectiveness shows how badly Pres Obama was outmaneuvered,"" tweeted Marc Lamont Hill. Power plays . Others saw it in less subtle terms. ""#Putin diplomatically serves it to Pres. Obama in the last paragraph. Can't believe the #nytimes ran this,"" wrote Mary F. Mueller. For some people, the tension between the two presidents has become a spectacle in its own right. ""Putin plays his next move on our very own NYTimes. This is almost getting as good as Breaking Bad,"" wrote Twitter user @MiketheEye. Others said the tone of the article brought to mind some of the famous photos of Putin in macho poses. ""Putin wrote his Times op-ed on an Underwood, shirtless, with hunting knife nearby,"" joked Chris Regan.",1,9.47507250846373
776a351436a3f1dd5b0f7d2df7700dc36cbb05b5,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Billings, Montana, City Council will take up the issue of regulating medical marijuana on Monday night in a meeting expected to be intense in the wake of the firebombings of two of the city's medical marijuana storefronts in the last two days. The southern Montana city's dispensaries legally provide marijuana to medical patients who use it for maladies from glaucoma to nausea to lack of appetite. In the latest incidents, the phrase ""Not in our town"" was spray-painted on the businesses, police say. Police Sgt. Kevin Iffland said Big Sky Patient Care was hit early Sunday morning and Montana Therapeutics was the target early Monday. Both had a rock thrown through the front door, followed by a Molotov cocktail. In both cases, Iffland said, the fire was put out swiftly and damage was not extensive. Iffland said Billings police are working with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and that the two firebombs are being handled as felony arsons carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The attacks on the storefronts come as the Billings City Council considers a moratorium on licensing new dispensaries while it works up a regulatory ordinance. Sixty-two percent of Montanans voted in 2004 to allow caregivers to grow marijuana for qualified patients, but the state law said nothing about distribution. In that absence, municipalities and county governments began licensing the establishments on their own. But, Iffland said, Billings was ill-prepared for the number of applications and has very little regulation in place. Billings, he said, is a town of about 100,000 and has had nearly 90 applications for medical marijuana storefronts -- and some residents are angry. He fully expected a heated council meeting. Meanwhile, investigators are still reviewing evidence in the firebombings and are working with one of the businesses that has surveillance video but is reluctant to hand over the tape because of privacy concerns. While the investigation is ongoing, police have stepped up patrols in the areas where the medical marijuana storefronts are located, Iffland said.",8,10.109002369533606
2a39758b29734987a91baee7f2742778535bb688,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tom Cruise's latest movie may be just the ""Edge"" the actor needs. Since 2011's ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" -- his last feature to cross the $100 million mark at the domestic box office -- the 51-year-old has had a spotty track record. The 2012 comedy ""Rock of Ages"" and the 2013 sci-fi drama ""Oblivion"" were both mildly received by audiences and film critics, while his 2012 outing as Lee Child's imposing Jack Reacher didn't fare much better. But with Friday's ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" critics are placing their bets on Cruise. Directed by Doug Liman, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" stars Cruise as a military PR rep who finds himself thrown into a battle against an alien invasion. Cruise's character swiftly dies, only to find himself in a sort of time loop that causes him to come back to life. Yet every time Cruise's Maj. William Cage returns to the land of the living, he is acquiring more skills to help him stay alive and potentially reach victory. The person helping him navigate the war zone is Emily Blunt's warrior-like soldier Rita Vrataski. The plot might sound convoluted -- it's based on the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill,"" and has elicited more than one comparison to ""Groundhog Day"" -- but the movie has received largely positive reviews. ""Just when you were ready to give up on the summer season and its cookie-cutter, been-there blockbusters, 'Edge of Tomorrow' saves the day,"" raves the Los Angeles Times. ""It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions."" Part of the movie's fresh appeal is its casting of Cruise as the guy who doesn't want to dive right into the action. As The New York Times' Manohla Dargis points out, we've become used to seeing Cruise walk on screen fully equipped as the grim action hero, and his ""Edge of Tomorrow"" role is essentially the antithesis of that. ""(W)atching him glide through the opening of 'Edge of Tomorrow' ... it's hard not to think, 'Where has this guy been?'"" Dargis writes. ""It's been years since Mr. Cruise felt this light on screen."" Blunt as his co-star is no slouch, either. USA Today calls her Cruise's ""action-hero equal,"" making ""Edge of Tomorrow"" ""better for it"" -- and, as a whole, Time's Richard Corliss was impressed. ""A furiously time-looping joy ride, (it's) the smartest action film of the early summer season,"" Corliss says in his review. ""The movie's only static element is its title, which oddly suggests a mashup of TV soap operas."" (Well, unless you count the tedium that can set in from watching Cruise ""live, die and repeat"" over and over again, as The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy warns.) But, as any studio head can tell you, good buzz is just half the battle in building a summer blockbuster. And with heady competition from ""The Fault In Our Stars,"" Variety's Brent Lang is predicting the teen romance will hold back ""Edge of Tomorrow"" at the box office. If Cruise doesn't re-emerge as box office king, he can at least rest easy knowing he's won over several critics once again. ""(G)ive Cruise credit,"" says Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty. ""Not only is he hard-headed enough to get right back on the horse that bucked him, but he manages to show us why he still matters as a movie star.""",6,11.734131090637366
086064866d475145522ece823f959a5754f1cb7e,CNN,"(CNN) -- Retirement hasn't been full of lazy days, rounds of golf and luxury vacations for Gary Terry. When this former telecommunications executive called it quits after a 32-year career, he took up an equally time-consuming volunteer job as chairman of the American Heart Association's Texas chapter. Gary Terry says his being saved by a public defibrillator he'd pressed for was ""divine intervention."" ""I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group,"" said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas. But his ""sign from the Lord"" came, not in the form of a dream or a mysterious figure in his morning toast. Instead, it came in the form of a cardiac arrest by the security checkpoint at the Austin airport. ""I was trying to get back to the metroplex because I had a meeting the next morning. I reached down to pick up my briefcase, and I kept going."" Here's where the story takes an ironic twist: Gary Terry collapsed just 18 feet from an automated external defibrillator AED that he and his group -- the American Heart Association -- helped to install just eight months earlier. ""A lot of people say there's a lot of circumstances in your situation that really are unique,"" said Terry, ""and I say no, they're not unique circumstances -- they're divine intervention. And I truly believe that."" But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.  Watch more on the heart official saved by a defibrillator he pushed for » . ""When somebody stops breathing and they hit the ground, for all intents and purposes, they're dead,"" says Dr. Art Kellermann, noted defibrillator advocate and professor of emergency medicine  at Emory University. ""There are a few minutes where you can reach through the door and pull them back from death if you act decisively."" And acting decisively, says Kellermann, means following the four links in the ""chain of survival."" Visit CNNhealth, your connection for better living . The first link, according to the American Heart Association, is to recognize there's a problem, and call 911. Next, begin doing CPR, employ the use of a defibrillator and get the victim into the hands of capable medical professionals like the paramedics. ""Research has shown time and time again that you win or lose in a cardiac arrest on the scene,"" says Dr. Kellermann. ""If you don't get [the victim] started before you start transport, the likelihood they'll survive to leave the hospital is less than one-half of 1 percent."" And statistics also show that if the chain of survival is initiated within 4 minutes, the chances of survival can be as high as 60 percent. The good news is, CPR is easy to learn (local classes can be found here) and the automated external defibrillator is remarkably simple to use, even without significant training. According to several device manufacturers, you simply place the pads on a victim's chest, and turn the unit on. Complex algorithms inside the unit's computer determine whether a shock from the machine will help restart a victim's heart. Once the machine determines that a shock should in fact be delivered, it tells the user to clear their hands from the patient's body, and press the ""shock"" button. It's far less complicated than your average VCR, and almost impossible to screw up. It's for these reasons, and the relatively low cost of a defibrillator that Gary Terry continues his crusade. ""I think this is part of the plan, and I think he wants me to keep telling people what a great piece of equipment the AED is."" And Terry says he won't stop until the defibrillator is as ubiquitous in public places as a sprinkler system. ""I'm gonna try to put AEDs in every building and in every house, and then I'm gonna hang them on trees.""",5,11.9442067333638
152303728eee8993846b9ecc7a77ae3b8a16c48c,CNN,"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- Schools throughout the small town of Chardon, Ohio, will be closed Tuesday -- except for counselors on hand to help any students who want to come in to talk, to try to come to grips with the bloodshed that left one of their own dead. Four students, meanwhile, spent the night in local hospitals for gunshot wounds -- two in critical condition at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, and one in serious condition and another in stable condition at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Chardon police Chief Police Chief Tim McKenna said late Monday afternoon. They all had been in the Chardon High School cafeteria on Monday morning, when two witnesses saw another student they later identified as T.J. Lane walk up to a table and start firing. ""He was silent the entire time,"" said Nate Mueller, who was just a few feet away from the shooter. ""There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire."" A teacher identified by students as Frank Hall helped chase the gunman out of the school. Police arrested the suspect -- whom they have not named, except to say he's a juvenile -- nearby a short time later. One of Lane's friends, Haley Kovacik, said she was in ""complete shock"" that Lane -- whom she described as a ""a very normal, just teenage boy"" -- could be responsible for the mayhem. ""He did have a sad look in his eyes a lot of the time, but he talked normally (and) he never said anything strange,"" Kovacik told CNN. ""It is a really big shock."" Another friend, Torilyn LaCasse, saw Lane being picked on regularly at school and said he put a wall around himself, reluctant especially to share anything about his personal life. One glimpse into his mindset may have come December 30, when Lane posted a long, poetic rant on his Facebook page centered ""in a quaint lonely town, (where there) sits a man with a frown (who) longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet."" ""He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain,"" he said, later thanking those who ""liked"" the post and saying he'd written it in class one day. He concluded the post by writing, ""Die, all of you."" A student at Chardon High, Evan Erasmus, said the victims were students who attended a nearby vocational school, and were waiting for a bus to take them there. Lane himself is a student at the Lake Academy Alternative School, said the school's interim director, Don Ehas. The student killed in Monday's shooting was identified by his family as Daniel Parmertor. ""Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him. The family is torn by this loss,"" the family said in a statement released by MetroHealth Medical Center. Gov. John Kasich ordered flags to be flown at half-staff Tuesday at the Ohio Statehouse, as well as throughout Geauga County, in honor of Parmetor. Why he was killed remains a mystery, as school and law enforcement authorities have not offered details as to the suspect's motive. ""I just can't believe it. I don't think it's real,"" said student Danny Komertz, who witnessed the shooting. ""And I just, it kills me that I saw someone hiding, and now that someone is now dead."" Komertz said he heard a pop as he was walking with friends. He looked up to see a boy he did not recognize holding a gun, pointing it at a group of four students. ""He just fired two quick shots at them,"" said Komertz, a freshman. ""I saw one student fall, and I saw the other hiding, trying to get cover underneath the table."" Komertz said he started to run when he saw the gun, but heard a total of five shots. Multiple calls reporting a shooting flooded into the police dispatch center beginning at 7:38 a.m., McKenna said. Around that time, student Evan Erasmus said, he had just arrived for his English class when an administrator ""yelled 'lockdown!'"" over the announcements. ""All of a sudden, all the doors started slamming. You could hear them slam,"" Erasmus said. ""And we all turned off the lights, and we headed towards the corner."" After police got word from a dispatcher that a teacher had chased the suspect out of the school, officers went inside, soon followed by paramedics to help the injured students, McKenna said. Neil Thomas, who was in his Spanish class at the time of the shooting, said the actions of teacher Frank Hall, the assistant football coach who is thought to have chased the gunman from the school, were very much in character. ""Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone,"" Thomas said. ""And today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us, that he would take a bullet for us."" It was unclear exactly how the suspect was captured. Initial reports from police indicated that he may have turned himself in to bystanders, but McKenna did not mention that. Instead, he said officers ""came up with the suspect"" after starting a search shortly after the shooting. As investigators took over the school, students were evacuated to nearby Maple Elementary School, said Lt. John Hiscox of the sheriff's office. Local officials, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and several students credited frequent lockdown drills and the quick response of school authorities for helping keep the situation from becoming worse. The Chardon High shooting was the latest, but hardly the only mass shooting in recent years on school campuses. In addition to several at universities, including an April 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead, the bloodiest attack on a high school campus was when teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at Colorado's Columbine High in 1999. Hours after calling off school Monday, Chardon school superintendent Joseph Bergant said there would be no class on Tuesday -- though counselors will be on hand at Chardon Middle School and St. Mary Chardon School, which is alongside the church in which a candlelight vigil is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, according to the superintendent. ""I hope that every parent, if you haven't hugged or kissed your family in the last couple of days, take that time,"" Bergant said.

09110ebd3d4d58be994faa606c624601aba6540b,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- New documents made public this week about possible Secret Service misconduct include allegations of sexual abuse, domestic violence, drunken behavior and guns being accidentally discharged. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released on Thursday logs of reports to its hotline dating to 2004. The documents were made public while the office investigates reports of sexual misconduct by Secret Service personnel with prostitutes in Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena this spring. Many of the items are blacked out to redact names and other information, and in numerous instances it's not possible to determine if the complaints were credible or if any action was taken. In one report dated August 23, 2011, a Secret Service employee said that during a work trip another employee pushed her onto a bed, got on top of her and tried to engage in sex. The woman said she told the agent ""no"" several times and was able to push him off of her. The log says supervisors viewed the employee who complained of the assault as""conscientious and dependable."" Her report was investigated and the matter was ended in February with some kind of ""administrative disposition"" which was not specified. All the names were redacted. Another allegation made October 23, 2003, said that an agent forced a female acquaintance to have non-consensual sex with him at a hotel in Killeen, Texas. The case was closed in January 2005 and there is a notation saying ""allegation not substantiated."" That same month, an anonymous person reported that the FBI was investigating whether an agent was involved in a prostitution ring. The allegation was that FBI wiretaps recorded calls from two phones and the numbers traced back to the unidentified agent. According to the log note, the agent said he got a phone number ""from a woman handing out fliers on the street and called it out of curiosity."" The agent retired. A redacted October 7, 2010, entry with no specifics says there was a report a Secret Service employee might have been involved in the leak of national security information. The case appears to still be open. A number of reports concern off-duty Secret Service personnel being arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol or for alleged domestic violence. There are also incidents of misfiring guns while on the job, including a September 26, 2007, log note that an agent accidentally discharged one round from a submachine gun while on temporary assignment in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. A Secret Service spokesman described the material as an intake log covering eight years with items that either mention the Secret Service or concern matters that have been referred to the law enforcement agency. ""The vast majority did not involve alleged misconduct by Secret Service agents or officers,"" said spokesman Edwin Donovan. Bill Hillburg, a spokesman for the Office of Inspector General agreed that only a small number of the reports dealt with allegations against the Secret Service. ""None of it is related to our investigation of Secret Service behavior in Cartagena,"" Hillburg said. He said all the hotline reports were noted and passed on to the Secret Service. Hillburg added that the hotline number is well-advertised to the public. The DHS released the 229 pages of log notes as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request by news media. Dozens of entries concern such things as Nigerian fraud schemes. Some items discuss possible terror concerns or threats against presidents. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who co-chairs the committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a statement reacting to the logs. ""While some of the allegations proved to be unfounded or frivolous, others appear to be legitimate, and that adds to my concern about apparent misconduct by some of the personnel of this vital law enforcement agency,"" said Collins, whose committee is investigating the Colombia incident. Collins added that in her committee's hearing last month, it was revealed there have been 64 allegations of sexual misconduct by Secret Service employees over the past five years. One of those included a 2008 case in which an employee solicited a prostitute who was actually an undercover police officer. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan testified before Collins and other members of the committee last month that the behavior by employees in Colombia was the result of poor choices by a dozen agents who were drinking heavily. ""This is not a cultural issue,"" he said. The April scandal led to nine Secret Service members losing their jobs. Three others were cleared of serious misconduct. A dozen members of the military were also involved. Collins told Sullivan at that hearing, ""I continue to believe that the problem is broader than you believe it to be.""",3,6.240278142768036
11741909480ff60de5ef7aa267e3cd0a8a7bc2af,CNN,"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Since the Democrats chose to host their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a state that has not been hospitable to unions, organized labor is going to have a rally to focus attention on its key issues in Philadelphia on August 11. The rally is meant to send a message to the Democratic leadership, as well as to Republicans, that many workers feel as if they don't have a voice in the two-party system. As AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka said to members, the rally will ""give us an opportunity to connect the faces of ordinary Americans to the basic issues affecting working people in our country while providing an important liftoff to our Labor 2012 political program for the fall."" The rally is indicative of a larger tension that has plagued the Democratic coalition for several decades. Since the 1960s, organized labor, once the pillar of the Democratic Party, has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility. Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for 2nd straight day . Union leaders frequently complain that they have second-class status in the party compared with other groups such as environmentalists or suburban voters. During the battle over public employee unions in Wisconsin, most national Democrats were noticeably absent from the debate. Before the Wisconsin gubernatorial election that followed the recall, President Obama was willing to tweet his support for Gov. Scott Walker's opponent, Tom Barrett, but unwilling to actually visit. This fissure has high costs for the Democrats and for liberalism more generally. Organized labor has been integral to the organizational strength of liberalism throughout the 20th century, as the most reliable and powerful force to get out the vote in elections and to help build congressional coalitions behind progressive legislation. The alliance, which formed when the AFL helped President Woodrow Wilson during the early stages of World War I, flourished during the New Deal. Democrats won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working- and middle-class Americans find economic security. The Wagner Act (1935) cemented this marriage as the federal government legitimated the right of workers to organize in unions. Labor leaders like Sidney Hillman from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, who helped found the CIO, established the first political action committee to help FDR win re-election in 1944. During World War II, most of the major unions were a key part of the homeland effort, assisting the administration as it moved to convert factories to wartime production. In 1948, President Harry Truman would not have won re-election had it not been for organized labor, which in the final weeks of the campaign mobilized its troops to defeat New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. ""Labor did it!"" cried Truman, who won the vote of 89% of the automobile workers, recounted historian Nelson Lichtenstein. Although a Republican was in the White House for most of the 1950s, organized labor helped a growing number of liberal Democrats win office in the House and Senate. They promoted proposals for civil rights and health insurance for the elderly that gradually gained support in the House and Senate. In addition to supporting Lyndon's Johnson's election campaign in 1964, the AFL-CIO, which had formed in 1955 when the two major coalitions of unions decided to merge, proved integral to lobbying for Johnson's domestic proposals. George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, and Walter Reuther, the vice president of the AFL-CIO and the head of the United Auto Workers, were regular visitors to the White House, helping Johnson not only with bills directly related to labor but with other parts of his domestic agenda, ranging from the War on Poverty to civil rights. When he feared there were not enough votes among Democrats for the war on poverty, LBJ relied on organized labor to pressure business in Pennsylvania to push liberal Republicans in the state to support the bill. Even Jimmy Carter, who in 1976 ran as an outsider and railed against traditional Democratic interests, depended on unions to bring out the vote and on unionized workers to vote for him in key industrial states for his victory on election day. The relationship between labor and Democrats frayed after the 1970s. One of the reasons was that organized labor simply lost much of its muscle. Membership declined dramatically from the highs of 30% of the work force in the 1950s and the 1960s to a little over 12% today. With fewer members, more Democrats were tempted to look elsewhere to build their electoral muscle. Organized labor also suffered as Democrats reached out more aggressively to different constituencies, middle class suburbanites, consumer activists, young Americans and African-Americans, who didn't have as much connection to unions and often saw them as an ""entrenched interest"" that didn't have the best interest of the party in mind. These tensions started to play out in the 1972 election, when Meany endorsed Richard Nixon rather than Democrat George McGovern. Some working-class Americans proved to be more conservative on cultural issues and often opposed to civil rights policies that Democrats had promoted. And some union leaders felt that Democrats were becoming too dovish on foreign policy. The tensions continued to affect the electorate through the 2008 primary, when Hillary Clinton tried to appeal to working-class Democrats who felt that Obama favored other factions in the party. Finally, the expansion and strengthening of the lobbying world since the 1970s vastly increased the number of interest groups who favored business. These groups provided financial support to members of both parties and often made it difficult for Democrats to take a pro-union stand. But Democrats can't afford to lose the enthusiastic support of organized labor. Of all the groups in the Democratic coalition, labor remains the one with the greatest ground force and organizational strength -- and which represents a constituency rather than a particular issue (like the environment) -- that can help Democrats sustain a broad coalition. During Obama's struggle with Congress over health care, labor was essential in the final days of the congressional vote to convincing unhappy liberals to support a bill even without a public option. In this election, labor will be integral in the handful of swing states that will determine the outcome. With heightened economic inequality and high rates of unemployment, unions have the ability to have even greater resonance with the electorate. Obama and the Democratic Party will suffer unless the party starts to demonstrate that the concerns of working Americans are more than campaign rhetoric but are, in fact, a defining feature of their party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.",5,6.1739685135102516
d7108785d639123ac36d5d801659fa407c22d2d1,CNN,"(CNN) -- A man and a woman have been charged by police in Italy after they were found having sex in a confession box, it was reported Wednesday.

91fd88d74bfb00b91d5866ec10fa73020828257e,CNN,"(CNN) -- It doesn't sound like it should be that hard. The challenge: Design an aircraft that, powered only by a human, can reach 3 meters (9.84 feet) in altitude and hover for at least 60 seconds. And yet that dare, first issued in 1980, stymied the world's best flight engineers. Dozens of teams tried. Only a handful managed to get their ""human helicopter"" off the ground. None won the elusive $250,000 Sikorsky Prize, established by the American Helicopter Society for the first team to accomplish the feat. Until this year. Thirty-three years after the Sikorsky Prize was established, a Canadian team led by Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson claimed it in June with a 64-second flight in an indoor athletic arena outside Toronto. While Robertson tracked their progress from the field below, Reichert powered their delicate aircraft by pedaling a bicycle-like apparatus that twirled four enormous rotors. 11 Kickstarter projects that raised $1M or more . Their achievement was the second flight milestone for Reichert and Robertson, who are becoming pioneers in the small but emerging field of human-powered aviation. Three years ago the pair built perhaps the first flapping-wing aircraft, powered by a human, to sustain flight. All of which raises a logical question: Why do these things? What's the point of designing aircraft that hardly anybody will ever fly? ""There's not ... practicality to a lot of what we do,"" admitted Robertson. ""You won't be flying your human-powered flapping-wing airplane or your human-powered helicopter to work. ""But all of our projects challenge people's conventional way of thinking,"" he told CNN at the recent PopTech conference in Camden, Maine, where he and Reichert were cheered for their innovative approach to problem-solving. ""We really want people to understand that impossible is nothing,"" he added. ""And just because someone says you can't do something, doesn't mean you (can't). With the application of passion and persistence and innovative, creative thinking, you can really take on any challenge."" Photos: The Wright brothers take flight . Modern-day da Vincis . Leonardo da Vinci sketched plans for the first human-powered, flapping-wing aircraft, known as an ornithopter, more than 500 years ago. Since then, of course, a fixed-wing design has become the standard for airplanes. But that hasn't stopped aerospace engineers from trying make a variety of ornithopters fly. Reichert and Robertson, graduates of the University of Toronto, launched their ornithopter project in 2006 and began flight testing their aircraft, the Snowbird, three years later. The plane had a wingspan of 105 feet -- comparable to that of a Boeing 737 -- but weighed only 94 pounds. A car towed the plane into the air to get it started, while Reichert sat in a small cockpit and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system that flapped the wings up and down. With every failed test flight -- which broke more than a few planes -- the two engineers learned a little more. ""Basically, with these aircraft, the mantra is, 'You don't fly any higher than you're willing to fall.' And that tends to keep you fairly safe,"" Reichert said. ""We've had some crashes, but no real injuries."" Unusual energy sources of the future . Finally, in August 2010, in a suburban Toronto field, Snowbird was able to sustain altitude and airspeed for 19.3 seconds while covering a distance of about 475 feet. Reichert, Robertson and their team believe the brief flight set a world record for an aircraft of its kind. Then came the human-powered helicopter. The team built the aircraft, dubbed Atlas, in three months, but it took another nine months of crash-filled flight testing before they hit their target. ""Whenever we had a big crash, it was devastating. It took so much of our time to piece Humpty Dumpty back together again. The whole helicopter is built sort of like a house of cards -- if one thing goes, the entire thing falls apart,"" Robertson said. ""But every time we picked ourselves back up (after a crash), we would know a little bit more than last time."" Innovative shelter pods help the homeless through winter . A land speed record . In 2012, Reichert and Robertson established AeroVelo, a company dedicated to seeking sustainable enginering and design solutions to technological challenges by using human-powered vehicles as a teaching platform. Now the two young engineers have their sights on another big goal: Setting a land speed record for the fastest human-powered bicycle. In September, they went to Battle Mountain, Nevada, for the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge, where teams compete on flat desert roads to race aerodynamic bicycles as fast as cars. Pedaled by Reichert, their entry Bluenose -- a recumbent bike encased in a sleek carbon-fiber shell -- reached speeds of 77 mph on flat ground. ""The fact that a human engine -- about the equivalent power of an electric motor the size of your fist -- can power a bicycle at the same speed as that of a car, which has a hundred times or more the power, is really the innovative and inspiring thing that we think people should understand,"" Robertson said. Malls of the future . Reichert and Robertson plan to return to Battle Mountain next year with a faster bike and take aim at the world speed record of 83.8 mph, set this fall by a Dutch team. Unlike the ornithopter and the helicopter, a human-powered, high-speed bike might actually have a future as a practical mode of personal transportation. But even if it doesn't, Reichert and Robertson will keep pushing against the boundaries of what humans can achieve. The two young Canadians believe their biggest contribution to flight and speed engineering may be to inspire others to tackle what seems insurmountable. ""It's very easy to say something's impossible,"" Reichert said. ""It's much more difficult to change your assumptions, and change your context, to make something possible.""

35ab35085ae8cff91cb2f16459ebd750b48a8f33,CNN,"(CNN) -- Iran unveiled the first long-range military drone manufactured in the country on Sunday, state media reported. The unmanned aerial vehicle is capable of carrying out bombing missions against ground targets and flying long distances at a high speed, Press TV said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended the unveiling of the drone, dubbed the ""Karrar,"" in a ceremony marking Iran's Defense Industry Day. In February, Iran inaugurated the production line for two types of drones with bombing and reconnaissance capabilities, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. Iran has manufactured its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles and fighter planes since 1992, according to Press TV. The country successfully tested a radar-evading drone with bombing capabilities in June 2009, Press TV said. In March 2009, U.S. military officials said U.S. fighter jets in Iraq shot down an unmanned Iranian spy drone aircraft. At the time, most major state-run media outlets in Iran did not carry news of any incident involving an Iranian drone and Iraq's national security adviser declined to comment. Unmanned vehicles have become a staple of modern combat. U.S. military officials have said remotely-controlled drones minimize risk and allow troops to spy on and attack enemy combatants. Ahead of the drone's unveiling, Iran's defense minister said the country's military planned to reveal a project of ""great importance"" on Sunday, according to state-run Press TV. ""Iran's defense capability has reached a point which does not need any aid from other countries,"" Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said, according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency. It is not clear whether the unveiling of the long-range drone was the announcement he was referring to. Vahidi's announcement Saturday came as Iran began fueling its first nuclear energy plant in the southern city of Bushehr, the nation's state media reported. Press TV said the effort will help the country create nuclear-generated electricity. But some Western nations have questioned whether the nuclear fuel will be used solely for electricity, suggesting that Iran would eventually try to enrich uranium on its own, providing material for nuclear weapons. The United States has questioned Iran's motives in continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. ""Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said earlier this month. ""It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program,"" he said. Iran has maintained all along that the site will produce energy, but the United States and some other international observers remain unconvinced. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to Russian reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Wednesday, brushed off Western concerns about the Bushehr facility, calling it ""the most important anchor holding Iran to the nonproliferation regime,"" according to the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti.",2,8.868382361635536
2516833afa50c5eb27449545c65d5fc79a765878,CNN,"New York (CNN) -- He was a cold, calculating, ""morally depraved"" man who spent the last years of his socialite and megaphilanthropist mother's life bilking her fortune to line his pockets. That's one way to see Anthony Marshall -- and it's the only way, according to the prosecutors who secured a conviction against him for grand larceny and scheming to defraud his mother, Brooke Astor. Now as the 85-year-old son prepares to be sentenced Monday for his crimes, another portrait of him has emerged -- thanks to close friends and celebrity acquaintances (including Al Roker and Whoopi Goldberg) who sent letters to the court in hopes of saving him from a lengthy prison sentence. The man prosecutors described during the trial is apparently unrecognizable to many of Marshall's friends and acquaintances. He was a loyal, churchgoing man, a Purple Heart recipient wounded in Iwo Jima during World War II and a son who tried mightily but could never live up to the high ideals of his socialite mother, according to letters friends submitted to the court. And now, they say he is a frail and sickly man who has faced extreme humiliation and would essentially be given a death sentence if a judge hands down the maximum sentence allowed. It will be up to Judge A. Kirke Bartley Jr. to decide how to reconcile the two portraits of Tony Marshall. He faces a minimum one to three years, or as much as eight to 25 years in state prison. The drastically differing views have only further heightened interest in the case, which during the trial stage was a tabloid feeding frenzy, fostering headlines such as ""Bad heir day,"" ""Mrs. Astor's disaster"" and ""DA's kick in the Astor."" The witness list was a virtual ""Who's Who"" of New York's social elite -- including Henry Kissinger, Graydon Carter, Barbara Walters, Vartan Gregorian and Annette de la Renta. During the case, prosecutors and witnesses portrayed Marshall as an only son preying on his physically and mentally ill 101-year-old mother. Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann called the case ""disturbing,"" and said the trial told the story of ""how a son, an only son, would stoop so low to steal from his own mother in the sunset years of her life in order to line his own pockets and the pockets of his wife."" His only goal, they said, was to selfishly tap her fortune -- money that prosecutors said Astor intended to donate to ordinary New Yorkers who needed help after she died. He was convicted of the most serious charges against him -- first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud. One of the most serious convictions involved Marshall giving himself a $1 million-a-year raise for handling his mother's affairs, Seidemann said. During trial testimony, Marshall's lawyers called no character witnesses to come to his defense. So the new letters from friends are the first attempts by those who know him to share what they believe is his true character. Whoopi Goldberg told a judge in her letter that she met Tony Marshall and his wife, Charlene, 10 years ago when Goldberg moved into a building on the Upper East Side with Frank Langella. Unlike other residents who turned their nose up at her, Goldberg said she became quick friends with the Marshalls. Her interactions with Tony, she wrote, gave her an insight into his relationship with his mother, and in turn taught her about how fame can affect family dynamics. ""I also understand what it must be like for my own daughter to be around my fame,"" she wrote. ""I am not comparing myself to Mrs. Astor, but I've seen how you can be dismissed as not being good enough, or hip enough, and seeing it happen to Tony made me make sure that it didn't happen to my own daughter."" The humiliation and ugliness of the trial was punishment enough and a prison sentence would be unjust, friends argued in the letters. Marshall's cardiologist, Kenneth W. Franklin, also wrote to urge the judge to consider his age and health in sentencing. A prison sentence ""will accelerate his deterioration from cardiac and neurologic disease and would result in his premature death due to medical complications,"" he wrote. NBC's ""Today"" show weatherman Al Roker came to Marshall's defense too, having met him at his church 10 years ago. He argued Marshall had suffered enough, paying a price greater than any sentence a judge could hand down -- seeing his son turn on him during the trial and being portrayed in a negative light each day. ""Given his advanced age and deteriorating health, justice may be better served by turning a compassionate eye towards this good son, father and patriot and finding it in your heart not to add 'prisoner' to Anthony Marshall's otherwise unblemished resume,"" Roker wrote in his letter to the court. Goldberg too, believed ""breaking this man"" by putting him in prison, was not the right punishment. ""Please don't put him in jail,"" she writes at the end of her letter. ""It would only amount to an unnecessary cruelty that would serve no real purpose. Hasn't Tony been through enough?"" CNN's Beth Karas and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.",1,8.583140483894478
a425dfa2088a6b15885ea74bc3c9486479430c78,CNN,"Chongqing, China (CNN) -- I glimpse the sprawling hotel from a distance, nestled into the lush hills on the outskirts of Chongqing. The air is fresher here, the temperature several degrees cooler than the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people below. In its heyday this was a high-end resort area but as we drive along the windy road towards it, I can see it is well past its prime. There are rundown buildings, dogs sprawl on the concrete and the smattering of restaurants, massage centers and karaoke bars clearly haven't had a facelift in decades. Last November, Neil Heywood, a British businessman with seemingly rare access to the rich and powerful in China, took this same journey. He would never return. His body was found in the Nanshan Lijing Holiday hotel, now the scene of a murder investigation. China enters internet 'battlefield' over Bo . Heywood is at the center of one of the most extraordinary, mysterious and scandalous stories in recent Chinese history. His death is the vital link in a chain of events that has seen a man once touted as a potential President of China purged from the Communist Party leadership, his wife investigated for murder, and his deputy in custody after he sought asylum at a United States Consulate. And it all started here, in this grimy, dilapidated hotel; a hotel my crew and I have now checked into. Other TV crews have been turned away at the gate, the traditional hand over the camera shot, but we've managed to find rooms. With key in hand I'm walking in the footsteps of Heywood. China promises thorough investigation into Bo scandal . It is a musty hotel corridor. There is a stale smell of damp carpet mixed with years of stale cigarette smoke. It's hardly the type of salubrious establishment befitting Heywood's high flying image. When I open the door -- the lock itself was jammed and took several tries -- the room is hardly an improvement. The furnishings are old and chipped -- a faded, flimsy lounge and a double bed with a garish purple and white vinyl bed head. There is a bug fighting for its life on the floor, skirting boards are busted and power points dislodged from the walls with exposed electrical wires. The air conditioning switch is old and faded yellow. When I switch it on the fan splutters before rattling to life. This is a hotel that has seen better days. The only decorations here are faded plastic flowers, and appropriately for this story, a jigsaw puzzle on the wall. At night mini-skirted call girls can be seen in the corridors furtively knocking on doors. I am reminded over and over again of how this seems such an unlikely setting for a baffling story that has captivated the country and thrown open the secretive doors of the all-powerful party. There are police everywhere. Patrol cars parked in the driveway, plain clothed investigators moving around the grounds. Oh to be a fly on the wall in the hotel staff rooms here, but publicly they will say nothing. Over lunch we tempt waitresses for any morsel of information, but they are well versed in keeping their mouths shut. ""There are lots of police here, what's happening?"" we ask. ""Nothing. They're just having lunch,"" one waitress replies before scurrying off the moment our plates hit the table. Yet behind closed doors this is all anyone is talking about. With each passing day more details are emerging of Heywood's business and personal links to one of China's most powerful families, and how it all allegedly went terribly wrong. Bo Xilai was the Communist Party Chief of Chongqing, a man who ruled this city with an iron fist. He made his name by driving out criminal gangs, sending underground heavies to jail. He presided over strong economic growth and did it all to a soundtrack of communist revolutionary-era songs broadcast on local television. To many locals, especially the poor we have spoken too, he was a hero. One shoe-shine lady told me he made the streets safer and the city greener. But to his critics he was an ambitious authoritarian who used his crime-busting campaign to target enemies and rivals. Now he's in disgrace, stripped of his titles and hidden from view. His former top cop and right-hand man, Wang Lijun, split from Bo and sought refuge in an American Consulate. Sources in the party now claim he'd argued with Bo after raising suspicions the Party boss' wife had a hand in Heywood's death. The investigation has yet to reveal its findings, but multiple diplomatic, business and political sources talk of Heywood's business and personal dealings with the Bo family. All the major players are dead or silenced. Dozens of people connected with the case have been arrested and Gu Kailai, Bo's wife, is under investigation for murder. I finally get one local man to talk. He doesn't condemn Bo. ""He should be remembered for the good things he did,"" he says. But like everyone he is fascinated by the twists and turns of this case. ""Bo Xilai is under investigation in Beijing,"" he says, ""Gu Kailai is his wife, she's involved in the death of that British man Neil Heywood,"" he tells me excitedly. As we walk the grounds of the hotel we get even closer to where it all began. Heywood was staying in what has been described as an upmarket villa in the complex. It has a price tag of $700 a night. If so it is greatly inflated. No one will say which exact villa it was and there is tight security, but we do manage to get inside one of the dozen or so two-story units attached to the hotel. Inside it is as tired and dated as the standard rooms -- the same faded furniture and stains on the walls. Yet the very state of this hotel, the sleaziness if you like, only lends to the fascination. What happened on the night Heywood died? What will this mean for Bo and his family? Right now the answers to these questions are locked behind these walls and we can only peer through the windows.",7,7.847149065446597
98042c8dbeece420c8a35dde12d408dfc601d07f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Should young children be able to use Facebook? And if so, under what conditions? Those are the questions bloggers and Twitter users are batting around the Internet on Monday following a news report saying Facebook is looking into ways it could let kids under the age of 13 use the site with parental consent. Currently, Facebook bans children younger than 13. Data from Microsoft Research and Consumer Reports, however, show that many kids use the site anyway, often with their parents' knowledge. A 2011 Consumer Reports survey found 7.5 million people younger than 13 use the site; nearly a third of 11-year-olds and more than half of 12-year-olds use Facebook with their parents' knowledge, according to a 1,007-person survey supported by Microsoft Research. Proponents of lifting Facebook's under-13 ban say letting young kids on Facebook with the help of adults would allow them to use the social network more safely. ""Whether we like it or not, millions of children are using Facebook, and since there doesn't seem to be a universally effective way to get them off the service, the best and safest strategy would be to provide younger children with a safe, secure and private experience that allows them to interact with verified friends and family members without having to lie about their age,"" Larry Magid writes at Forbes.com. Magid says Facebook for kids should not have ads and there need to be ""extra privacy protections"" that would involve parents helping their kids to use the social network safely. Others say Facebook is trying to profit from the under-13 crowd. Common Sense Media, an advocacy group, compared Facebook to ""Big Tobacco."" Poll: Should kids younger than 13 be allowed to use Facebook? ""With the growing concerns and pressure around Facebook's business model, the company appears to be doing whatever it takes to identify new revenue streams and short-term corporate profits to impress spooked shareholders,"" the group's CEO, James Steyer, said in a statement. ""But here's the most important issue: There is absolutely no proof of any meaningful social or educational value of Facebook for children under 13. Indeed, there are very legitimate concerns about privacy as well as the impact on the social, emotional and cognitive development of children. What Facebook is proposing is similar to the strategies used by Big Tobacco in appealing to young people -- try to hook kids early, build your brand, and you have a customer for life. ""What's next? Facebook for toddlers?"" The Wall Street Journal on Monday published a front-page report saying Facebook is looking into ways to give younger children access to the social-networking site, which has more than 900 million users around the world and which made its lackluster stock market debut last month. ""Mechanisms being tested include connecting children's accounts to their parents' and controls that would allow parents to decide whom their kids can 'friend' and what applications they can use,"" the newspaper said, citing anonymous sources who are familiar with the dealings. ""The under-13 features could enable Facebook and its partners to charge parents for games and other entertainment accessed by their children, the people said."" In a statement issued to CNN and other news outlets, Facebook did not deny looking into the issue but said it does not have anything formal to announce: . ""Many recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to enforce age restrictions on the Internet, especially when parents want their children to access online content and services. We are in continuous dialogue with stakeholders, regulators and other policymakers about how best to help parents keep their kids safe in an evolving online environment."" What do you think?

7843bfafeecc2a9682a7c193ab33436a890fbd20,CNN,"(CNN) -- Real Madrid, the kings of Europe, will take on a team living one of the greatest fairytale stories in Bulgarian football history. Ludogorets Razgrad, which clinched its place in the group stage of the Champions League for the first time following a dramatic penalty shootout playoff victory, will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to face the defending champion. Real, which defeated city rival Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon last year to win ""La Decima"" -- it's 10th title -- is attempting to become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League. Ludogorets will also face five-time champion Liverpool -- back in the Champions League after a five-year absence -- as well as Swiss side FC Basel in Group A. Ludogorets defeated Romanian side Steaua Bucharest thanks to two penalty saves from stand-in goalkeeper Cosmin MoÅ£i. MoÅ£i , a defender, went in goal for the shootout after goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off with one minute of extra time remaining and made himself a hero. Surprisingly Liverpool have won all three of their European Cup matches against 10-time champion Real and have never even conceded a goal against them. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich will face Manchester City in a repeat of last season's group stage contests. Munich produced a fine performance to win 3-1 in Manchester but was stunned by the English club at the Allianz Arena, losing 3-2 in the return fixture. ""We're coming up against familiar teams here,"" Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer told his club's website. ""They're not easy opponents by any means, but we know from last year where we stand and can use that going in."" Bayern and City will also have to negotiate tricky ties against Roma and CSKA Moscow if they are to progress. In Group F, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face two of his former clubs after Paris Saint-Germain was drawn alongside Barcelona and Ajax. PSG, beaten in the round of 16 by Chelsea last season, will also have to take on Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia. ""These are games where every team has the right to dream,"" Barcelona's director of sport, former Spanish international keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, told the club website. ""We have our dreams, and they all have their own."" It's a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu for Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund after the two teams were drawn together for a third consecutive season. Dortmund, which was narrowly beaten by Real Madrid in last year's quarterfinal, triumphed against Arsene Wenger's side in London but was topped at home by ""the Gunners."" Turkish side Galatasaray, which reached the second round last time around, will also provide a stern test, with Belgian club Anderlecht completing the line-up. Atletico Madrid, which lost last year's final in extra time, will face Italian champion Juventus, Olympiacos and Swedish side Malmo in Group A. Juventus crashed out in the group stage last season. Olympiacos was beaten by Manchester United in the last-16 during the previous edition while Malmo is making its first appearance in the group stage. In Group C, Benfica, which has not won the competition since 1962, takes on Zenit Saint Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Radamel Falcao's Monaco. Chelsea, the 2012 champion, will be confident of making it through Group G after being drawn against Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Slovenian champion Maribor. Athletic Bilbao's reward for defeating Napoli in the playoff are games against Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and BATE Borisov. Champions League draw: .

7370c7111bc14b692e452940cb4eb427a5c7a8a6,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Philippine military said it killed a man who is on the FBI most-wanted terror list and two other senior militants Thursday in a predawn airstrike on a remote southern island. About 15 militants died in the early morning airstrike on the island province of Sulu, part of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao, according to a spokesman for the Philippines armed forces. The dead included two senior figures in Jemaah Islamiyah and members of the militant group Abu Sayyaf, said Col. Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos, the spokesman. U.S. officials had a $5 million reward for the capture of Jemaah Islamiyah leader Zulkifli bin Abdul Hir, according to the FBI website. The Malaysian, also known as Marwan, was on the FBI most-wanted list for ""providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists"" and contributing ""goods and services"" to a global terror network. Another Jemaah Islamiyah member Mohammad Ali, also known as Muawiyah, and Abu Sayyaf leader Gumbahali Jumdail were also among those killed, according to the spokesman. The airstrike was a joint effort between the army, air force, the navy and the police, and was ""very brief but precise,"" Burgos said. The Philippine police are at the scene helping identify the bodies, Burgos said, but added that DNA tests had been conducted. In the past, Philippine officials made premature announcements about the capture and deaths of Indonesian fugitives Dulmatin, who turned up in Indonesia in 2010, and Umar Patek, who was captured in Pakistan last year. Both had fled to the southern Philippines and were reported captured or killed in Mindanao. The Mindanao group of islands includes a Muslim autonomous region set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. The Jemaah Islamiyah terror group first came to international attention when the Bali bombings of October 2002 provided a stark warning of the group's abilities and its deadly ambitions. Active across much of Southeast Asia, it has close ties with Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network.",1,8.773931406877681
f7453992378bac1df8d7b84436f32fecc3d67acd,CNN,"(CNN) -- For years as he chased his dream, shooting hoops and racing up and down the court, professional basketball player Jason Collins wore the No. 98 jersey. It was a personal gesture, a way of remembering Matthew Shepard, a gay college student whose own dreams were ended in 1998, when he died after being tied to a fence post, beaten and tortured. But when Collins came out as the first openly gay NBA player in history, that number suddenly took on a broader significance. ""I've grown so much as an individual, I've come across so many great people, great organizations, heard so many great stories, inspiring stories,"" Collins said, adding ""... it's nice to have a positive impact on someone's else's life, and I feel like with my actions that I've had a positive impact on someone's else's life."" This week, that jersey became the top-selling one in the NBA. The NBA announced Friday that it will donate all proceeds from the sale of Collins jerseys to the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and the Matthew Shepard Foundation. In addition, the league will auction off Collins' autographed, game-worn jerseys to benefit the same organizations. ""It's really cool to see the support that's out there,"" Collins told CNN's Rachel Nichols in an interview set to air Friday evening. ""And yeah, it's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and, you know, wearing it with pride. So I hope that continues, and you know I'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to, you know, do my job."" Collins became a symbol for the gay rights movement after disclosing that he is gay in an April Sports Illustrated magazine column. Since then, he's received a warm outpouring of support from basketball colleagues, league officials and fans. ""I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said after Collins' signing last Sunday. Collins' path from a little-known, aging NBA center to gay rights icon who was invited by first lady Michelle Obama to the State of the Union is one that speaks to the nation's changing attitudes about homosexuality. Last week, he signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll conducted in September, 56% of the nation supports marriage for same-sex couples, compared with only 25% who supported it in 1996. A CNN poll in 2010 was the first time a poll found that a majority of respondents backed it. We are becoming a very different nation from the one in which Shepard's murder became a watershed moment and rallying cry for the gay community. Becoming, but not quite there yet. ""I've met some other athletes who sort of are in the same position as I am, and we're sort of like a fraternity just trying to help each other, just trying to, uh, keep inspiring each other, whether it be Robbie Rogers or Michael Sam, the list goes on and on,"" Collins told Nichols of Rogers, an openly gay soccer player, and Sam, an openly gay NFL prospect. ""So many great athletes I've met along my journey. And it's really great to, you know, hear each other's stories and keep, you know, inspiring each other (out here)."" When she visited Collins in Denver, Shepard's mother, Judy, gave the basketball player some words of encouragement. ""... Her message was like, 'let the haters hate.' Just keep ... living your life and keep going out there and being yourself,"" Collins said.",1,11.420018908104694

A photograph showing Moroccan-born suspect Said Rehou. The suspect, Said Rehou, 27, born in Casablanca, Morocco, allegedly held indoctrination sessions for Islamic militants at his former Madrid home, the statement said. ""Various individuals who participated in those meetings later were implicated directly or indirectly in the Casablanca attacks of 2003 and the March 11, 2004, attacks in Madrid,"" the statement said. The Madrid train bombings -- coordinated attacks on four morning-rush commuter trains -- killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. Spanish courts have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the Madrid bombings, along with four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Seven other prime Islamic suspects killed themselves in an explosion as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb three weeks after the bombings. The Casablanca bombings in May 2003 killed 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers. Rehou is wanted in Spain for belonging to a terrorist group, and is thought to have formed part of a cell created in Spain in 2002, with the aim of recruiting fighters to carry out attacks in Morocco, Spain and other countries, the police statement said.

cba4d0faa09be4d161e783dd3993394f879c17df,CNN,"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson held his nerve to secure a third win on the PGA Tour Sunday after the 32-year-old beat Webb Simpson in a playoff to clinch the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. The left-hander and fellow American Simpson both finished on 15-under par after final rounds of 69 and a second additional hole was needed to separate the pair. A fine approach shot out of a fairway bunker enabled Watson, who turned professional in 2003, to find the cup with two putts and claim victory. The U.S. duo finished two shots clear of compatriots Jason Dufner and Tommy Gainey and South Korea's K.J. Choi, who all ended the tournament on 13-under. Watson, who had won earlier this year at the Farmers Insurance tournament at Torrey Pines, slipped three-strokes behind Simpson, 25, with only eight holes remaining of regulation play. ""This week, I won [by] not getting down on bad shots, just staying focused on what I'm supposed to be doing,"" Watson told the PGA Tour's official web site. Simpson was hit with a crucial one-stroke penalty on the 15th hole when he was penalized after his ball moved on the green while he was contemplating his next shot. ""I better limit my comments on that rule, because I think it's such a bad rule,"" said Simpson. ""When the wind or other natural things affect the golf ball, the player shouldn't be penalized. ... It was just unfortunate, but Bubba deserves a win, and I'm pretty happy for him."" Watson sympathized with his opponent and acknowledged the punishment handed out to Simpson played a part in his victory. ""If I didn't win, he would have been a nice guy to have win. We went to a playoff, so obviously one shot is the difference. ... It's a sad way to win, but I won.""

63a4a8b21f0095e9f0350043d52b1e882c0431d8,CNN,"San Francisco (CNN) -- On first glance, the new, never-to-be-actually-named iPad is exactly the same as its predecessor: Same size, same price, same colors. But guts count for something. And the guts of the new iPad -- don't you dare call it iPad 3 -- are what make this tablet computer a step forward from the iPad 2. They're also what give Apple execs some room to claim this device as ""amazing"" and ""revolutionary,"" rather than run-of-the-mill and incremental. The truth is that the new Apple iPad probably falls somewhere in the middle. It's neither dud nor game-changer. I got to handle the new tablet for a few minutes after Apple's launch event Wednesday. My first impressions: . The screen . The main upgrade is the screen, which is markedly crisper. Apple says it quadrupled the number of pixels on the iPad's 9.7-inch display to the point that there are now 3.1 million pixels on the screen, with a total resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels. Color saturation on the device was increased 44% relative to the iPad 2, the company says. ""Your retina in your eye cannot discern those individual pixels,"" Apple's Phil Schiller said at the news conference. ""The images on it look stunning."" CNNMoney: New iPad up close . That's not overstatement. Images do seem to have jumped out of the real world. That's good for people who want to watch movies, look at photos and play games on the new iPad. It also could be a big step forward for people who want to read digital books on the device. Enlarge the text on the latest-gen iPad, and the letters maintain their quality. The edges of the fonts are perfectly smooth, as if they're molded from plastic. ""One of the iPad's biggest competitors has been paper,"" said Nick Bilton, a tech columnist at The New York Times, ""and now this is better than paper."" Gaming . Another new feature of the guts: The A5X ""quad-core"" chip, which is supposed to help render graphics much more quickly. This could be a boon for gamers, who likely will see high-resolution and more graphics-intensive games coming out for the tablet. In a short demo on Wednesday, a flying game called ""Sky Gamblers"" looked like nothing you would expect to see on a mobile device. Mountains and valleys appear photo-realistic, and the steam coming out of the back of the plane warps the sky around it. During its presentation, Apple highlighted gaming as a big advantage of the latest iPad. ""This new device has more memory and higher screen resolution than an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3,"" said Mike Capps, president of Epic Games. Apps . Apple announced several new ones, and while these should work on older versions of the iPad, they're designed to take advantage of the new tablet's better screen. iPhoto is among the standouts. Apple's photo-organization software really comes to life on the high-def iPad, where users will be able to sharpen their photos with new features. One detects the horizon in a landscape photo and, with the tap of a finger, will make it perfectly level. Another lets users rub a finger over a section of a photograph to lighten, darken or soften it. It makes photo editing more hands-on and intuitive than before. Connectivity . While it's far from clear that tablet owners really want to connect to the Internet over cellular data networks (rather than Wi-Fi, which is often free but, of course, isn't available everywhere), the new iPad has 4G capabilities for those who do. In a demo, Apple reps showed videos loading considerably faster on the new iPad than on the iPad 2. Again, this plays into Apple's hope that this will be an even-better device for viewing media. ""This new iPad has the most wireless bands of any device that has ever shipped, and it is truly revolutionary,"" Apple's Phil Schiller said during a news conference. Who's to say whether these updates will lead people to want to purchase the new iPad, or to upgrade from a previous version. Nothing about the iPad was completely overhauled, but the overall user experience is crisper and speedier than before. We'll leave you to be the judge. Let us know what you think of these updates in the comments section. Does this new iPad sound like it's worth the cash?",6,9.075647661332237

The early reviews of the show at London's Meltdown Festival (curated this year by Yoko Ono) speak of his boundless, youthful energy as he bounds on to the stage like a jack-in-the box who's just escaped the confines of the toy cupboard, cajoling, teasing and captivating his audience with the skills of the consummate showman. ""There's a lot of craft,"" he says. ""Everything from learning the different parts of the room to reading the reactions to ultimately. You're like a funnel or a vacuum cleaner. You're a transformer between all the energy of the group and its music and the different energies of all the people in the different parts of the room. What's really happening when it's good is that everybody's flowing into each other's presence, maybe through the medium of a particular riff or a particular chorus but also a monkey -- a well-rehearsed monkey,"" he laughs. Read more: Foo Fighters drummer will play Iggy Pop . Pop's monkey business has revealed itself in various forms of bad behavior on stage over the years. Among the less notorious antics, are his trademark topless performance and an affinity to stage-dive into his audience. ""The first time I did it I was 21 years-old and I was opening for Frank Zappa who was great and we were just a local band in a psychedelic bar room,"" he recalls. In those days, he tells me, they would be lucky to get a sympathy fee of $50. ""But we were cute kids and we got to play with everybody and I thought it was my job to make sure that when we played no-one forgot about us. I did that thing that little kids do when they're not getting enough attention from their parents, they just fall forward and wait for maybe somebody to catch 'em. And I would just step off the stage and inspect the audience."" Forty-five years later and he's still at it. ""Last year I did a couple of big dives and I got a couple of stitches because I always overdo it. And at this stage I just fall in once in a while and say ""Hi"" and it's fine -- just a gentle collapse is okay!"" But some things have changed since those early days: the after-show party today is an altogether calmer affair, in the company of his third wife Nina Alu, a nice bottle of Bordeaux and ""lots of desserts."" ""And someone will draw my bath and sleep will come hard. There's some element I do with The Stooges... the hardcore stuff. It's a bit like being a prize fighter, there's a lot of nervous energy and you wake up sore."" Pop is currently touring Europe with The Stooges, having recorded ""Ready to Die"" -- only their fifth album in 45 years. His parents named him James Osterberg Junior but playing in a band called The Iguanas led to the nickname ""Iggy"" and an apparent similarity to a local character named ""Pop"" provided the rest. In the early days, he says, he became known as ""The Man You Love To Hate"" and today he's most commonly billed as the ""Godfather of Punk"" -- a term with which he's uncomfortable. ""At first it was just a really embarrassing tag and then it got to be funny and then I just gave up. I've been called lots of things and it's nice to have lots of titles. I'm waiting for Nobel laureate -- no-one's nominating me so I'm putting it out there."" Pop's musical career has been supplemented by a long association with movies both as an actor and musician. Tracks such as ""The Passenger,"" ""Lust for Life,"" ""Search and Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" have appeared on the soundtracks to almost 150 movies and TV series. This summer he'll be played by Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins in the film ""CBGB,"" about the legendary New York music club frequented by the likes of The Ramones, Blondie and Patti Smith. But an unexpected acting connection revealed itself during Pop's visit to London. ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe has confessed to being a huge fan of Iggy and was reported as saying that playing his idol on screen was his ultimate dream. Pop tells me Radcliffe attended last night's gig and the singer seems delighted to be reaching a new generations of fans. ""I think it would be great if everybody played me,"" he says. ""Yeah, come on kid play me! I think it's wonderful it's a gift that anyone would think of me."" However there's one actor in particular with whom Iggy Pop has developed a strong musical bond and friendship -- although it didn't start out that way. ""Johnny Depp was in a couple of bands in the Florida area -- I think Rocky City Angels and The Kids -- and apparently once when I was in my wildest phase I played in Gainesville. He came to the club, he tells me he tried to meet me and tell me about his band and I said: 'Shut up you little turd'."" Happily, the relationship survived this first awkward encounter. ""Since then we've played and we've jammed on and off. He's a very sensitive guitarist, he has a really nice intonation, attack and a really nice sense of music. And we recorded one thing together years ago called 'Hollywood Affair' and we played once on French telly."" Fans of both Depp and Pop have a chance to hear their latest collaboration on the soundtrack of Depp's new film ""The Lone Ranger"" (Depp plays the masked lawman's native American character Tonto) with a rendition of the traditional Gold Rush-era song ""Sweet Betsy from Pike."" ""He called up about this and I think it was late in the game and he didn't have a great cut and with about two weeks to go he said: 'Come on, we gotta get this together so choose a song.' So I tried writing something but it's not my style and 'Sweet Betsy' is just a great great great song and he plays beautifully on it. I just had a great time doing that."" With close friends David Bowie and Lou Reed continuing to stir up the music business and contemporaries The Rolling Stones reaching new musical milestones, Pop remains one of rock's great survivors. ""What's interesting is that for people of our generation that matured in the 1960s, people still seem to be interested. I got to think there was some sorta bump in the quality in that period '65 -- '75. It's pretty much a given that a decent, or better than decent, musician or songwriter is gonna keep doing it in some way throughout their life.""",7,8.354401452817735
6d996d510adce8acd06075bd270fe4010bf9369f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Barcelona ripped apart Spanish title rivals Real Madrid to take top spot in La Liga with an emphatic 5-0 home victory in the first ""Clasico"" of the season on Monday night. Real coach Jose Mourinho suffered an embarrassing first defeat since taking over in May as defending champions Barca moved two points clear after 13 games following the Catalan side's fifth successive win over the capital outfit. The visitors were rocked from the outset as Xavi and Pedro put Pep Guardiola's team 2-0 up inside 20 minutes, then David Villa scored twice in four second-half minutes to effectively end the game before Jeffren's late goal just rubbed salt in Real's wounds. That led to Madrid defender Sergio Ramos being sent off after clattering into Lionel Messi and then shoving Barca captain Carles Puyol to the floor as passions boiled despite the cold, pouring rain. Was this the greatest Clasico of all time? ""One team played to their potential and one didn't,"" Mourinho told AFP after a miserable return to one of his former clubs. ""It was a defeat that we fully deserved but I don't think you can say it reflected the difference between the two sides. ""The championship isn't over today. We are two points behind the leaders but there are lots of games left to play. We have to show character, train hard and get back to winning. I wish we were playing tomorrow."" The most highly-anticipated match of the European season, it was a tempestuous affair that saw nine players booked before then, while Cristiano Ronaldo pushed Guardiola away on the touchline and Ricardo Carvalho escaped an apparent elbow in the face of Messi. Messi could not add to his hat-trick in the 8-0 thrashing of Almeria two weekends ago, but was a constant threat to a flimsy Real defense and he set up both of Villa's goals. Ronaldo is La Liga's top scorer with 15 after a treble last time out, but he was totally overshadowed by FIFA's world player of the year and was reduced to speculative long-range free-kick attempts. Barcelona's key midfielders Xavi and Andre Iniesta dominated possession, forcing Mourinho to take off one of his star signings, Germany's World Cup playmaker Mesut Ozil, at the halftime break. Can La Liga steal Premier League's Asian thunder? Messi hit the post as early as the sixth minute with a delightful flick, and Xavi opened the scoring four minutes later as he cleverly controlled a slide pass from Iniesta with his heel and guided a volley over goalkeeper Iker Casillas. The Real captain was caught out in the 18th minute as he let Villa's low cross slip through his hands to give Pedro an easy chance to make it 2-0 from close range. The match threatened to boil over after half an hour when Ronaldo pushed Guardiola when the coach refused to give him the ball when it went out, resulting in Barca keeper Victor Valdes charging out of his area as players from both teams clashed. Ronaldo and Valdes were both yellow-carded for their part in the melee, then Villa and Real defender Pepe followed them into the referee's book by the 36th minute. El Clasico the key to the title says Ronaldo . Messi was also cautioned just before halftime after he went to ground following an incident with Carvalho -- television replays showed that the Portugal defender was lucky not to be sent off after raising his arm into the Argentine's face. Mourinho brought defensive midfielder Lassan Diarra on at halftime, but just 10 minutes later Villa made it 3-0 as he beat the offside trap to collect Messi's clever throughball. The Spain striker doubled his tally in the 58th minute with a calm finish with the outside of his right foot after a superb diagonal pass from Messi left the Real defense in tatters. Mourinho responded by replacing leftback Marcelo with fellow defender Alvaro Arbeloa, before Carvalho was booked for handling when Pedro seemed set to run free on Casillas' goal. Ramos was yellow-carded in the 73rd minute, and received his marching orders soon after Jeffren beat him to a teasing low cross by fellow replacement Bojan Krkic to make it 5-0 in time added on.",7,7.968379093355953
39fc62c4ff9a6cc4de5986519cbb1a1e402bccfa,CNN,"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy caused $29.4 billion in damages in New Jersey, one of the hardest hit states, said Gov. Chris Christie. The preliminary estimate, which is subject to change, includes damage to personal property, businesses, infrastructure and to the state's tourism industry. The figure also includes aid from federal sources like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration. ""This preliminary number is based on the best available data, field observations and geographical mapping, and supported by expert advice from my Cabinet commissioners and an outside consulting company,"" Christie said in a statement Friday. ""In a short period of time, we put together a comprehensive and responsible estimate, which may increase in the weeks ahead, and I stand ready to work with our Congressional delegation and the Obama Administration to get the funding support New Jersey expects and deserves in the aftermath of this catastrophe,"" he added. Meanwhile, odd-even gas rationing ended early Saturday in New York City, a milestone as the city continues to recover from Sandy, which hit more than three weeks ago. Rationing began on November 9 to keep escalating lines and chaos at the gas stations manageable after the storm left many stations closed just as people without power needed fuel for generators. The city extended the rationing system through Thanksgiving so the lines would remain manageable during the heaviest travel days of the year. Volunteers help Sandy victims start over . ""With more than 85% of gas stations now operating -- a substantial increase from just 25% two weeks ago -- and Thanksgiving and Black Friday behind us, the odd-even license plate system will be rescinded starting tomorrow morning,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on Friday. Over Thanksgiving, the mayor's office distributed thousands of Thanksgiving meals at 30 sites in the areas affected by Sandy. Since the storm recovery began, the city and FEMA have distributed more than 2.7 million meals, 704,260 bottles of water and 170,856 blankets, along with thousands of other supplies that are helping people survive after their belongings were washed away and destroyed in the storm, according to the mayor's office. Despite the progress, the recovery is far from complete. More than 30,000 people remain without power in New York and New Jersey. Many of those people are also without heat. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy . The NYC Health Department said Friday that it will start distributing electric blankets to people who were affected by Sandy, but also urged those people to try to find a warm place with friends or relatives. ""The weather is getting colder and winter is not far off,"" said Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley. ""Living in cold buildings is not good for your health. If your building heat is not going to be restored very soon, look for another warm place to live until it is,"" he said. The traffic pattern in and out of the city is almost restored. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that signal problems that prevented some of the traffic lanes to be open at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel are fixed in time for the post-holiday rush hour commute on Monday morning. The tunnel connects the island of Manhattan to Long Island and Queens. So far, sanitation crews have collected more than 280,000 tons of trash and debris from the storm, officials said. Bloomberg has authorized $1.2 billion for cleanup and damage repairs to homes, public schools, public hospitals and city property. Bloomberg's office also said that donors from around the country have contributed nearly $41 million toward Hurricane Sandy relief.

80754c02b5580c40b8aaa1671f97b13e39e2cf43,CNN,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called Wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs, a Spanish news agency said. People march in support of legalized marijuana in late January in Belem, northern Brazil. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, the EFE news agency said. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. The 17-member panel worked on the report for a year and will forward it to all Latin American governments as well as the United States and the European Union, EFE said. Gaviria said the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Barack Obama in the United States. ""In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,"" EFE quotes Gaviria as saying. Decriminalization should be accompanied by treatment for addicts and public service campaigns on abuse prevention, the commission said. ""If you don't help those who are dependent, you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug,"" Gaviria said. Cardoso said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because ""you have to start somewhere"" and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs, EFE said. Marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is ""less harmful."" The decades-old criminalization of personal consumption has failed to stop the plant's cultivation and distribution, the group said. The commission urged that all current criminal prosecution be aimed at drug cartels and organized crime and not marijuana smokers, EFE said. Zedillo did not attend the news conference but worked on the report, Cardoso said. Wednesday's recommendation was the second time in less than a week that a Latin American government official called for decriminalization. A mayor in Peru suggested Friday that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry. Gusto Sierra, the mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima, said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but doesn't say where to acquire them, the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front-page story headlined ""Say yes to drugs?"" Sierra said he will take the matter up with the nation's executive branch. Zedillo served as president of Mexico from 1994-2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990-94. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995-2002.",1,8.953169030557435
53dafcc9c4641bd9bbd69723c95f3696cac57595,CNN,"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old boy has been detained by Bahraini authorities for nearly a month for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" and for burning tires, an arrest that human rights groups say comes amid the country's continued crackdown on anti-government protesters. Rights groups on Saturday demanded the release of the boy, Ali Hasan, following news that Bahrain's Juvenile Court ordered the youth moved from a jail to a juvenile detention facility. Hasan was arrested on May 14 by Bahraini authorities for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" with about a dozen others, according to the Bahrain International Affairs Authority, the kingdom's information office. Specifically, the boy was involved with burning tires at a roadblock, the office said. ""The juvenile is receiving social care and tutoring at the center. He completed his last exam of the sixth grade level on Thursday,"" the information office said in a statement, which identified the boy as being 12 years old. But an attorney for Hasan's family disputes the government account, saying the boy was playing with two other children in the street when he was stopped by police. The attorney, Shahzalan Khamees, said that police stopped Hasan and two other boys, who managed to run away. Khamees said Hasan claims the police threatened to shoot him with a pellet gun if he ran. The boy, according to Khamees, was then detained for questioning. A second defense attorney, Mohsin Al-Alawi, said he recently visited Hasan and that the boy told him that he didn't take part in an ""illegal gathering."" The boy sobbed, said he is tired and wants to go home, Al-Alawi said. The Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization, an Ireland-based rights group, demanded Hasan's immediate release. There are a ""growing number of children detained for investigation in security cases,"" the group said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights expressed concern about the government's targeting of children under the age of 15 in its crackdown. The rights group said Hasan, who they claim is 11, was the youngest detainee in Bahrain's prison system. The government did not immediately respond to the allegation. Bahrain has been heavily criticized by rights groups for its crackdown on anti-government protests that began February 14, 2011, in the country -- spurred by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the protests failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings following a crackdown in February and then again in mid-March by Bahraini authorities -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash, with the opposition accusing the government of being heavy handed in its crackdown on protests. In November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report highly critical of the crackdown. The commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture during last year's crackdown on protests. The report recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.",1,4.641107397884339
9db28560149f57cf0e53adc8c10b9b04b076cbfe,CNN,"Tyenna Valley, Tasmania (CNN) -- Like many I have been anxiously waiting the outcome of the Tasmanian ""forest peace talks."" But unlike most, I have done so 200 feet (60 meters) above the ground, perched at the top of an old growth tree whose fate depends upon them. A tree I climbed 10 months ago and vowed not to leave until the forests were protected. And then on Saturday the news hit -- the talks had collapsed. The two years of talks between environment groups, unions and industry representatives failed to find the resolution to bring the industry out of crisis and protect Tasmania's high conservation value forests. No deal means clear-felling of old growth forests is set to continue. The tree that has been my home since December 14 last year is a part of 572,000 hectares at the center of the debate. Verified by scientific experts to be of world heritage value, it should have have been on its way to formal protection. And I should have been on my way out of this tree and into a long hot bath! Unfortunately the forestry industry had other ideas, digging in its heels when it came to final crunch. Neither the science nor the economics seem to have won out. The Tasmanian forestry industry is in crisis and being propped up by tax payer funds. There are some who may want to put their heads in the sand, but we cannot go on ignoring today's market realities of a worldwide trend towards environmentally friendly products. From my tree top platform, I have Skyped my way around the globe, speaking to thousands of people. And the message is clear, people don't want to buy furniture and flooring made from the destruction of endangered species habitat, community water catchments or globally significant carbon sinks. The failure of the talks has created uncertainty for the future of the forests here. And with it, uncertainty for me. With no end in sight, who knows how long it will be before I set foot on the ground again? I have already become the Australian record holder for the longest time spent in a tree, after I reached 209 days back in July this year. I hope, for the sake of the forests, that I will not need to break the world record held by Julia Butterfly Hill, who sat for two years in a Californian Redwood. 'Himalayan Viagra' takes its toll on Nepal's environment . In the upper branches of this 400-year-old tree I have endured high wind, snow, hail and extreme conditions. It's been a tough winter, that's for sure. And the weather isn't the only challenge. Living on a three meter platform suspended in the tree tops adds difficulty to every daily task that I once took for granted. No turning on the tap for hot water or going to the shops if you run out of milk! I have to bathe in a small bucket. And I haul up everything I need on a long rope, relying on support from the community for donations of food and supplies. Luckily support has flooded in, from all walks of life, locally and internationally. The many people who visit the base of the tree to say thank you have been overwhelmingly inspirational. And it has helped me get through what is the hardest part of this experience -- the loneliness of being separated from my loved ones. Yet, no matter how challenging, there are constantly moments when I am awe-struck by the beauty of this forest. The coating of snow across the forest in winter, the star speckled skies of summer nights or watching endangered wedge-tailed eagles soar in the skies above. I have watched the seasons come and go. And with it, new life in the forest. Conservationists placed hidden cameras in the forest below, capturing footage of a mother Tasmanian Devil, the day before logging began. This iconic Australian species is listed as endangered in both federal and state legislation. Luckily, the media spotlight from my action had the loggers packing up and leaving after a week, giving these young devils a chance of survival. In February 2012, to our delight, footage was taken of the juvenile devils exploring the world. Sadly, with the collapse of the talks, logging of their habitat could begin again any day now. Autumn color around the world . Many people ask my why I am willing to sacrifice everything in my life, give up my chance to spend time with family and friends, and put my career as a high school teacher on hold, in order to sit in a tree. But when I look around me at this unique and irreplaceable ecosystem the answer is simple: I sit in this tree because from here I believe it is possible to save this forest once and for all. Of course, it takes more than one woman perched 60 meters above the ground; it takes an international community. And I have been able to share my story with the world, powered by solar panels and blogging about my tree top life. I hope my action will be a catalyst, inspiring others to say no to wood products that come from unsustainable forestry practices. And say yes to the protection of the world's globally significant forests. Despite the cloud of uncertainty that now looms over the future of these forests, I am one hundred percent committed to staying in this tree for as long as it takes to see this forest receive the protection it deserves.

0bcfda6623c7cbc7d7ccb30ab7f6d39006bffbc4,CNN,"(CNN) -- Jebb Graff isn't turned off -- yet -- by Carnival Cruise Lines' recent troubles. Graff took a seven-day cruise last fall on the Carnival Fantasy to Grand Turk, Half Moon Cay and Nassau, Bahamas and had a wonderful time. ""It was a fantastic trip,"" wrote Graff, a photographer in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, in an email. ""A few veteran cruisers grumbled about the age of the ship, and the decor being dated, but the service and experience was really great,"" he said. Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise. But he has some conditions. ""There's no question that Carnival should be seriously looking into their maintenance policies and double-checking their work to make sure their customers and crews are having the safest voyages possible,"" wrote Graff. ""If these issues continue to go on unchecked, then I'll change my answer."" Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters . Carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble, according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by CNN.com. But the company has to prove it is tackling the recent spate of mechanical issues faced by four Carnival ships, the most serious of which left more than 4,000 people stranded for days aboard the Carnival Triumph last month. 'A grace period' to fix things . Carnival has a grace period of a couple months to get its act together, according to travel agent Ricci Zukerman. Her mostly high-end clients occasionally book a more budget-oriented Carnival cruise for a family reunion or when they're bringing teenagers along because ""they're the fun ships,"" she said. ""Carnival has been in business for many years, and for a long time there's never been a hitch,"" said Zukerman, president of Worldview Travel. But they need to attend to their maintenance issues. ""If it happens again, I think people will start worrying. There are other ships in the ocean,"" although none quite so affordable, she said. Carnival Cruise Lines announced a ""comprehensive review"" this week of all its ships, prompted by the engine fire that led to the Triumph's stranding in the Gulf of Mexico in February. As the biggest cruise company in the world, parent company Carnival Corp. has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel. In addition to Carnival Cruise Lines, the corporation's portfolio includes brands such as Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa Cruises. The Costa Concordia had a deadly accident off the coast of Italy last year. Five things we've learned about cruising . Overall advance bookings are down . Total advance bookings across all of Carnival Corp.'s brands for 2013 are behind 2012 levels, Carnival said in a news release Friday announcing first quarter financial results. But despite the overall lag, booking volume since January for the rest of the year has been ""running significantly higher than last year at slightly higher prices,"" the company said. ""Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks,"" said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp. ""All ships experience some challenges,"" said Wetty, who traditionally books her customers on high-end cruises. ""It's all the recovery and how they treat the passengers and how they continue to build consumer confidence. ""For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits. For new cruisers, it puts a little doubt in their minds. "" Not every frequent Carnival cruiser is feeling so confident. ""I have cruised with Carnival on many occasions with my family. They were my [favorite] cruise line. That being said, I will stay on land from here on out,"" wrote one CNN.com commenter. ""Until they have a really really long period of time with no problems I will not consider cruising with them again. This is just way too much. The Concordia going down was bad enough, but all of these are just plain nonsense. It WILL hurt the cruise line."" Customers need to be reassured Carnival is doing everything it can to address its ships' issues, Wetty said. How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . Customers of canceled cruises complain . Current customers, some of whom have been posting on CNN.com, are having trouble reaching the company in some cases. ""What about those of us that got our cruise canceled?"" wrote one commenter, who said she was scheduled to sail on the Carnival Dream. ""I haven't heard anything from Carnival, and I don't know how long it will take to get a refund. Now we are stuck not knowing what to do for a vacation we saved 8 years to take!"" Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line. ""All three of my prior Carnival cruises were wonderful, food was outstanding, ports were well organized and safe, shipboard activities were plentiful, all for a small budget price,"" Hammond, a resident of Fort Madison, Iowa, wrote in an e-mail. ""I'm sure I could have paid $1,000 more per person and been impressed much more, but the Carnival cruise was a great vacation and a memorable fun time."" Hammond said she expects the recent incidents will be a wake-up call for Carnival's maintenance program, but she's not concerned about safety. She's already booked her next Carnival cruise, taking her 79-year-old mother and a girlfriend who has never been on a cruise. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court?",7,9.726386469689045
cc289c40e1bc21e5795cb18b6a292feabbe93d47,CNN,"(CNN)Police say she's at it again. ""Serial Stowaway"" Marilyn Jean Hartman has been caught doing what she appears to be good at, traveling for free. She is known for repeatedly trying to board flights in California and Arizona without a ticket -- and sometimes getting away with it.  This time she's flipped coasts and is under arrest in Florida. Hartman has been charged with fraud/impersonation, defrauding an innkeeper and trespassing and now has a complimentary room at the Nassau County Jail. Hartman's latest travelog begins in Minnesota, according to Bill Leeper at the Nassau County Sheriff's Office. She told deputies she traveled to Jacksonville on Sunday without a ticket.  Authorities are investigating whether she stowed away or not.  She did not give an airline name. Once in Jacksonville, she hopped a hotel transport to the Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort, about a 30-mile drive from the airport, where she checked into another person's room under her real name and paid with her own credit card. Hartman bolted when the person who had booked the room showed up.  She was found Monday, staying in another room at the resort that was being renovated. Hartman has been arrested numerous times for trying to sneak aboard airlines and staying in places without authorization. In August, she had two run-ins with authorities at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. On August 14, Hartman was given a warning for trying to enter a security checkpoint without a ticket. Twelve days later, she was arrested in an airport terminal for criminal trespass.  A day after that, Hartman was again seen loitering around a security checkpoint, Phoenix police said. Earlier that month, she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of stowing away a flight from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles International Airport, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. She was sentenced to two years probation and three days in jail. She was given credit for time served and released. Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security. ""I don't think it's wise to say how I got through. I don't want to help the enemy,"" she said. ""...I want to go with a paid ticket. ... I want to do everything legal,"" Hartman said. ""It was clearly wrong on my part. ... It was stupid and it is something I don't want to repeat."" A day later, Hartman was back at LAX and re-arrested. Hartman has long been described by authorities as a serial stowaway for repeatedly trying to board flights at San Francisco International Airport to Hawaii without a ticket. Earlier in 2014, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to stay away from the San Francisco airport. Hartman's first court appearance on the latest charges is scheduled for Tuesday.

7816db448228710cb0d05504fcd18b9101bac01f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Uniformed Egyptian police pull a woman in nothing but her underclothes from a frenzied mob. ""Get back boy! Get back!"" the officers say as one lifts his pistol into the air. Large patches of skin on the victim appear bloodied and raw as she struggles to walk toward a police van with hordes of men still fighting for a handful of her body. Moments later, she falls to the ground, naked. Police carry her into the vehicle, seemingly incapable of thwarting the crowd. In the background, revelers set off fireworks and wave flags to celebrate the election of Egypt's new president. This is just one of at least five mob sexual assaults that took place in Cairo's Tahrir Square in the past week, according to the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign, which documents sexual violence against women in Egypt. The attack is shown in a less than two-minute viral cell phone video that CNN cannot independently verify. It is unclear when the video was shot, but social media reports indicate the incident took place Tuesday after Egypt's election body announced Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won elections in a landslide. Days later, as the restive country celebrated the presidential inauguration, human rights groups documented more sexual assaults in Tahrir. ""It is shameful that the security leaders of the Ministry of Interior did not take into account any security measures or plans to prevent such incidents,"" a statement from the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign reads. ""Junior officers and individuals were left alone to face sexual harassment groups without any tools or plans."" Four of the five victims sexually assaulted in the square required medical attention, the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign said. The attacks against them were so ferocious that several officers deployed to rescue the women were themselves wounded by the crowd, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry on Monday. Police arrested seven men Monday on charges of sexual harassment after two women filed police reports and identified their attackers, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Video of one of the assaults was posted on YouTube and the video is a part of the ongoing investigation, said another official from the Interior Ministry, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The response by authorities did little to squelch anger on social media channels, where many criticized the authorities and criticized local media for a lack of professionalism. ""They are happy, huh?"" Maha Bahnassy said laughingly about the crowd on private network Tahrir TV during a live report on harassment from inside the square. Bahnassy publicly apologized Monday, saying her comments were misunderstood. Activists said the anchorwoman's jarring remarks appeared part of a general trend by Egypt's pro-military factions to sideline the systemic violence against women in favor of glorifying Egypt's new head of state, former army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The state-affiliated National Council of Women characterized Sunday night's violence as an orchestrated conspiracy against el-Sisi, saying, ""The acts were meant to spoil the joy of Egyptians and their wedding of democracy."" The group called on officials to find the ""masterminds."" ""Every day sexual harassment is a social epidemic affecting everyone, every day. Mob violence is an extreme form of this act that has been normalized by society,"" said Noora Flinkman, communication manager at HarassMap, a volunteer-based initiative aimed at combating sexual harassment. The group dismissed claims that the attacks were part of an organized political act against the new government. A 2013 United Nations report from the Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women found that 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment and more than 82% of female respondents felt unsafe in the street. The mass attacks come just days after Egypt passed the first law criminalizing sexual harassment, making it punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 50,000 Egyptian pounds. ""For a long time harassers have been able to harass with impunity. Now with this amendment to the law it is a good opportunity to take action not just in cases of mob assault but in cases of everyday sexual harassment,"" Flinkman said. ""We are waiting to see what steps the authorities will take.""",1,8.46682008061122
957a8894f6809515e5d77000d2ae15061ac127cb,CNN,"(CNN) -- The father of Haleigh Cummings, a Florida girl who disappeared in February, plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother, a key witness in the case, his attorneys told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Ronald Cummings plans to divorce his wife, Misty, his attorney says. The move follows weeks of reported tension between Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh, who was 5 when last seen. In papers expected to be filed Tuesday, Ronald Cummings, 25, cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17-year-old wife, said Terry Shoemaker, Ronald Cummings' attorney. Haleigh went missing from her father's home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance. Misty Cummings, then known as Misty Croslin, was the last person known to have seen Haleigh the night she disappeared from the family's rented mobile home. The teenager said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later, but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn. Investigators have said they do not feel Misty Cummings has told them everything she knows. ""The police have been telling me that I've been keeping Misty under my wing and that's why she hasn't talked to the cops,"" Ronald Cummings told a ""Nancy Grace"" producer Tuesday. ""So now, here you go, I divorced her. So now go find my baby.""  Watch Ronald Cummings speak to Nancy Grace » . The Putnam County Sheriff's office said in August that ""the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that Haleigh's disappearance is the work of a stranger."" Ronald Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, Haleigh's mother, are not considered suspects, police said. ""Investigators believe that Misty Croslin-Cummings continues to hold important answers in the case,"" the sheriff's office said in a written statement. ""She has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of Haleigh's disappearance. Furthermore, physical evidence at the scene contradicts Misty's sketchy account of her evening activities."" Shoemaker said his client told Misty Cummings he wanted a divorce on Sunday, and that the a divorce agreement was drawn up Monday. The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature. ""He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'"" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. ""My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them."" Misty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them. Asked what he thought the divorce would mean for the search for Haleigh, he said, ""Probably nothing."" ""You have to understand that ever since Haleigh went missing, they have been scrutinized,"" Beardsley said of the Cummingses. ""They can't go out to dinner, can't even go to the convenience store to get a drink. ... The pressure of everything that is going on, the allegations and speculation, has been a stress on the relationship. The two lived together for about six months before marrying in March. The divorce agreement provides no financial terms, according to Shoemaker. On Monday, Misty Cummings left Satsuma to stay with a friend in Orlando, 50 miles south, Shoemaker said.",1,10.540496771777068
ff5b0492c6aa8f64dcd4934d2eabe588a682f7a9,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- American-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country, President Barack Obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on Thursday. Taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the Caymen Islands and Bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the United States, Obama will call on Congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government's fingers. A White House official, previewing Obama's remarks, said the President would make the case on Thursday that tax-avoiding companies ""are essentially renouncing their American citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America."" The White House has aimed this week to advance the President's domestic agenda, focusing on jobs programs and the economy. Bolstering the middle class has formed much of Obama's midterm election year pitch. But world events -- including Israel's ground invasion of Gaza and furor over the downed airliner in Ukraine -- have largely overshadowed the intended topics this week, despite the White House's attempts to highlight new job training measures. Obama's remarks Thursday, which he'll deliver at a technical college in downtown Los Angeles, come at the end of a three-day fundraising swing which also brought him to Seattle and the Silicon Valley. The event will be the only public showing for Obama during his stay on the West Coast. He withstood some criticism for not canceling the trip, which aides countered by saying the president could conduct his job from anywhere. The White House did, however, nix an appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" replacing the late night show with a more sober CNBC interview. Obama will touch on an issue Democrats believe could help them win over voters in this year's midterm contests. The President has long decried the inherent unfairness in large, multimillion dollar corporations that operate chiefly in the United States but pay little in U.S. taxes. He used the issue to attack Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Both Republicans and Democrats say the entire tax code needs an overhaul, but Obama is pressing lawmakers to take action now to prevent so-called ""inversions,"" which allow U.S. companies to merge with foreign firms in countries with lower tax rates. In the past decade, at least 47 U.S. companies have made the move. Several inversions have been proposed this year and more are in the works. ""We should prevent companies from effectively renouncing their citizenship to get out of paying taxes. What we need is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise and fall together,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew In a letter to lawmakers last week, adding he believed any new measure should prevent companies from gaining tax advantages by incorporating overseas. Lew said a new law should retroactively bar any firm that moved abroad after May 2014 from enjoying lower tax liabilities. CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.",0,7.951335415967835
fe720f8154533f9bea52e9ff5e08c289d4b86dd2,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""She has an incredible legacy,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard tweeted. The Labor leader wasn't talking about Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, whose funeral on Wednesday was dominating headlines around the world -- she was referring to a race horse. Accolades have been streaming in for Australia's champion mare Black Caviar as the horse was retired after an impressive undefeated 25-win career. ""It's emotional, a lot of people are in shock,"" co-owner Colin Madden told CNN. ""She's a remarkable horse with a remarkable career and it just seemed that the time was right."" ""In my lifetime, she's certainly the greatest race horse I've ever seen."" The six-year-old sprinter, worth almost $8 million in prize money, bowed out after claiming her quarter century victory at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes on Saturday. It marks the end of a record-breaking career for the ""Wonder from Down Under"" who transcended the sports pages to become one of the country's most beloved sporting celebrities. The super mare wasn't just a powerhouse on the track -- she was a treasured personality who appeared on the cover of Vogue, launched a best-selling biography and was named Sportswoman of the Year by Sydney's Daily Telegraph. Unsurprisingly, the retirement of the world's top-rated racehorse led news bulletins in Australia, with Gillard tweeting: ""We've never seen anything like Black Caviar before and may never again. She has an incredible legacy."" Similarly, Australian Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbott tweeted: ""Congratulations Black Caviar. You've done Australia proud, both here and overseas. A remarkable racing career."" The mare's retirement ensured journalists rushed to the stables of Melbourne trainer Peter Moody. ""At the end of the day we believe she's done everything we've asked her to do and she could possibly have done no more,"" Moody told the media throng. ""It's a job well done, and something we can all be extremely proud of. She really gave her all and we thought what else can we achieve? She's been a great shining light for racing."" Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, an air of mystique has followed the world champion thoroughbred. The wonder mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 25 of her races -- with the exception of Britain's Royal Ascot she has won them by staggering margins -- destroying world-class fields to become one of the world's top-rated race horses. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Black Caviar will now enjoy around three weeks to ""take it easy,"" said Madden, before embarking on the next lucrative chapter of her career. ""She'll spend some time in a grass paddock under the sun and the stars,"" he said. ""This is the end of her racing career and the start of her new life as a breeding mare."" ""We'll make a decision sometime in the next two months but at this stage it's most likely she'll stay in Australia."" There had been speculation Black Caviar would mate with champion British thoroughbred, Frankel. The colt, who wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot with an unblemished 14-win record, has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. Madden didn't rule out the possibility of a ""Brangelina"" courtship for the racing supercouple, saying ""He's an extraordinary horse and it could be a wonderful match -- but nothing's been decided and it's something we're still assessing."" One thing however, is for certain -- in her four-year career the unbeatable horse with a luxury name cemented her place in the record books and the hearts of a nation. BBC racing journalist Frank Keogh perhaps summed up her appeal best: ""Built like a bulldozer, performed like a ballerina - Black Caviar is a racing champion who became a cover star.""",7,10.11484421507452
36e591a9fafb842c1faefbaa9e3b2eaf2379e6df,CNN,"(CNN) -- The final, violent moments in the life of their son, Trayvon Martin, no longer dominate the national news, as they once did. Tens of thousands no longer attend rallies demanding justice for the slain teenager; pundits no longer debate the case on every media platform imaginable. What once had been the big story has increasingly become yesterday's news. But Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin haven't stopped fighting. One year ago Tuesday, they were grieving and relatively anonymous parents, trying to come to grips with the sudden death of their 17-year-old son. But in time, they became celebrities of sorts in a world of gun violence and vigilante justice. To their supporters, they were the faces and the voices of victims of racial profiling. Talk Back: One year later, what have we learned? While the spotlight largely has faded since then, they say their commitment has not. ""We (want to) make sure that no other parents have to go through what we have gone through in the last year,"" Fulton told CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night. On February 26, 2012, her teenage son was walking back to the Sanford, Florida, home of his father's fiancee after picking up some Skittles and an iced tea at 7-Eleven. That's when, and where, then-28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman spotted him. What happened the night Trayvon Martin died . What happened between then and when Zimmerman fatally shot the teen is subject to dispute, one that could be settled by a jury starting June 10, when Zimmerman is set to go on trial on a second-degree murder charge. As the prosecution and defense lawyers battled in court in the weeks and months that followed, Trayvon Martin's parents became less visible on the national scene. But they've still been active, said Fulton, including continuing to work on behalf of the Justice for Trayvon Martin Foundation, which they started. They held a benefit dinner for the nonprofit organization, as well as a peace walk in Miami ""to let teenagers know they have a right to walk in peace,"" she said Monday. On Tuesday, the anniversary of their son's death, they'll be in New York for a candlelight vigil. Five things to know . Their efforts include continuing to speak out on issues. Among them is gun violence, a debate over which is brewing in Washington and nationwide after several grisly mass shootings, including one that left 20 children and 6 adults dead at a Connecticut elementary school last December. ""It's just too much senseless violence; it's overwhelming the homes right now,"" Tracy Martin said Monday, referring to the Newtown massacre as well as murders in places like Chicago. ""We, as parents, certainly feel the pain."" Even as they continue to fight, Trayvon Martin's parents acknowledge that -- after months in the spotlight, trying to ramp up pressure on authorities to go after Zimmerman -- much about their son's case is now out of their hands. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, on Monday asked rhetorically if Zimmerman is ""not held accountable, what message does that send to the next child that's killed, unarmed, on the ground?"" Still, Sybrina Fulton said that, to a large extent, she and her ex-husband have gotten what they asked for. Zimmerman was arrested and, unless something unforeseen happens, he will stand trial. Opinion: What we can learn from Trayvon Martin shooting . ""We just want to have that trial, and let the jury decide,"" she said. ""And whatever decision comes out of that, we're going to accept that. ""We may not like it, but we're going to accept it."" The jury will have to decide between two starkly different versions of what happened that night. Zimmerman told police that, after the two exchanged words, Martin went after him. According to his account, the teen, who didn't have any weapons on him, punched him, forced him to the ground, and slammed his head on the concrete. That's when Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense, he claims. Martin's family and supporters, though, have long had a different story. One of the first to tell it was Tracy Martin, who initially addressed reporters last March 8, trying to raise the case's profile and hike pressure on authorities. He and, soon, others suggested Zimmerman had targeted his son, an African-American youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt, because of his race. Timeline of events in the Trayvon Martin case . The parents' legion of supporters grew exponentially as the weeks wore on after the shooting, with no one charged. They created a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it was the second most-popular petition in the website's history, with 877,110 signatures. Protests drawing thousands of people sprung up nationwide demanding ""Justice for Trayvon"" and blasting local authorities' response. As their reason for not immediately arresting Zimmerman, police cited Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which states that people who feel threatened don't have to retreat from danger and can use deadly force to protect themselves. Zimmerman was charged on April 11, with a probable cause affidavit stating he ""profiled"" Martin and disregarded a 911 dispatcher's request that he wait for police. The weeks that followed produced more news. For example, Zimmerman posted $150,000 bail, only to have it revoked after the judge said he'd mislead the court about his financial situation, including tens of thousands of dollars he'd raised online for his defense fund.

de2e8fdfee1807548fd4168bdb129845cbc0f16a,CNN,"(CNN) -- To fully appreciate all the A350 XWB promises to offer, your imagination needs to take a rather giant leap. On display for the first time at an airshow, the brand new extra wide bodied passenger jet has been one of the Singapore Airshow's major attention grabbers. Flying high above the Changi Exhibition Centre, it looks sleek and maneuverable. It's a big draw, part of the airshow's static display sitting beside its key competitor, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. But step on board, and it's unlike any other experience on a passenger jet, because the A350 is still a test aircraft. Packed with flight testing gear, including the equivalent of 400 kilometers of bright orange testing cables, every nuance of what happens when the plane is in the air is captured by equipment that feeds data live to Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse. Some 600,000 parameters can be monitored and recorded at any one time as part of that testing. Large water tanks under the floor are filled to the exact weight the aircraft will carry when it's full of passengers and baggage. The A350 first took to the skies on June 14 last year. Soon after, it performed a fly-by at the Paris Airshow. So far two test planes have clocked 1,000 hours of flying time, some in extreme conditions. To date the A350 has experienced the cold of northern Canada and the high altitude of La Paz in Bolivia. In the next few weeks it will also conduct tests in the stifling heat of the Middle East. All five test A350s will have to fly for 2,500 hours before achieving certification. Selling features . This is a passenger jet made up of 53% composite material according to Simon Azar from the Airbus Marketing Division, the highest of any commercial aircraft. This allows the A350 to travel as fuel efficiently as possible, lowering operating costs. The wings of the jet incorporate the jet maker's latest aerodynamics and advanced low-speed controls. The curled winglets are designed to reduce drag, again saving fuel. Essentially the plane will fly further for less, to help offset the high cost of buying the aircraft, which has a list price of $254 million-322 million depending on size. Also adding to the customer experience, Airbus says, are the A350's low noise levels. This airplane has already been nicknamed by some as the ""Hushliner,"" a title Airbus has embraced. ""The noise levels for the aircraft are going to be very low,"" says Azar. ""It's designed to be a very quiet aircraft both in the cabin and for surrounding space as the aircraft flies around. That's very important. Noise pollution around airports is something that we work to reduce."" Airbus also says its custom Rolls Royce engine is unrivaled in terms of fuel efficiency, and contributes to the aircraft achieving a 25% reduction in seat-mile costs and 25% lower carbon dioxide emissions. Passenger experience . For passengers, Airbus says it's offering great quality air (replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes), wider cabins and 18-inch-wide seats in economy. When carrying 315 passengers this plane can travel 7,800 nautical miles, or an equivalent 17 hours, useful when research suggests passengers of the future will be flying for longer. The twin aisle jet can carry between 250 and 400 passengers. It's designed to have an economy class carrying nine abreast, but the A350 will come in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000, and can be configured to seat passengers from eight to 10 abreast. It'll be up to the customer airlines to choose the mode of inflight entertainment. Business class passengers will experience all the perks, with Airbus promising mood lighting and the option for full flat seats. First class can be fitted at the customer airline's discretion. It's a lot to get your head around when you look at the airplane as it is today. ""Flight crew class"" is what Azar laughingly calls the 50 odd well-worn gray seats the jet is currently fitted with, all recovered from old aircraft. For now, these are strictly reserved for crew and mechanics during test flights, but that will change. The first fit-out of an A350 with a proper cabin is expected next month. VIPs and media only . The A350 arrived in Singapore shortly before the airshow started. Only a select few have been allowed inside, including aviation journalists and VIP visitors, including Britain's Undersecretary of State for Transport Stephen Hammond. On Thursday the plane is due to fly 13 hours back to Toulouse, where rigorous tests will continue until the plane is ready to go to market. Airbus says it expects that to be in the fourth quarter of this year. Its debut customer, Qatar Airways, has ordered 80 of the aircraft. Airbus has a backlog of orders for 814 A350 jets, from 39 customers, almost a third of which are from the Asia Pacific region.

276ccd5a2502dd58453ae37b5b63a8f5f63b7861,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Cristie Kerr is the first player from the United States to top the women's world rankings after her runaway victory in the LPGA Championship at Locust Hill Country Club in New York. Kerr carded a six-under final round 66 for a 19-under 269 total, leaving her 12 shots clear of the best in women's golf. It was a record victory margin in the LPGA Championship, beating the 11-shot win for fellow American Betsy King in 1992. Kerr was claiming her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour and winning her second major after the 2007 U.S. Open. She led from start to finish as rounds of 68, 66 and 69 left her eight shots clear going into Sunday's final round. ""It's a dream performance,"" Kerr told the official LPGA Tour website. ""It's like you wake up or you dream -- I can't even speak right now. Winning by two or three is great, but winning by 12 shots is ridiculous. It's obscene."" Kerr made sure of her victory by following six straight pars with three birdies in four holes around the turn. South Korea's Kim Song-Hee finished second with Japan's Ai Miyazato tied for third with South Korea's Shin Jiyai. Miyazato still leads the official money list after winning four times this season, but Kerr has overtaken her at the top of the official world rankings. She went into the major in fifth spot. Miyazato, who needed to finish in second place to keep top spot was impressed with Kerr's performance. ""That's almost too good,"" Miyazato said. ""She's just amazing. I played really good, too, but she is just better than me."" The close race for world number one will continue at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic in Ohio next weekend, but Kerr will skip the tournament to rest ahead of the U.S. Women's Open on July 8. Kerr is fully aware she will now come under pressure for the top ranking. ""I'm there now, but I have to prove that I deserve to be there,"" Kerr said. ""So there is still a lot of work ahead.

847afadba9c2177c2a6433863bd64724d6929519,CNN,"(CNN) -- Actor Edward James Olmos wishes he could trace his family's Mexican history back 100,000 years, but he'll have to settle for 1930 for now. In what one online genealogy firm say is an extraordinary trove of data for American families of Latino descent, the complete 1930 Mexican census is being distributed publicly for the first time. It's considered a rich mine of information because that year's census is Mexico's earliest, most accurate accounting of its population, with 90% of its people counted, according to the firm Ancestry.com. That sort of family lore -- compiled just after Mexico recovered from its tumultuous, bloody Revolution of 1910-20 -- not only piques the interest of prominent Latinos such as Olmos but also stands to sate the curiosity of 31.9 million U.S. Hispanics of Mexican descent. America's own 2010 census just elevated Latinos to the No. 2 group for the first time. The 1930 Mexican census is so antique that it consists of nearly 13 million hard-copy pages, with rows and columns filled out by hand in florid penmanship. The handwriting evokes a bygone era dramatically at odds with the digital age that is making those documents available for free on Ancestry.com. Other genealogy firms have put pieces of the census online, but Ancestry.com says it's providing the entire 1930 census online for the first time, spokesman Sean Pate said. ""This is the most important document we have for Mexican-American people in this country,"" Olmos said in an interview with CNN. The Oscar-nominated actor is working with the online firm to trace his family's Mexican history. Like the waves of European immigrants before them, many Latinos have only oral histories of their origins, Olmos said. The 31.8 million Americans of Mexican descent account for most of the country's 50.5 million Hispanics, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. ""Short of the verbal history that went from person to person, family to family, we really never knew more than that,"" Olmos said. ""This is the first time we've had a document. ""For me, it's building my self-esteem and self-respect as to who I am and for the people who sacrificed for me to be where I am. Now I know who they are and what are their names. Now you want to know more about those people. I would like to go back 100,000 years if I could,"" Olmos said. Mexico's 1895 census is considered the country's first national census, but those records aren't available to the public and aren't considered as complete as the 1930 census, said representatives for Ancestry.com, which claims to be the largest online family history resource. The 1900, 1910 and 1920 censuses aren't regarded as complete and reliable as the 1930 census -- officially called ""El Quinto Censo General de Poblacion y Vivienda 1930, Mexico,"" or the Fifth General Census of Population and Housing, according to Ancestry.com's representatives. The 1930 census doesn't include citizens from the federal district, which includes Mexico City, but it's historically significant because it marks how federal officials sought to make it a vehicle for national unity, said officials with the online firm. An ""aggressive propaganda campaign"" emphasizing the civic duty to participate in the census resulted in the ""extremely high participation rate,"" and that's why the 1930 count is considered the best Mexican census of the 20th century, the online firm said. The records list the names of persons in a household and contain many fields of information: Name, age, gender, birthplace, address, marital status, nationality, religion, occupation, real estate holdings, literacy, any physical or mental defects and even any Indian language spoken. Ancestry.com says the 13 million records reveal several facets about Mexico in 1930: . The most common female name was Maria, and the most common male name was Juan. The three most common surnames were Hernandez, Garcia and Martinez. Famous Mexicans in the census include Maria Felix (1914--2002), who was among the best-known Mexican actresses, and Carmello Torres Fregoso (Bernardo del Carmen Fregoso Cazares; 1927-2003), a renowned bullfighter who later became a successful businessman, the company said. Nearly 18% of the population were recorded as ""soltero"" (single); 11% were ""casado por lo civil y la iglesia"" (civil and church marriage); 10% were ""casado por la iglesia"" (church marriage); and 8% were ""union libre"" (free union, or living together without marriage). The four most populous Mexican states were Puebla, Veracruz, Jalisco and Oaxaca. ""As the United States is home to the second-largest Mexican community in the world, Mexican-Americans comprise 10% of the total U.S. population. Therefore, it is fitting that the world's largest online family history resource now has an expansive collection to serve this important demographic,"" said Josh Hanna, Ancestry.com executive vice president, in a statement. The firm announced the free availability of the documents on its website this month because it's National Hispanic Heritage Month. Olmos said the 1930 census would make genealogical research easier and more reliable -- especially because records haven't been evenly maintained in Mexico's history. For example, Olmos spent eight years trying to find his father's birth certificate in Mexico, he said. In the end, he never found the birth certificate, but he did find ""a birth memoir inside a hospital"" that noted his father's birth in Mexico City in 1922, Olmos said. ""He walked out of the hospital and someone marked it down. That's how we got him,"" Olmos said of his father's birth. Olmos, who himself was born in Los Angeles in 1947, used that hospital memoir for his father's birth to obtain dual citizenship with Mexico several years ago, he said. Olmos' mother was also born in Los Angeles, so securing his father's Mexican birth record was critical to Olmos' quest to obtain a second, Mexican citizenship, he said. The 1930 census could streamline such family research, he said. ""This is where I believe people will gain strength. As soon as you start to investigate, it's like a mystery,"" Olmos said. ""My mother, who's 85, knows quite a bit, but we're now finding about aunts and uncles and grandparents. That's exciting. It really empowers us.""",0,11.246530232808192

74109de4e0fcfa67e4b093a54b884564bec78b76,CNN,"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A huge mural greets visitors to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. It's a memorial to the building's namesake, who died unexpectedly in 1993. Hundreds of tiles are used to create the ""magic"" mural at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. A young Reggie Lewis, wearing his  No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey, dominates the middle of the 11-foot-by-14-foot artwork. At the bottom left is a picture of him and his wife. To his right, the face of legendary Celtic Larry Bird. But as young men in sweats and sneakers make their way into the gym, something strange happens. The mural comes alive. The photo of a beaming Lewis in formal attire transforms into Lewis the basketball player, streaking down the court. Larry Bird's picture morphs into that of another famous player, Robert Parrish. With each step, the mural transforms, representing the many scenes in one man's life. Artist Rufus B. Seder calls these ""movies for a wall"" Lifetiles. The Massachusetts artist invented the Lifetiles medium and is the only artist in the world using it. He has more than 30 Lifetiles installations around the globe.  Watch a magic mural in action » . At the Taiwan Aquarium, dolphins swim on the wall alongside awestruck children. Bucking broncos line the halls of the the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. Dancers spin and twirl along with passengers on luxury cruise ships in the south of France. And Seder calls the the South San Francisco, California, BART station his ""own personal gallery,"" with more than 16 installations. Lifetiles don't use electricity, moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston. ""What I'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise,"" he said. Scanimation on the shelf . If the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar, you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore. The popular children's books ""Gallop!"" and ""Swing!"" were also written and illustrated by Seder. With a technique he calls scanimation, pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page. It's a kids' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy, too, based on sales numbers. ""Swing!"" and ""Gallop!"" are currently on The New York Times bestseller list. Seder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country. Then Workman Publishing came calling, asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye-catching technique. That's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle. After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist, he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers. Just a few years later, there are over 2 million copies of ""Gallop!"" in print in more than 13 languages. Still awed by their popularity, Seder said, ""I would've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well. It totally blew my mind what happened."" Although his books' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity, the Lifetiles are truly his life's work. The relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art isn't new at all. Seder's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years, inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster. ""I started making movies when I was 12 years old,"" he said, ""so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye."" How does it work? As a viewer, you don't have to learn how to see a Lifetile. It's intuitive, and one immediately understands the concept. As you walk past the mural, it begins to move along with you. But the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is, ""How does it work?"" ""The short answer is, it's magic,"" Seder said. ""The longer answer is, it's like a flipbook. I've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together, and I've put them up on the wall and made them animate."" The lengthy process also requires attention to detail. Much like an animator, he creates a series of drawings on his computer. He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines. This squiggly-lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative. The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand-cast glass tile made in Seder's studio. The heavy, 8-inch-square glass tiles get painted, scraped, fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural. Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall. Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists wouldn't have his patience, even if they had his know-how. ""It's not that I've been playing my cards close to my vest,"" he said. ""It's just very difficult to do."" A Lifetiles installation, from conception to completion, can take up to a year to complete. It's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his ""magic"" walls. ""I love to watch people react to the work. They don't expect a wall to move,"" he said. ""They'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize, 'Those dolphins are starting to move next to me! How is that possible?'

9d7d70260d82f917be258093478ba10a33bddea6,CNN,"(CNN) -- A preliminary autopsy on the body of an energy executive pulled from the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, this week revealed a head laceration and evidence of drowning, investigators said Thursday. The body was found Tuesday, four days after Douglas Schantz, president of Houston, Texas-based Sequent Energy Management, disappeared. A toxicology report, due back in roughly three weeks, will show ""how much Schantz had to drink before falling into the Mississippi"" last week, said John Gagliano, lead investigator at the New Orleans coroner's office. Authorities recovered Schantz's body around noon Tuesday, said police spokesman Gary Flot. Police said Schantz was found with all his personal belongings, including his wallet, credit cards, identification and jewelry. Schantz, 54, was last seen outside a Bourbon Street bar at 2:06 a.m. Friday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Warren Riley told reporters Tuesday morning. No one had heard from him since then. At the Tuesday morning news conference, Riley said detectives reviewed video from ""almost every"" business in the busy French Quarter. Several cameras captured a ""disoriented"" Schantz walking alone from a bar toward the Mississippi River, Riley said. Schantz had been drinking, Riley said, and was headed toward a boat at the wharf. ""The last video of Mr. Schantz is when he was near the boat Natchez, walking on a 2- to 3-foot-wide walkway near the river,"" Riley said. ""From 2:40 until 6:40 a.m. video was watched and ... once he [Schantz] walked out of that frame near the Natchez, he never returned on any frames of the video."" Riley said that according to the video, no one approached Schantz during the walk. Texas Equusearch, a search-and-rescue team, searched the waters with sonar equipment, and the Coast Guard and Harbor Police had also joined the search, according to Riley. Family and friends said they knew something was wrong Friday morning when Schantz didn't show up at the airport, missed a company meeting, and didn't return calls. Such behavior, they said, was uncharacteristic of him. ""There's never been a time he was out of reach,"" said Pete Tumminello, vice president of Sequent Energy, on Monday. ""I've worked with him for seven years. There's never been a time he's been out of reach."" Schantz missed a flight Friday morning with his daughter, a Tulane University senior, police said. He also did not show up for an office meeting in Houston. Schantz went to the French Quarter with friends on Thursday night, Sequent Energy spokesman Alan Chapple told CNN on Tuesday. They went there after an earlier event at Tulane University to present a $25,000 donation to the Tulane Energy Institute, Chapple said. Schantz and his colleagues had dinner with professors and students at the school, and later he and some others went to the bar. Schantz was staying at the Royal Sonesta Hotel, only about two blocks from the bar that he was seen leaving, Chapple said. Members of the party had left the establishment at varying times, he said. During their investigation, police had not discovered any evidence of a crime, Flot said Tuesday morning. The FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and private investigators were also working the case, Riley said. Schantz's son, Michael, described Monday the agony his family was feeling as they awaited news. ""My family is distraught, I'm distraught, [in] shock,"" he said. ""We just want him found alive and back with our family.""

a0d5e81f754d756307b6444ab49896fef1cc0f70,CNN,"(CNN) -- An old meatpacking plant on Chicago's South Side is being transformed into an eco farm, which its founders says will produce food sustainably, while creating zero waste. American entrepreneur John Edel is the founder of ""The Plant,"" a vertical-farm initiative that he hopes will show people the ease of adapting to green food production in urban living environments. A vertical farm is an urban agriculture concept whereby food is grown in and on top of buildings in city areas. In order for this process to work, urban farmers use a variety of techniques, including hydroponics -- cultivating plants in water -- and aquaponics, which uses by-products from fish farming to assist hydroponic growth. With the world's population surpassing seven billion people and the rapid pace of urbanization, finding space to grow food is becoming an increasing challenge -- one that Edel and his team of volunteers at The Plant are rising to. Watch: A farm on every roof top . In 2010 Edel began repurposing the meatpacking plant and two years on it has opened its doors to both the public, and business opportunities. Edel says of The Plant's ethos: ""It started out minimal (waste) because that's how I've always operated ... Using as little resource as possible to do things. At a certain point I realized if we built an anaerobic digester, we could get our waste down to zero."" The Plant's anaerobic digester uses bacteria to break down organic waste into biogas -- comprised of methane and carbon dioxide -- and material that can be used as fertilizer. A ""combined heat and power system"" will convert the methane into energy, which Edel says will take The Plant completely off grid and allow it to produce large quantities of food with zero waste output. Despite still being under construction The Plant currently has five tenants, including aquaponic farms, a hydroponic farm, bakers, tilapia fish breeders, a mushroom garden and a kombucha tea brewer (a type of tea said to have health benefits). Their products are sold to local restaurants, cafes and markets, as well as used to produce more food within the farm itself. Read more: Futuristic farm shop grows food in synthetic veg patch . Recycling is also a big part of the inner workings of The Plant and tenants work with each other to use their waste output in their food production and farming techniques. For example, the tilapia fish produce ammonia-based waste, which is sent through a biofilter before the nitrates are fed to plants growing in hydroponic beds. The plants absorb the nitrates, cleaning the water, which is then returned to the fish in an example of a ""completed loop cycle."" Edel says: ""The key to this farm is the closing of loops: energy loops; resource loops; money loops -- by keeping jobs local. If you can close the loops, you can make things more sustainable."" Supported by $1.5 million in grant money from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, The Plant operates under a social-enterprise model, with a non-profit side and a for-profit side. It provides tours of the facility for interested members of the public and conduct lectures, outreach programs and demonstrations for the local community to show them how to grow food in various urban environments. Edel hopes to have the farm fully operational by 2014 and says that the facility will create 125 new local jobs.",2,8.359729203780466

b307d01e422309942533d633b2289ab59e740ac7,CNN,"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- A pregnant British woman facing possible execution in Laos will go on trial this week, the country's foreign affairs ministry said Monday. Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison, according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve. Samantha Orobator ""is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking,"" said Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, a London-based human rights group. Orobator, 20, was arrested on August 5, said Khenthong Nuanthasing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman. She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram (1.1 pounds) of heroin, Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. ""For that amount of heroin the sentence is normally the death penalty,"" she said. Orobator's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested, her mother said. Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office, which has been monitoring the case, the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin, where she lives. She cannot believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking, and was surprised to learn she was in Laos, she said. ""I don't know"" what she was doing there, she said. ""The last time she spoke with me, she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the U.K. in July. ""She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs,"" she added. Reprieve is worried about her health, especially given her pregnancy, Anna Morris said. ""She became pregnant in prison. We are concerned that it may not have been consensual and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation,"" she said. She is due to give birth in September, the lawyer added. Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator, Algar said. The lawyer arrived there on Sunday and is hoping to visit Orobator on Tuesday, her boss at Reprieve said. A British consul has also arrived in the country. ""Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago. We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today,"" Algar said Monday. ""We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to."" ""I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her,"" Morris said. ""She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her. We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one."" She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial. The last execution in Laos was in 1990, the foreign affairs spokesman said. British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday. ""The British Government is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. We have made the Laos authorities aware of this at the highest levels in Samantha's case,"" he said. ""We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case. British Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, have visited her six times since her arrest,"" he said. ""In addition, Britain's consular representatives in Laos, the Australian Embassy, including the Australian Embassy doctor, have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf,"" he said. There is no British Embassy in Laos. A British vice-consul arrived in the country this weekend, the Foreign Office said Monday. Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week, he said.

5a56b3ffc3754c59c6a0422ea0b0ae027c741337,CNN,"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer drained a crucial birdie putt on the 18th green Saturday to hold a commanding five-shot lead going into the final round of the U.S. Open in North Carolina. It gave Kaymer a battling third round of two-over 72 for eight-under 202 as the German seeks his second major title. American pair Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton both shot best of the day three-under-par 67s to take closer order to the runaway leader. Nobody else bettered par with testing pin positions set by officials. 2010 PGA Championship winner Kaymer had started the third round with a six stroke lead after reaching halfway with a record 10-under total of 130 at Pinehurst No.2. Behind Fowler and Compton it was Swede Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson, who both carded level-par 70s, to stand two-under 208 and maintain slim hopes of lifting the trophy. Kaymer, bidding to become the first man to win the Players Championship and the U.S. Open in the same year, recovered from two early bogeys by eagling the par-5 fifth hole. But missing fairways, he made three bogeys to come back toward the pack until holing from eight foot on the last for a morale-boosting birdie. ""It was good. I didn't play as well as the first two days, but I kept it together,"" Kaymer told the PGA Tour website. ""The USGA put the pins in very, very difficult positions."" Behind the leaders, Phil Mickelson's hopes of completing a career grand slam ended with a two-over 72 for five over. ""If I hit it better and make some putts, I think I can shoot four or five under par, end around even, finish second again,"" he joked in a reference to his six runner-up spots in the only major to elude him. Defending champion Justin Rose of England moved into a tie for 10th, with rising star Jordan Spieth also on that mark, after a fine level-par 70 for one-over 211, but still nine shots behind Kaymer.",7,9.057057386988049
8a8a442b7a2cebad8b902be7195203f2e5dfa36c,CNN,"(CNN) -- Shortly after Alabama's rout of Notre Dame there was one word that many on the field seemed not to want to broach. Dynasty. But why not? Alabama's 42 to 14 thrashing of Notre Dame in Monday night's BCS National Championship game was the Crimson Tide's second in a row. It is also Alabama's third national title in the last four years. Isn't this a dynasty, a reporter asked Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron, moments after he led his team to the win? ""You can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort,"" McCarron said. Alabama coach Nick Saban also shied away from the D- word during a news conference after the game. ""I don't think words like dynasty are words that I have much interest in. That is for other people to speak about,"" Saban said. And many on social media were. ""I really believe that this is, in my lifetime, the best dynasty that I've ever seen in college football,"" ESPN personality Kirk Herbstreit tweeted about Alabama. Herbstreit's comment was retweeted thousands of times. In fact, ""#Dynasty"" was trending in many regions in the United States early Tuesday morning as Crimson Tide fans partied in the streets of Tuscaloosa. With the win, Alabama joins college football royalty. The team joins Nebraska, in the '90s, and Notre Dame, in the '40s, as the only teams to win three championships in four years. When Nebraska did it, they shared the 1997 championship with Michigan. And to add to Alabama's legacy, none of the championship games were really close. In 2010, Alabama stomped Texas 37 to 21. Last year, the Tide blanked LSU 21 to 0. And this year, the championship game felt like it was over at halftime. Game? What game? There's a pretty woman in the stands! The No. 2 Crimson Tide scored on drives of 82, 61 and 80 yards against the top-ranked and undefeated Irish in its first three drives of the game. They drove 71-yards and scored with 31 seconds left in the half to take a dominating 28-0 lead. By that time, despite the fact that half of the game was yet to be played, many of those commenting on Twitter were jokingly wondering if Notre Dame would come out of the locker room for the second half. The Irish did, but it did not get much better for them. In fact, one of the biggest hits of the game on Alabama's quarterback McCarron came from his own teammate, Barrett Jones. The two teammates disagreed on a play call and had to call a timeout to get it cleared up. McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game. Notre Dame also couldn't stop Alabama's running game. Crimson Tide runners Eddie Lacy and T.J. Yeldon both ran for more than 100 yards. Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team had a lot to learn from Alabama. ""We are not there yet,"" Kelly said. ""Alabama showed us that in the way they played the game. We got a lot of work left to do to get back here."" But there was one player from Alabama who was ready to put the crown on. ""I think I can use the word dynasty now,"" said linebacker Nico Johnson, shortly after the confetti fell on the field.

2662e5ef8c2bb1328b6b73d2a618ff8608998876,CNN,"(CNN) -- Police in Oakland, California, took a 43-year-old former student at a small religious college into custody Monday after a shooting spree at the school that left seven dead and three wounded, the city's police chief said. The motive behind the killings at Oikos University in East Oakland remained a mystery Monday night, Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told reporters. Detectives had not yet questioned the suspect, identified as One Goh, and no charges had been filed, he said. ""With a case of this magnitude, with all the victims and witnesses and all the chaos, it's going to take a few days to put the pieces together,"" Jordan said. The college, which caters to the Korean American Christian community, offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said most of the victims appeared to be from the city's Korean-American community, and the city was working to find multilingual counselors to help survivors. ""No American mayor wants to have this situation,"" she said. ""It seems over the last decade, we've gotten used to seeing senseless mass killings like this, and we'll have to question the availability of guns and the need for other services in our community."" What is Oikos University? Gunfire erupted inside the single-story building that houses the private Christian college about 10:30 a.m. A witness, Brian Snow, said he was at a nearby credit union when shots rang out, ""and it started getting chaotic."" ""In Oakland, sometimes things like that happen, but it dies over,"" he said. But this time, he said, ""I went outside and the cops were coming and like 'Don't move, don't move,' and it started getting chaotic ... a pedestrian came out with a bullet hole and I was like, 'Getting really crazy right now.' "" Lucas Garcia, who was teaching an English class at the college when the rampage began, told CNN affiliate KGO-TV that he counted about six gunshots from a nearby nursing classroom. Garcia said he heard someone yell, ""He's got a gun,"" and he got his students out of the building while the gunfire continued. Jordan said the relationship between the suspect and any of those shot remained unknown Monday night, as detectives combed over ""a very bloody scene with lots of evidence."" ""Initially, we were told he was in a classroom when he stood up and began shooting at the victims,"" Jordan said. Several of the survivors, including the wounded, hid behind locked doors or desks as the shooting went on. The suspect took one of the victims' cars and drove off, but surrendered to police at a Safeway grocery in the Oakland suburb of Alameda a short time later, Jordan said. California Gov. Jerry Brown, who served as Oakland's mayor from 1999 to 2007, called the killings ""shocking and sad."" ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and friends and the entire community affected by this senseless act of violence,"" Brown said in a statement issued by his office.

9616868f0ed7b21e1726569a078c797b51cd166f,CNN,"Northern Tanzania (CNN) -- One could classify the Hadza people as a throwback. Numbering a mere 1,300, they represent one of the last communities of hunter-gatherers in the world. Their language -- which includes click consonants -- is unrelated to any other on Earth, and is possibly one of the oldest spoken languages in existence. Their DNA, too, suggests an ancient heritage, easily 100,000 years old (and possibly a primary root for mankind's family tree). Their home, near Northern Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge, has been dubbed the ""Cradle of Mankind,"" partly because it has unearthed some of the oldest known human remains. An ancient way of life . Many of the Hadza live in a remote stretch of Tanzania, where much of their day is given over to foraging and hunting. The techniques they use for finding sustenance are passed down generation to generation. The men favor handmade bows and arrows, while the women dig up roots and gather berries. The Hadza don't store food, plant trees or build houses. Rather, they make temporary huts from dried grass and intertwined branches, and move in accordance with the local animals. ""We are rich in tradition,"" explains Shani Msafin-Sigwaze, the first Hadza to attend university, and an informal spokesperson for his community. ""Culture is very important, because when people forget their culture, they forget where they are from,"" he adds. Mounting challenges . Unfortunately, the Hadza way of life is under threat. In the last 50 years, they have lost 90% of their land to farmers and cattle herders, according to Survival International, an NGO in defense of tribal people around the world. ""Without the land, the Hadza will disappear,"" warns Msafin-Sigwaze. Furthermore, a lot of the big game animals and local plants that traditionally have made up the bulk of the Hadza diet are disappearing. ""There is a big problem with cows,"" admits Msafin-Sigwaze. ""The animals are scared of them and they run away. That's why the hunters have to [travel] far to even find little birds."" Meanwhile, much of the local forest and bush has been burned to make way for crops, or has been razed to produce water holes for irrigation. ""The Hadza are suffering much because the natural food is disappearing,"" explains Msafin-Sigwaze. Positive signs? Though the threat the Hadza face is real -- and extinction is far from a remote possibility -- there have been some successful efforts to restore some of what they've lost. In 2011, for instance, the Tanzanian government issued land titles to a community of Hadza living in Yaeda Chini. Now Msafin-Sigwaze, who belongs to a separate tribe of Hadza, is hoping he can achieve the same for his community. ""I belong to the Hadza. I study in the name of the Hadza. The name of the Hadza has made me go to university,"" he says. ""Now, I'm going to fight until I see the Hadza get their land.""",2,9.808249385574932

43ea34812d831353ab0dbc3fda3299b522bcd107,CNN,"(CNN) -- Union workers armed with an estimated 1.5 million signatures converged on Washington on Wednesday, demanding that Congress pass their highest-priority legislation. Union chief Andy Stern wants workers to have another way to organize besides relying on a secret ballot. They are lobbying for the Employee Free Choice Act. The legislation would allow a company's employees to openly sign a card demanding a union and then, if a majority sign, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate. The act would also stiffen federal laws that bar employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union. But while the battle is just beginning on Capitol Hill, business owners like Dave Bego have been in the center of the fight for some time. Bego, of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the owner of EMS, a company that provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire by one of the nation's most powerful labor organizations, the Service Employees International Union. The 1.8 million-member SEIU argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. But Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.  Watch how company, union are at odds » . He said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. He said his workers don't want a union, because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues. ""We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],"" Bego said. ""They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so."" But union workers CNN talked to said EMS employees are afraid to speak publicly because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. She said EMS fired her after she complained about what she said were unsafe conditions. ""We're not the only ones,"" Brown said. ""There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same similarities or different similarities, but they're going through things that are not right and not safe."" That's why she supports the Employee Free Choice Act, she said. ""When polls show that 60 percent of the workers in America want to organize, yet only 7 percent belong to unions, you know something's broken,"" one of the bill's sponsors, Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, told Wednesday's union rally in Washington. The option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the ""card check"" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join. ""Card check is real simple,"" Bego said. ""They want to eliminate the secret ballot election. And that is kind of like saying, 'We're going to elect the president of our country by signing cards. We're going to go door to door and you're going to sign a card for who you want to be president.' "" Bego said if his employees want a union, they should be able to secretly vote for one. He offered to hold union elections at his company, but only if they were monitored by the National Labor Relations Board and involved secret ballots. He said the union did not respond, but continued the protests. He took out an ad in the Indianapolis Star, challenging SEIU to ""fish or cut bait."" Andy Stern, president of the SEIU and a major supporter of President Barack Obama, said the legislation provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union. ""This isn't necessarily an election,"" Stern said. ""This is people wanting to start an organization."" ""This is workers' choice,"" Stern said. ""They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards."" Stern would appear to have the muscle to push the legislation through Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives. The union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election, and Stern said politicians who made the unions promises during the campaign now need to keep them. ""We can lobby, we can petition, we can use the same things we use in the electoral process to un-elect people,"" he said. Asked if elected officials should be afraid of him, Stern replied, ""Everyone should be scared"" of not living up to promises. CNN's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report.",5,5.985563366705936
4c75db7446764da831081a745eb130661da10d39,CNN,"(CNN) -- When you think back to your favorite TV memories, often music is intertwined. Whether it's the theme song from ""Gilligan's Island,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" ""Cheers"" or ""Batman,"" it's often the thing people remember more than anything else about a show. But were they ever on the same level with, say, the themes from ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather?"" Over the past decade, we've seen the rise of television as prestige entertainment. And we've had memorable theme music to go along with it, from ""The Sopranos"" to ""Dexter"" to ""Mad Men."" Two of the most noteworthy themes from the recent era, ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""The Walking Dead,"" come from the mind of young Emmy award-winning composer Bear McCreary, who has been in demand ever since ""Battlestar."" For example, he won that Emmy for the Starz TV series ""Da Vinci's Demons,"" and most recently, he's composed the theme for the high-profile network series ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" and the upcoming Starz series ""Black Sails."" McCreary recently spoke to CNN about what goes into TV music in the 21st century, and whether it now stands shoulder to shoulder with movie scoring. CNN: How did you first find yourself in this line of work? Bear McCreary: I've never wanted to do anything else for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I loved film and television and loved music. I was always keenly aware of music in film and television, more so than anyone else I knew. When I'd go see a movie, my friends would talk about the cool spaceships (and later, the hot chicks). But for me, I would talk about how Jerry Goldsmith used the French horns instead of the English horns to signify a different character, or what Danny Elfman or Elmer Bernstein was doing. These were my heroes growing up, so it never occurred to me to do anything else with my life. It was predestined almost. I'm very lucky that I got into it, because there's literally nothing else I would be interested in doing in my life. My first project was ""Battlestar Galactica,"" which put me on the map in a big way in science fiction. Even the horror and suspense genres, action shows -- I do a lot of work in that environment. When (creator) David Goyer called me about doing ""Da Vinci's Demons,"" it was the first time I was asked to do a historical period piece, so I leapt at the opportunity. One of the things that makes it different -- when you're doing regular TV, or science fiction especially, you can't really argue with how music sounds. You can do whatever you want. It doesn't mean it's always tasteful, but there's no right or wrong. I really wanted to embrace the restrictions of that time period -- Renaissance instrumentation, Renaissance melodies -- I really wanted to evoke that period. The problem was Goyer wanted to do the opposite of that. It was a very modern adventure show. What ended up happening is actually a hybrid of both ideas. We ended up with this unique hybrid. When you hear it, ends up sounding like the show -- it doesn't sound like anything else. CNN: At what point in the process of making a TV episode is the music composed? McCreary: I definitely know what's coming. I'm aware of where the stories are going. But ultimately that's to get some preliminary ideas in the back of my mind. I look at the finished video to figure out what it needs -- are there shortcomings? Are there storylines not quite being communicated? And that's when I sit with the showrunners and get from them what they want the audience to feel and what stories they want to track. Then I go back to my studio to add all that narrative connective tissue in a language that still stays true to the sound of the show. CNN: ""The Walking Dead"" has a memorably haunting theme. How did you approach making music for the apocalypse? McCreary: It's funny, I had dealt with the end of the world in ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Caprica,"" ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles."" Even with ""Eureka,"" I had done it. After a while, I had a feeling, wow, I'm the end of the world guy! With ""The Walking Dead,"" I wanted to focus on the opposite of that. I wanted to let the apocalyptic events unfold naturally. I try to focus on the actors' performance and try to support them. They're the ones who react -- they are us. When Rick crawls out of the hospital for the first time among all the bodies, the music -- given what he's seen and probably smelled at that time -- is pretty reserved. And that I think also heightens the tension. Horror is a particularly tricky genre for television. It's hard enough to scare an audience and keep them on the edge of their seat for two hours. You really have to pull out a lot of tricks to do that. We're on hour 50 of ""The Walking Dead"" and these producers are keeping people on their toes, and keeping things fresh and keeping it scary. So a subtle approach helps that, because when you have a really long duration story, you want to conserve your energy as much as possible. CNN: What is your favorite type of scene to score? Your most challenging scene? McCreary: It's very hard to say. I thrive on diversity. Action scenes are fun until you do a million of them. Emotional scenes are great until you get too many in a row. My favorite type of scene is one that has layers to it, narratively. I like scenes that when I look at them, it's not obvious what the music should be doing. Should it be scary? Should it be funny? What is the character thinking? If the slightest shift in the music will make you feel sympathy to one person over another, that's really fun and that puts the composer in a powerful position. There was a cue in ""The Walking Dead"" -- in the third season, the fourth episode, a major character died. I'm a bit of a method actor when I write, I can't write music for a scene without completely taking myself to this emotion and trying to channel my feelings into music. When people watched it, they were gutted and heartbroken when they saw this scene. I had to watch it probably 70 times. I would be weeping sometimes, my stomach hurt. I was truly miserable doing that scene. But the key turned out pretty good and moved people. Those sort of scenes are not fun to do. The process is not my idea of a good time, but the rewards are much higher. CNN: What are your favorite TV themes of all time? McCreary: The first TV theme that really popped up for me was ""The Simpsons."" Danny Elfman's interesting, harmonic take, using the tritone, which sounded a little weird. I remember picking that up on the piano and wondering why that note was weird. What stoked me as a kid was ""Mission: Impossible."" It is in 5/4. It is one of the handful of famous television theme songs that are not in 4/4 or 3/4. No one realized what they were hearing. It's very sophisticated scoring. CNN: Where do you think TV music is today? McCreary: (TV has) been a proving ground for actors, writers and directors. It's changing -- it's less the training ground to hone your skills and go onto movies. Now, you get good at your skill and you get onto really incredible television shows. The scores on TV are so satisfying. For me -- to take it back to ""Da Vinci"" -- it feels like a bit of a renaissance in the industry. CNN: I saw that they recently created an instrument based on Leonardo da Vinci's design -- a hybrid of a piano and cello. McCreary: I heard about the designs on the codex for this and planned to build this and do something with it for a future episode, having no idea this guy had built it. Of course I was thrilled when this went up on the social media radar. It just puts Leonardo as a pop culture figure in the mainstream -- though he never really left. The mechanics are different, like a rotating keyboard and the hurdy-gurdy engine. David Goyer and I are talking about it and we've got some ideas cooking.",4,11.02752694595142
06648ea6776f85b1838224bdf2333c9891daa9cb,CNN,"(CNN) -- A U.S.-run detention center housing 3,000 people will move to Afghan control under a crucial agreement signed Friday that smooths the way toward a larger agreement on the United States' future role in the country. The agreement, which calls for the gradual transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan over six months, removes one key sticking point from negotiations over a broader agreement on the role of the United States in Afghanistan after foreign combat troops withdraw in 2014. Negotiations over the wide-ranging strategic agreement have been going on for more than a year, with little progress. Tensions between the two countries, made worse by the February burning of Qurans by U.S. troops at Bagram Air Base, have complicated the talks. In November, a loya jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces after combat operations, but only if the countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, an end to night raids and eliminating immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes in Afghanistan. U.S. and Afghan officials have already begun talks on the other major issue gumming up the larger agreement: night raids by U.S. special operations forces, according to U.S. and Afghan officials who jointly briefed reporters. ""The signing of this memorandum is an important step forward in our Strategic Partnership negotiations and very much in keeping with both the Loya Jirga's recommendations and the desires of President (Hamid) Karzai,"" said U.S. Gen. John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force. Karzai has repeatedly called for the end of U.S. oversight of detention facilities in the country. On Friday, his spokesman, Aimal Faizi, called the agreement ""big progress."" ""Things are happening as we wanted,"" Faizi said. U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said the memorandum of understanding, or MOU, demonstrates the United States' commitment to Afghan sovereignty and its partnership with Afghanistan, despite ups and downs in the tense relationship between the two countries. ""We have had our challenges, and there will be challenges ahead as we continue negotiations on the framework for our strategic partnership, but this MOU marks an important step forward,"" he said. The agreement calls for the United States to transfer all of the approximately 3,000 Afghan citizens currently held under U.S. guard at the Parwan detention facility near Bagram Air Base to Afghan authorities within six months. The first 500 detainees would be transferred within 45 days, according to the agreement. Transferred detainees will eventually be moved to new facilities being built in Parwan and Pol-I-Charki, but until then will be moved from the U.S. side of Parwan to the Afghan side of the center. Although detainees would be held by Afghanistan, U.S. forces would remain at Parwan in a ""technical advisory and logistical support"" role, the officials who briefed reporters said. Afghan commanders also would not have the authority to release detainees on their own, according to agreement. Any request to release a prisoner would have to be agreed to by a joint committee headed by the ISAF commander and the Afghan defense minister, according to the agreement. The deal does not apply to about 50 non-Afghan prisoners being held at Parwan. Their fate was unclear. The officer currently responsible for prison protection, identified by Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zahir Azimi as Gen. Safiullah, will take over the Parwan facility, which is the successor to one demolished in 2009 after allegations of abuse. That facility, called the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, was the site of abusive interrogation that ended in the deaths of two detainees in 2002, according to Amnesty International, which has described abusive treatment of detainees at the facility as common. While the new center has not seen that level of scandal, Amnesty International and other groups have continued to challenge conditions of detention at the facility, including seeking access to U.S. courts for those held at Parwan. The group also complained in 2010 about allegations of abuse, including isolation, sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme temperatures, at a screening facility at Bagram Air Base. The Bagram base was also the site of the recent Quran burnings that set off a wave of protests and violence targeting NATO troops. The Muslim holy books had been seized from a detainee center and allegedly contained militant annotations. U.S. President Barack Obama apologized for the incident, saying it was inadvertent.",1,9.740449831130595
a5fbee063813156f859b7f58ebe0f72b67816be9,CNN,"(CNN) -- It doesn't appear tracking down this piece of 9/11 history will be easy. Tips have been rolling in, spurred by the CNN Films' production, ""The Flag,"" a documentary about the flag that three New York firefighters hoisted above the World Trade Center rubble in the aftermath of the attack. This particular version of Old Glory was 3 feet by 5 feet. Photos and video from the site suggest it went missing fewer than six hours after a photographer with a Bergen, New Jersey, newspaper captured the firefighters' deed in a photo that would become one of the most -- if not the most -- iconic images from tragedy. Co-director Michael Tucker said he expects that as news of the film infiltrates the tight-knit communities of New York's firefighters, police officers, port authority workers and paramedics, more viable leads will come. ""Once more people from that world see it, I think we're going to start learning a lot more,"" he said, adding that he and co-director Petra Epperlein examined more than 5,000 photos and viewed four days of television coverage from each of the networks during the documentary's production. Viewers began sharing leads before the documentary aired Wednesday, as TV featured promos and CNN.com posted a preview. By Wednesday night, there were a collective 50 tips to CNN.com's landing page, an e-mail tip line and Twitter. Only a dozen or so were credible. Of course, there was the obligatory yahoo claiming aliens took it -- but there were more sober sightings as well. A Florida woman said she saw it in the New York State Museum in Albany, while another viewer wondered whether a flag he'd seen at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point was the banner in question. Other potential sightings came at Missouri's Fort Leonard Wood; NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston; the Escondido, California, Elks Lodge; and the hair and makeup department of the New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In one seemingly angry e-mail received before the documentary aired, a man using the name of a retired New York police lieutenant slammed the firefighters. He accused them of stealing the flag (the documentary explains how it was taken from a yacht docked near the trade center) and claimed the iconic photo was staged and that the firefighters absconded with the flag after the picture was taken. ""There had already been a few flags hoisted down at the site including the first flag to be hoisted by 2 officers from the NYPD,"" the tipster wrote. ""Since the NYPD raised their flag in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there is still a ton of smoke and soot in the air, there are numerous rescue workers on scene ... several of whom are saluting. This is a much more original, natural, unrehearsed shot than the photo op taken much later."" The most credible tip, Tucker said, came from a man who said a lighting company in Oskaloosa, Iowa, that assisted with the 9/11 cleanup effort was in possession of the flag. But that flag turned out to be larger than the 9/11 flag, Tucker said. Tucker's hunch is that the flag's disappearance involved nothing nefarious. ""Someone most likely saw it there and thought that's a dirty, tattered flag and said, 'I'm going to save that,' "" he said. ""It's going to be someone who either went there to volunteer with some specific skill or was a first responder. ""If anything, I think someone's intentions were very good."" While some tips are more feasible than others, Tucker says, ""They're all legitimate because people have connections to these objects, to these symbols."" And perhaps more important than finding the flag is providing this outlet for catharsis, Tucker said. Many people have forgotten how they felt the day the towers came down. With a war-weary nation now considering military action in Syria, Tucker believes discussing and searching for the 9/11 flag gives people an opportunity to revisit their emotions and ""immerse themselves in the story of that day."" ""It was the worst of days that somehow brought out the best in many Americans,"" he said. ""It's more than looking for a flag. It's about looking for that feeling."" Help find the flag .",5,10.507509045829778
0cc7b2f94f5e1e81b6d885ccc48962d9d0b7dadc,CNN,"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as ""Training Day"" and ""Shooter,"" turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film ""From MLK to Today,"" which airs at 7 p.m. ET Monday. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua, 43, says he didn't believe he would see an African-American president in his lifetime. Before flying off to the Sundance Film Festival to premiere his latest action-thriller, ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle, Fuqua, 43, stopped by the CNN newsroom in Hollywood to discuss the making of this film. He outlined his vision for the piece, which chronicles America's civil rights journey from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Barack Obama. CNN: As a filmmaker, you work with people like Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. Why are you sitting here in our edit bay doing this project? Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story. And because it's CNN. It's important to be a part of history, and a part of inspiring people today. I think this is one of the biggest times in my life -- besides my children. So why wouldn't I be here? What else would I be doing except flying to Sundance to promote my movie! [Laughs]  Watch a clip from ""From MLK to Today"" » . CNN: You were born in the '60s, so you were very young during the civil rights movement. You were barely out of diapers when Martin Luther King was assassinated. Fuqua: I am familiar with the history because I love history. African-Americans -- I feel we cannot ever forget our past. Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do. I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know. CNN: What do you remember from your childhood? Fuqua: I remember being afraid at times. I remember the Black Panthers. When I was a little boy, the men that were around me were part of a movement. There was a lot of tension. There were a lot of weapons around. There was talk of FBI. I was a little kid, you know -- 6, 5 years old. I didn't really know what it meant. But there was a lot of fear -- a lot of fear of police, or of leaving your neighborhood. CNN: Did you experience much racism growing up in Pittsburgh? Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism. I mean, we used to get beat up by the police. We used to go to certain areas, and cops would slap you around, and grab you by your collar and treat you a certain way. I remember getting on a bus and drivers would treat us disrespectfully, assuming we were going to misbehave. And we were just going to school. I got into fights at school. ... No real reason, except for color of the skin. I don't think they even understood really. CNN: Did you understand? Fuqua: Not really. I didn't really understand it. I was used to it. I had an understanding of it at that age, which was I was black and they were white, and I was poor and they had money. CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black? What about being a director? Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."" Then I read something about craftsmanship -- which is not a word you used often in that time in the ghettos. If you learn a craft, then you can make a living for the rest of your life. So I went to school to be an electrical engineer. And when I was in school, I took a Baroque art class. They were talking about Caravaggio, who was a Baroque painter. Now he was from the streets in Italy, and he used to paint these very provocative paintings of people he lived with on the streets -- beggars, and prostitutes and things. It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall. Then I started to study [Akira] Kurosawa, who was a painter as well as a director. I saw his movies -- ""The Seven Samurai"" and all that -- and I thought, ""Wow, that's even more interesting, because it's a moving picture and you get to tell a story."" CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. Did you ever think you'd see an African-American president of the United States? Fuqua: Never. Never. Not in my time. I thought somewhere down the line it would happen, but not in my time -- because I still deal with racial situations. Sometimes people don't do it blatantly. They'll say something, or they'll behave a certain way when I know they don't normally behave that way. As a director, you run into walls where they say, ""Well, it doesn't translate well overseas. You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."" There's some truth to that. So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president? You know, the CEO of the country? And obviously, we are. We are ready. CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins. Would you have cast Barack Obama in that role? Fuqua: In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat. He's like a movie star. Look at the guy. He's dashing, he's charming, he's got a little swagger about him. He reminds me of Denzel in their way. [Fuqua directed Washington in the 2001 action-thriller ""Training Day.""] I was with Denzel over Christmas, and they're very similar -- their mannerisms at times. CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King. Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. I think Barack Obama is the ""dream."" I mean, we're all the dream. I think it's a bigger picture than one man. CNN: What's the message you want to convey with your short film? Fuqua: Hope. A sense of the past. But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.",3,6.345870134394099
c01ed40846cd927100fdb1ca1dcc2b6dc006f3e1,CNN,"(CNN) -- The search for two missing hikers on Oregon's Mount Hood has moved from a search operation into a recovery operation, authorities said Wednesday. ""It was our hope that we might get a window today to take a last look,"" Clackamas County, Oregon, Sheriff Craig Roberts told reporters. ""Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."" Anthony Vietti, 24; Luke Gullberg, 26; and Katie Nolan, 29, set out about 1 a.m. Friday on what was to have been a fairly easy ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain, Sheriff's Deputy Scott Meyers has said. Gullberg was found dead Saturday from hypothermia. Authorities said Tuesday they were suspending the search, citing the threat of avalanches. Roberts said Wednesday the mountain was experiencing 60 mph winds and the weather is not expected to clear anytime soon. However, the Sheriff's Office will continue to monitor weather conditions and will launch an organized recovery mission when conditions improve, he said. ""God has given me a peace about Katie,"" Nolan's father, David Nolan, told reporters Wednesday. ""He's given me strength."" ""I think there needs to be a time of meeting with my family, and we're going to talk, and we're going to cry, and we're going to hug one another, and then we're going to turn around and praise God that we know Katie is in heaven,"" he said. ""We are confident ... she has led a life that's been exemplary."" ""This has not shaken our faith,"" said John Vietti, Anthony Vietti's father. ""This has strengthened our faith."" On Tuesday, authorities said there was little hope the two would be found alive. ""Could they be alive? Yes,"" said Dr. Terri Schmidt, physician supervisor for American Medical Response in Clackamas County. ""Is it very likely? No."" A specialist in emergency medicine, Schmidt noted that ""at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent."" Operations coordinator Nate Thompson hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that Gullberg, the most experienced of the three, may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help. Above his body rescuers found a water bottle, a helmet, a harness, a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to Nolan. ""Maybe Katie lost a mitten in an accident,"" Thompson said. If Gullberg did indeed seek to return for help and Nolan lost one of her mittens in an accident, he may have left his gear, his pack and his supplies and gloves with her, taking the lone mitten, he said. But descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places. ""If there was some form of an accident and Luke did downclimb, this is a much more difficult descent,"" he said. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington.

53dab23859814c2c3c8a3e06492eaa2ea27f1f58,CNN,"(CNN) -- While he fell short of bluntly saying, ""I told you so,"" Alexei Miller, arguably Russia's most powerful energy executive, warned the West that it may not be able to count on Mideast and North African energy supplies as it once did. Coming from Miller, the chief of Russian energy giant Gazprom, it was a not-too-subtle nudge that global importers of energy, especially Europe, should invest more in Russian oil and gas capacity. ""The question about the reliability of gas deliveries from North Africa to Europe should be more critically examined than it is currently."" said Miller in comments to NTV, a Gazprom-owned Russian broadcaster. Gazprom told CNN its executives were not available to further clarify his comments. However, Gazprom has been one of many Russian energy companies trying to attract more foreign investment to further exploit its vast and proven oil and gas reserves. ""Perhaps Russia is trying to issue some friendly advice (to the West) that maybe it's time to diversify our sources of energy. It is good for Russia for it's certainly in a position to do more."" said Liam Halligan, chief economist of Prosperity Capital in London. According to U.S. government statistics, Russia is the world's largest oil producer and second-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. But the timely, if opportunistic, warning darkened an already jittery mood among energy analysts as some now discussed the possibility of an oil ""superspike"" that could fuel a commodities crisis in the months to come. How high could oil go? While industry insiders agree a spike of $200 a barrel is unlikely, many are now unwilling to rule out that kind of a price range. Oil cartel OPEC has tried to calm concerns, saying spare capacity exists to soften the blow and moderate price spikes. But some now doubt the organization has a handle on spare capacity. ""There is growing concern in the market that there isn't the spare capacity in Saudi Arabia that the markets have been told there is,"" said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. ""The second problem is that the markets can't be as relaxed about the Middle East and North African now as they were even a week or two ago,"" he said. ""What matters about Libya is that you've seen a regime which has been stable for the better part of 30 years and is in danger of being overthrown. The assumption that we can assume stability in, say Saudi Arabia, or other countries around the Gulf, that assumption is now going to be doubted by the markets,"" Robertson said.",7,13.480787691062089
737e469786667cb2a223df887f39e3f3718f88a2,CNN,"(CNN) -- If this yacht could talk, one can only imagine the stories it would tell about one of the most high-profile romances of the 20th century. The stately superyacht Christina O isn't just a gorgeous 99-meter vessel. It's the palatial setting where billionaire shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy, the former wife of U.S. President John F Kennedy. Now the luxury liner which played host to the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of 1950s high society -- including Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and John Wayne -- has gone on sale for a whopping $32 million. Known for its lavish parties, the elegant ship may well be called the ""Love Boat,"" for its notorious on board romances -- and even a royal wedding. In 1956 Prince Rainier of Monaco and U.S. screen siren Grace Kelly held their wedding reception on the boat, which accommodates 36 guests in 18 sumptuous staterooms. Onassis' own love affair with opera singer Maria Callas also played out on board, as they cruised exotic locations across Europe in the company of Hollywood stars Greta Garbo, Bette Davis and Margot Fonteyne. However, the affair ended abruptly when the tycoon courted President Kennedy's widow, Jackie, later marrying on the very same yacht in 1968, near his private island of Scorpios. ""Aristotle Onassis saw Christina O as a powerful symbol of his growing business empire,"" said Nicholas Edmiston, chairman of the yacht company Edmiston, which plans to sell the vessel mid-August. ""It really was the last word in opulence and many personalities were attracted by its ability to offer them some privacy, not just by its magnificence."" It's been quite a journey for the boat which began life in 1943 as a World War II surplus Canadian frigate. A decade later, Onassis bought the boat for just $34,000, gutting the interior and spending $4 million -- the equivalent of $45 million today -- converting her into one of the luxurious superyachts in the world. In 1975, Onassis died and the yacht was left to his daughter, Christina, in his will. She in turn bequeathed it to the Greek government as a presidential yacht. More than 20 years later, the tired-looking vessel was restored to its former glory, and now boasts an art deco dining room where Maria Callas and Frank Sinatra used to perform, an atrium with onyx pillars, and a mosaic pool which converts into a dance floor.",7,7.052239824689057

The picture doesn't tell the whole story. Larson, a CNN iReporter, said the resort had no record of the couple's reservation for the honeymoon suite, leaving them half-asleep in the lobby until the middle of the night. The private beach? Not so private, with wandering drug dealers who didn't take kindly to the U.S. Naval Academy graduate and his wife declining their products. ""The Antigua pics being quite different than the story was an accident,"" said Larson of Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I wish I had pics of the (possibly human) bone fragment (I found on the beach), the cop giving me a hard time when I reported it, the massive storm that flooded St. John's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought I'd been kidnapped for ransom, and on and on."" It might have been the vacation from hell, but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures. Inspired by the true stories behind picture-perfect photos, we asked CNN's iReporters to share their dream vacation photos and the real stories behind them. Almost everyone had amazing and sometimes horrifying stories that the camera didn't catch. 10 budget friendly all-inclusive resorts . They didn't let illness ruin their trip . Donna Henderson, another iReporter, had hoped for lovely times with her mother during a three-week vacation through Iceland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands and Italy. Her aunt joined them for part of the trip. It didn't go as planned. Less than a week after they arrived, her mother got a cough that turned into a viral chest infection. A few days later, her aunt had a heart attack. Henderson started to feel sick the next day and visited a hospital emergency room just to make sure she was OK. The special night out she planned for her mother's birthday, including a dinner cruise down the Seine River? They didn't make it. Despite their illnesses, Henderson doesn't dwell on the negative aspects of the trip when she looks through her pictures. ""One of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult,"" wrote Henderson, an Ottawa, Canada resident, in an e-mail. ""The trip to the Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon (in Iceland) was amazing and worth the entire 13.5 hours it took us, as we did it as a day trip,"" she wrote. ""My mum, who was born in Scotland, had always wanted to see Fingal's Cave and was finally able to do so. That was good for her to see it and for me to be the one to take her."" Five beautiful bike trips . Attack of the killer sand flies . Adam Parker, an iReporter from Decatur, Georgia, loves to take pictures and was immediately drawn toward Barbuda, ""a little jewel of an island where we could have some scenic solitude"" for his honeymoon. The happy couple knew that they wouldn't have air conditioning, which wouldn't have been a problem if sand fly season hadn't started earlier than usual. ""My wife would like me to clarify that we didn't just itch a little from bugs,"" he added. ""We actually spent most nights getting to sleep with her on the couch and me in the other room because we fell asleep whenever we became too exhausted to stay awake."" The highlight of the trip? Visiting the island's only hospital in search of relief from the itching. ""The hospital was an old, barely staffed facility in which half of the equipment used was outdated and/or rusted,"" he wrote. ""She chose to take antihistamine in pill form as opposed to getting a shot because we couldn't help but question the sterility of the environment."" He said, ""Now almost exactly a year later the memory of the biting pests has faded for me, not so much for my wife, and we are left with pictures that would make it hard to believe that we were treated to anything less than paradise during our first week of marriage."" Time doesn't blur the memories . While photos usually gloss over the back story, they're great for calling up those cherished, if not picture-perfect, family memories. Seattle iReporter Jim McClure and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children, now 24 and 28. Looking through pictures of the Canadian and Colorado Rockies, the Badlands, the Oregon and Washington coasts and the San Juan Islands sparked many memories not documented in the collection. McClure can clearly remember his daughter, ""at age 5 sitting, arms folded and crying because she was having difficulty setting up her tent, or the moose that wouldn't let me out of the campground shower building for several minutes."" ""My son and daughter set up and slept in their own tents, starting at a very young age. Everyone pitched in, from gathering fire wood to preparing meals to cleaning up. We were lucky to see and experience many wonderful things. We all remember our meals, some of the best food (ever) cooked over the fire."" The photo books were a hit with his kids during a recent family celebration. ""They were completely surprised,"" he wrote. ""The day's celebrations basically stopped while they slowly flipped through the books."" McClure said he's also grateful that his 90-year-old father is dedicated to reviewing and scanning his collection of photos that date back to McClure's great-grandparents' days. ""Every image tells a story, some short -- some longer,"" he wrote. ""It's not uncommon for an e-mail trail to go on for weeks, becoming pages long, containing the discussions these images conjure up from the recipients."" The pictures offer some perspective . iReporter Jim Heston was taking a day trip to Dala, across the Yangon River in Myanmar, when the skies decided to open up. As Heston ducked into a small shelter along the river to stay dry, children began to play in the rain, and an amazing photo opportunity presented itself. ""In the tropics, the people deal with the rain as a minor inconvenience, and don't let it hinder their mobility,"" he wrote. ""From the vantage point of the shelter, I was able to snap off pictures of people coming and going through the intersection."" He added, ""I made it to one more vantage point, an open restaurant near the ferry drop-off. This was a very vibrant spot as people arriving from the Yangon side, were on their way home. They weren't concerned about being drenched as they were getting close to home."" One man's washout is another's photo opp. And the rest of the world just goes about its business.

bc25f220c2a1dd20204fc74f20064f6e2402b8de,CNN,"(CNN) -- The blogging platform Tumblr -- which sits somewhere between Twitter and WordPress on the social media spectrum -- has become one of the more interesting places to watch the debate about the Occupy Wall Street protests unfold. On the Tumblr site ""We Are the 99 Percent,"" people who sympathize with the New York-based protest movement are telling first-person stories of hardship and unemployment. Each post features a photo of its author holding up a paper sign that tells a bit of the person's story and says ""We Are the 99 Percent,"" a reference to the protestors' concern that the top 1% of Americans command much of the country's wealth and power, leaving the rest to struggle. ""We are getting kicked out of our homes. We are forced to choose between groceries and rent. We are denied quality medical care. We are suffering from environmental pollution. We are working long hours for little pay and no rights, if we're working at all,"" a blog introduction says. ""We are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything. We are the 99 percent."" Here's one post from Tuesday: . ""My mom worked on Wall Street for almost 30 years. In 2008, when the market crashed, the company she worked for shut down. The CEOs were taken care of, but all the loyal workers were left with nothing. My mom still hasn't found work. I am the 99 percent."" And another: . ""I'm a small business owner. I just bought new work computers so my colleague and I can do our jobs. Now, I have no money for food for the next 3 days (next paycheck). I'm always one check away from eviction. I'm one of the 'lucky ones.'"" On Tuesday night there were 77 pages filled with similar stories, and about a half-dozen posts on each page. As attention for that Tumblr page grew, a competing blog with a more conservative ideology came into being. The conservative ""We are the 53%"" Tumblr page says it represents the 53% of Americans who must pay federal income tax (Most people who make less than $30,000 per year pay no major federal income taxes, according to a 2009 report from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, as CNNMoney reports). The assumption is that Occupy Wall Street protestors and sympathizers on the ""We Are the 99 Percent"" site don't pay taxes. ""I work 3 jobs. I have a house I can't sell. My family insurance costs are outrageous. But I don't blame Wall Street. Shut it up you whiners. I am the 53% subsidizing you so you can hang out on Wall Street and complain,"" the introductory post on October 5 says. The 53% blog was created by Erick Erickson, who also is an editor at the conservative site RedState.com, according to the Washington Post. (Erikson also is an occasional commentator for CNN). The conservative Tumblr blog has six pages of posts, compared to 77 on the site sympathizing with Occupy Wall Street. ""I would love to hang out in in (sic) the park for a couple of weeks protesting the entitlement generation and radical egalitarianism, but I have a job to go to. Go figure,"" another post says. Tumblr has become the site of choice for people organizing the Occupy Wall Street movement, which started in New York and has spread to many other cities in the United States, writes Jesse Emspak for DiscoveryNews. ""The site has been a force behind the Occupy Wall Street protests, growing the number of demonstrations from just dozens of people in late September to thousands,"" he says. At The Atlantic, Rebecca Rosen says the ""We Are the 99 Percent"" Tumblr page is the digital equivalent of bathroom stall graffiti -- ""allowing you to bear something private and maybe find someone else carrying around the same weight."" Along with the It Gets Better Project and PostSecret, the Tumblr account is part of an increasingly important medium called the ""collaborative confessional,"" she says. ""This is self-service history, with no curator and no narrator. Some of the stories call out for follow-up questions, but there is no one to ask them,"" Rosen writes. ""The results are raw and rough, but demonstrate that, with or without a Terkel, the power of personal narrative, whether on the radio, in a book, on YouTube, or on a Tumblr, can cut through the noise and cynicism of punditry and give shape and texture to our national story.""",0,11.652761684094358
0ee04e3dd910c9cce9fb8793435bece3ad9b62c5,CNN,"London (CNN) -- A breakthrough in graphene research which could pave the way for new smaller, faster, more powerful computer chips has be made by UK researchers. Scientists at the UK's University of Manchester say they have demonstrated how graphene -- a two-dimensional material made from a single layer of carbon atoms -- could look inside electronic circuits of the future. Graphene has been hailed as a ""miracle material"" which could revolutionize materials science because of its unique properties. Measuring one atom thick, it it the thinnest material on Earth -- a stack of three million sheets would rise to the grand height of one millimeter. Graphene is also the strongest (200 times stronger than steel), the most flexible and the most conductive material in the world -- which makes it an attractive alternative to the silicon chip. In their study, published in the journal Nature Physics, researchers report how they created a four-layered structure consisting of two sheets of graphene sandwiched between two sheets of boron nitride -- a similar two-dimensional material with a thin hexagonal-like structure. ""Creating the multilayer structure has allowed us to isolate graphene from negative influence of the environment and control graphene's electronic properties in a way it was impossible before,"" Leonid Ponomarenko, lead author of the study. This ""negative influence"" relates to graphene's ultra sensitivity to gases and humidity says Ponomarenko, which scientists at the university reported on back in 2007. ""To make its properties more controllable, we have to protect it with something,"" he said. The demonstration brings a replacement for the silicon chip one step closer, according to Ponomarenko. They are reaching their limit for being scaled down, he says, and as computers get more powerful silicon is struggling to meet the increasing energy demands. The discovery of graphene was made at the university in 2004 by Russian physicists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who received the Nobel prize for physics for their work in 2010. Commenting on the new research, Geim said: ""Graphene encapsulated within boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics. It solves nasty issues about graphene's stability and quality... ""It could be only a matter of several months before we have encapsulated graphene transistors with characteristics better than previously demonstrated,"" he added. Recent advances at Manchester and other UK universities has prompted the British government to invest Â£50 million ($78 million) in a research hub with the aim of maximizing the commercial potential of graphene. Its not just computer circuit boards that graphene promises to transform. The discovery that it is extremely sensitive to single molecules of gas could, according to Geim and Novoselov, lead to the development of new sensors, with possible applications in counter-terrorism. ""We are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene,"" Geim said. Countless universities around the world are also engaged in the same task. The U.S.'s Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, have recently discovered that graphene ""exhibits a novel reaction to light,"" which they say could improve night-vision systems and possibly provide a new approach to solar power. Excitement is building in the consumer electronics market too, as phone and computer manufacturers look to capitalize on graphene's uniqueness as a transparent conductor. ""The vision is to have electronic devices which can be integrated with your body or clothing, or computers which can be bent or rolled up and put away,"" said professor Andrea Ferrari, professor of nanotechnology at the UK's University of Cambridge. Researchers at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea have already demonstrated a flexible touchscreen, he says. And rumors were rife in cyberspace recently that South Korean electronics company, Samsung were going to release a flexible smartphone, called the ""Galaxy Skin"" in 2012. It turned out to be untrue, but bendable phones, computers and televisions may not be far off, says Ferrari. ""It may well be that in the next three or four years, if everything goes well, we may see some transparent and flexible devices made from graphene come to the market.""",6,8.791835264821424
8c8d04a5274fd92716fcf0926aea0c06e83e7987,CNN,"DONGSHIGU VILLAGE, China (CNN) -- As Christian Bale approached an impromptu checkpoint leading to this tiny village in eastern China, four men blocking the narrow path started marching toward him in menacing unison. ""I am here to see Chen Guangcheng,"" the ""Dark Knight"" actor said and I translated, with correspondent Stan Grant and cameraman Brad Olson next to us. ""Go away!"" the plainclothes guards barked, pushing us back. Amid the scuffling and yelling, dozens more guards in olive-green, military-style overcoats -- and two gray minivans -- emerged from the other side of the checkpoint, all coming toward us. ""Why can I not visit this free man?"" Bale asked repeatedly, only to receive punches from guards aiming for his small camera as they tried to drag him away from the rest of us. As we retreated, I recognized the ringleader -- the same burly man who had hurled rocks at the CNN team 10 months earlier to force us out of the same location. A precarious scene ensued Thursday as one of the gray minivans chased our car at high speed on bumpy country roads for some 40 minutes. When the dust settled, we counted a broken car, a damaged camera -- and a Hollywood star disappointed at -- but not shocked by -- his failure to see a personal hero. ""What I really wanted to do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what an inspiration he is,"" Bale said. The man, 40-year-old Chen Guangcheng, has been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter, and watched around the clock by dozens of guards since he was released from prison in September 2010. A local court had sentenced him to more than four years in prison for damaging property and disrupting traffic in a protest. Blind China activist recovers amid call for his release . His supporters maintain authorities used trumped-up charges to silence Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices by China's family-planning officials. Bale first learned about Chen through news reports, including our coverage in February, when he was in China filming ""The Flowers of War,"" a wartime drama set in 1930s Nanjing in which he plays a mortician trying to save a group of schoolgirls from the clutches invading Japanese soldiers. Blind lawyer makes Chinese officials jittery . The injustice faced by the activist and his family stirred such strong emotions in Bale that, upon hearing his impending return to China to promote the movie, he decided to do something unusual to raise the international awareness of Chen and thereby to turn up the heat on the Chinese government. ""This doesn't come naturally to me, this is not what I actually enjoy -- it isn't about me,"" he explained during our eight-hour drive from Beijing to the eastern city of Linyi, where Chen's village is located. ""But this was just a situation that said I can't look the other way."" Known to be a media-shy celebrity, Bale reached out to CNN and invited us to join him on his journey to visit Chen. In the car, he lamented the American public's lack of knowledge on Chen's case, despite senior U.S. officials' increasingly vocal support for his freedom. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gary Locke, the American ambassador to China, have both championed Chen's cause. Bale appeared a little surprised to learn that Relativity Media, which produced his 2010 Oscar-winning ""The Fighter"" and recently filmed a comedy in Linyi, was accused by activists of cozying up to the same officials who ordered Chen's detention and torture. The studio has issued a statement denying the allegation. Although China's state media has largely ignored the story, Chen's plight has spread online and outraged a growing number of Chinese ""netizens."" Many have tried to visit Chen, and activists say nearly all would-be visitors have been turned back, often violently, by plainclothes police and local thugs. ""I'm not brave doing this,"" Bale emphasized. ""The local people who are standing up to the authorities, who are visiting Chen and his family and getting beaten or detained, I want to support them."" As our car sped toward Beijing in the dark, Bale wondered aloud if he would never be allowed back -- a prospect he is prepared to accept -- even as ""The Flowers of War"" became China's official entry into next year's Academy Awards. ""Really, what else can I do to help Chen?"" he kept asking as the clock struck midnight, with his latest movie -- partially funded by the state -- about to open nationwide in China.",7,9.40016630551025
13c2cd1ad338bfb28c6a243e497d3ed2494ae44c,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Human error and system lapses, rather than deliberate concealing of information, allowed a terror suspect with explosives to board a U.S.-bound airplane on Christmas Day, President Obama's terrorism czar said Sunday. John Brennan, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the security breakdown in the failed bombing of the Northwest Airlines flight was different from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""It's not like 9/11,"" Brennan said, adding that the ""system didn't work as it should have"" due to ""lapses"" and ""human error."" ""There wasn't an effort to try to conceal information,"" he said, referring to the well-chronicled competition and turf wars among security agencies prior to the 2001 attacks, which was later blamed for the failure to prevent them. ""There is no smoking gun piece of intelligence out there,"" Brennan said of the failed Christmas bombing, allegedly planned by a Nigerian man who boarded the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, with explosives in his underwear. Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration announced Sunday new security measures to be implemented by domestic and international air carriers on flights bound for the United States, effective Monday. The suspect's father, a leading banker in Nigeria, warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists. Brennan said the father's information was part of ""bits and pieces"" of information that were never connected by intelligence officials to properly target the suspect. ""That was certainly an alert that came to our attention,"" Brennan said of the father's warnings. ""He said, 'He's consorting with extremists in Yemen.'"" However, Brennan rejected another potential warning sign -- that the suspect purchased the airline ticket with cash in Ghana before traveling to Nigeria for the first leg of his journey. ""A lot of people buy their tickets in Africa with cash. That is the way, in fact, things are done, because there's so much fraud there. So that wasn't a necessary [warning] bell,"" Brennan said. ""People in the Amsterdam airport didn't even know that he had bought the ticket for cash. He did bring on carry-on luggage. So there were a lot of things that were out there."" At the same time, Brennan conceded ""there was information that was in the system that should have allowed us to stop it."" ""A number of pieces were out there that weren't brought together,"" Brennan said. On the same program, however, the Republican chairman of the 9/11 commission said Brennan was ""wrong when he says this wasn't like 9/11."" Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey, said both events occurred because the U.S. intelligence community failed to piece together various bits of information it already possessed in the weeks and months prior to the attacks. If the information had been properly shared and analyzed, ""then this guy would've never have gotten on a plane"" on Christmas Day, Kean said. In announcing the new security measures Sunday, the TSA stressed in a statement that ""effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders."" As a result, any individual flying into the United States who is ""traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening,"" the statement said. ""The directive also increases the use of enhanced screening technologies and mandates threat-based and random screening for passengers on U.S. bound international flights.""",3,5.813212471007552

The U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force arrested Aaron Thomas, 39, without incident at his home in New Haven, according to a press release from that city's police department. There was no indication that he had been charged, though the statement did say he ""has been identified as the East Coast Rapist."" Early this week, six local law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the Department of Justice launched a joint website -- using the domain EastCoastRapist.com -- to solicit information from the public about a man they called a ""brazen, cold-blooded rapist.""

It has police sketches of the suspect, from the various locales. First Sgt. Kim Chinn, a spokeswoman for the Prince William County Police Department, told CNN affiliate WJLA that collective work of a recently formed multi-agency task force and ""an anonymous tip in the past few days"" helped spur the investigation this week.

d9c3c03d290d1c67681521d911729f13b50b6db8,CNN,"(CNN) -- On Sunday, Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII were canonized as saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This event clearly has intense significance for Catholics, but what about everyone else? Why should non-Catholics even care? Both men are widely popular among the laity, and the ceremony drew an enormous crowd. Both men also have critics. Some conservative Catholics still work to roll back the reforms of the Second Vatican Council called forth by John XXIII. Many Catholics strongly critique John Paul II's centralizing tendencies and catastrophic response to all the sex abuse scandals. For Catholics, however, saints don't have to be perfect. In fact, Catholics are inspired by the ability of saints to do good despite their human flaws. The process of canonization concentrates devotion on the best features of a historical person. In 1903, long before John XXIII was elected Pope, he wrote about each saint being ""holy in a different way."" These differences enhance, rather than detract, the importance of saints. So what might non-Catholics take away from this? First, both saints offer a model of risk-taking based on a strong sense of moral purpose. Second, one could learn a lot about what's going on with the billion or so Catholics in the world today. The dual canonizations, it turns out, symbolize an attempt to turn the church away from decades of infighting and turf wars and toward a mission for the common good. David O'Hara, associate professor of philosophy of religion at Augustana College, said, ""It should matter to us when our neighbors announce that they have designated new moral exemplars."" If our neighbors tell us a new story about their ideals, heroes and models for their own lives, then ""we have an interest in watching and even in helping our neighbors to tell that story in a way that is beneficial."" Beneficial -- but how? Claire Noonan, vice president for Mission and Ministry at Dominican University in Illinois, suggested that we all might be inspired by their risk-taking. Both men, she said, ""moved through the world discerning where, when and how to act without fear. The possibilities of their lives were not constricted by desires for wealth, power or honor. That freedom makes way for the pursuit of truth, justice and love."" Noonan cites John Paul II's work against communist oppression in Poland and John XXIII's efforts to ""free the entire church from the fear of modernism."" Nonbelievers can, if they choose, admire these examples of courage and action without believing that the two men have a special status in heaven or endorsing everything that they did. In that framework, the process of canonization crystallizes the memory of the two popes around their best deeds. The canonizations, though, do more than provide strong examples of moral courage. They reveal something very important about the aspirations of Pope Francis for the role of the Catholic Church in the world. According to Catholic belief, popes do not make people into saints; God does. Canonization, an all-too human practice, is the process of recognizing divinely given sanctity. As John Allen Jr. has written, ideally this is a deeply democratic process, with devotion to a holy person flowing upward from the laity to the hierarchy. Canonization provides an opportunity to shape memory. People become recognized as saints, in part, through storytelling, a topic I study as an historian of the Middle Ages. When we choose what stories to tell about a person, we reveal a lot about ourselves, our hopes and fears, the ways in which we might try to do better personally, and the kinds of changes we'd like to see in the world. That's been true since the early centuries of Christianity, a period in which sainthood was generally bestowed by local and regional communities without any broader oversight from church authorities. If a group of people believed that someone was a saint, and they set up shrines, venerated relics, developed rituals and told stories about miracles -- then that person was a saint. During the Middle Ages, the papacy asserted ever-increasing control over the process of who got to tell the stories of saints. While the vox populi still matters, next Sunday is Pope Francis' show. The symbolism of the twin canonizations is so powerful, in fact, that the editorial board of the New Catholic Reporter reacted to the announcement last July by declaring that truly ""the pontificate of Francis has begun."" Robert Ellsberg, author of several popular books about saints, suggested that by linking the canonizations, Francis is trying to start a new narrative. Ellsberg said, ""The internal Catholic cultural wars and polarization have increasingly embittered a lot of the internal life of the church. Overcoming some of those divisions and synthesizing some of the best and noblest features of these two popes by joining them, is a hopeful sign for anyone who is concerned about the future of humanity."" If the canonizations of Popes John XXIII and John Paul II can inspire more of us, as individuals, to find a moral purpose and take risks, our lives will be better for it. If the canonizations can help lead the Catholic Church away from bitter division and toward taking powerful moral positions on the world stage, especially following Francis' focus on poverty and inequality, we'll all be better for it.",0,10.085462695809683
d7c17d8cc84c70576d6143f22b918887087e3fa7,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday he told government lawyers to object to a court-ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees because the release could affect the safety of U.S. troops and ""inflame anti-American opinion."" President Obama discusses the alleged prisoner abuse photos at the White House on Wednesday. Releasing the photos could have a ""chilling effect"" on further investigations of detainee abuse without adding to the understanding of past abuses, he said. The Pentagon was set to release hundreds of photographs of prisoners in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The photos ""are not particularly sensational, especially when compared with the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib,"" Obama said, referring to the Iraqi military prison where photographs released in 2004 of detainees being abused and humiliated sparked widespread outrage. ""But they do represent conduct that didn't conform with the Army manual."" Obama reiterated that any future abuse of detainees is ""unacceptable"" and ""will not be tolerated."" The publication of the photos would not add any additional benefit to investigations being carried out into detainee abuse -- and could put future inquires at risk.  Watch the president discuss his detainee photo decision » . ""The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals,"" Obama said. ""In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger."" The announcement Wednesday was a reversal of what White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said last month, when he told reporters the White House had no problem releasing the photos. Before Obama spoke to reporters, Gibbs said Wednesday afternoon that there was ""a lot of back and forth in [Obama's] mind over the course of several weeks about ensuring that this protected those that keep us safe, that it protected our national security."" iReport.com: Should photos be released? The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. It followed Obama's decision to release Bush-era CIA documents showing the United States used techniques like waterboarding, considered torture by the current administration.  Waterboarding 'a mistake' » . Obama's decision ""makes a mockery"" of his promise of greater transparency and accountability, ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said. ""Essentially, by withholding these photographs from public view, the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration's torture policies,"" Singh said. ""The release of these photos is absolutely essential for ensuring that justice [is] done, for ensuring that the public [can] hold its government accountable, and for ensuring that torture is not conducted in the future in the name of the American people."" Singh said his organization is prepared to ""do whatever it takes"" to have the photos released. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that grave concerns coming from top military brass may have influenced the president's decision. ""What's motivated my own change of heart on this and perhaps influenced the president is that our commanders ... have expressed very serious reservations about this ... and that the release of these photographs will cost American lives,"" Gates said. ""That's all it took for me,"" he added. Democrats in the Senate were mostly quiet on Obama's reversal on Wednesday. But Sen. Russ Feingold, of Wisconsin, said he at least initially disagrees with it. ""I am generally opposed to keeping the American people in the dark for no other reason than to shield misconduct, avoid embarrassment or other reasons not pertaining to national security,"" Feingold said in a written statement. ""From what I've heard so far, I'm not convinced there is a compelling reason these photos shouldn't be released."" Two Democratic congressmen had different reactions to Obama's decision. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York said he thinks ""the administration may be very well justified in withholding the pictures."" Nadler, who said he agrees with the ACLU ""98 percent of the time -- but not here,"" said he had not seen the photos but he doubted they provided any more information than was in Bush-era memos recently released. ""Get all the memos out, get everything out ... but with these pictures it may be that they're dangerous, and that's a legitimate concern,"" he said. But Rep Lynn Woolsey of California said, ""I would have preferred that they were out there."" ""We have so much to do. It's such a distraction,"" Woolsey added. ""Get these pictures out there and get it behind us."" The ACLU said the Pentagon had agreed to release a ""substantial"" number of photographs by May 28. Officials at the Pentagon said the photographs are from more than 60 criminal investigations between 2001 and 2006 and show military personnel allegedly abusing detainees. ""The disclosure of these photographs serves as a further reminder that abuse of prisoners in U.S.-administered detention centers was systemic,"" ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said before Obama's decision. ""Some of the abuse occurred because senior civilian and military officials created a culture of impunity in which abuse was tolerated, and some of the abuse was expressly authorized."" Singh added that the photographs ""provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread, reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib."" But Pentagon officials reject ACLU allegations that the photos show a systemic pattern of abuse by the military. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Defense Department has ""always been serious about investigating credible allegations of abuse."" ""The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat all prisoners humanely, and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined,"" he added. More than 400 people, Whitman said, have been disciplined based on investigations involving alleged detainee abuse. The discipline ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand. The Pentagon initially wanted to prevent the images from being made public, but decided to release them after losing two court cases, according to Whitman. ""We felt this case had pretty much run its course,"" he said prior to Obama's decision. ""Legal options at this point had become pretty limited.""

9bf176d529490e3b8e5d3520d38e2b8a76c12f2e,CNN,"(CNN) -- It is widely recognized that the signing of the Armistice in 1918 did not put an end to the drama that began in 1914. Traditional geopolitical rivalries continued but now overlapped with competing ideologies of fascism and Stalinism to foster a climate of permanent war. That is why many observers at the time described the period 1914-1945 as a modern version of the Thirty Years War. Yet this second Thirty Years War soon gave way to the four decades-long Cold War. For a very brief moment the demise of the Cold War appeared to bring to an end the conflicts unleashed on the battlefields in 1914. But this ""End of History"" moment was brief. Today we are in the midst of a conflict originally designated as a ""War on Terror"" but which has been rebranded by the American government as the ""Long War"" and more recently as ""Overseas Contingency Operation."" The conflicts unleashed in 1914 were not confined to the military sphere. They were also a battle of ideas and a clash of cultures. The story that began in 1914 was influenced by a crisis of meaning that afflicted the political and cultural elites of western societies. A powerful mood of estrangement and disorientation dominated cultural life. In this moment of confusion even artists and intellectual sought meaning through fighting for a cause -- even a military one. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the war were motivated by a disposition to react against what they took to be the soulless world of capitalist modernity. Stefan Zweig, the renowned Austrian novelist, playwright and well-known pacifist lived to see two world wars. When the Great War broke out in 1914, he along with almost all European intellectuals, supported his nation's war effort. Later, with a hint of embarrassment he recalled the sense of excitement and celebration that the news of the impending conflict provoked among people. ""And to be truthful, I must acknowledge that there was a majestic, rapturous, and even seductive something in this first outbreak of the people from which one could escape only with difficulty,"" he recalled. World War I would be the last time that a significant body of intellectuals and artists would seek existential meaning on the battlefield. But conflicts over norms and values, which were crystallized through their quest for meaning continues to this day. Indeed on hindsight it is evident that the Great War was a catalyst for eroding the prevailing system of meaning and helped intensify a clash of values. That is why the origins of what is currently described as the Culture Wars can be situated at some time around August 1914. Culture became politicized and geopolitical ambitions were framed through appeals to a ""way of life."" Today, very few respectable intellectuals would be caught waving the flag. Instead of the flag, competing groups flaunt their identity and instead of celebrating their way of life they acclaim their lifestyle. With the demise of old ideologies the politicization of culture has acquired an increasingly unrestrained character. It is worth noting that most of the high-profile divisive issues -- family life, gay marriage, abortion, assisted suicide, multiculturalism -- express conflicts over cultural values. These symbolic struggles over the constitution of legitimate lifestyles continually exacerbate the fragmentation of social life. What's more disturbing is that such struggles increasingly extend into global affairs. The current conflict between Russia and its Western opponents is almost entirely conducted through the medium of culture. The denunciation of Putin as an authoritarian homophobe is self-consciously countered by the claim that Russia stands firm as the bastion of traditional values. Like Putin, many Muslims also take their stand on hallow grounds of tradition. Young Western Muslims self-consciously reject the values of the communities where they grew up and embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures. Jihadist videos often communicate a simple message -- which is that the Jihad provides quest for meaning. As I write, the war drums are again beating. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, has declared the establishment of a new caliphate in the Middle East. His object is to abolish one legacy of World War I, the border between Syria and Iraq. There is still no end in sight to the Great War.",4,10.505297337550012
1617ec144c5cac7a67eda17d4795e235630ebcf6,CNN,"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling is ""moving quickly"" to sell the embattled NBA franchise, with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week. The recent activity includes talks with several high-profile potential suitors for the team, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is ""very much involved"" in Shelly Sterling's dealings with potential buyers, according to the source. But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document provided by Donald Sterling's attorney. The document, Sterling's 26-page response to charges of violating the league's bylaws, adhered to the NBA's Tuesday deadline for the billionaire businessman's reply. The NBA has said the next step will be a special Board of Governors meeting on June 3, when the league's 30 ownership groups -- someone else will represent the Clippers -- will meet to hear evidence on Donald Sterling's behavior, then vote on terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights. Sterling has been prejudged and won't get a fair hearing, the document says, citing comments from 10 other teams. About one month ago, Silver banned Sterling from NBA facilities and functions and ordered him to pay a record fine after racist remarks by the Clippers' owner to former companion V. Stiviano surfaced online. A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA. The document says Sterling faces a never-before-issued and unjust punishment. ""In reality, Mr. Sterling is being banned for life, fined $2.5 million, and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day,"" the document says. Other NBA figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and weren't punished as harshly, Sterling argues. His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says. And while Sterling's remarks were viewed as racist, he says in his response that he was ""instrumental in fostering the diverse body of players, coaches, general managers, employees and fans on which the NBA prides itself."" The document also says Sterling was active in the African-American community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the Clippers in more than 30 years. Sterling asks that the NBA's charges be denied and that his ownership rights not be terminated. The NBA acknowledged receiving a response from Sterling and reaffirmed the June 3 meeting, saying it will start at 1 p.m. ET to ""hear and vote upon this matter."" Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, had no comment. Stiviano has said Sterling knew she was recording him and that the two were never intimate. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it appeared the Sterlings were taking a two-track strategy. By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but, at the same time, he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome. ""I don't think it's a winning argument, but it is a very impressive document,"" Toobin said. Possible bidders . CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling. The source indicated she met Sunday with a group led by former NBA star Grant Hill to discuss the sale of the Clippers. In addition, the source familiar with the situation said she met over the weekend at her Malibu, California, home with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who made an aggressive offer for the franchise. Shelly Sterling is interested in fielding offers from billionaire businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong, Hill's group, entertainment mogul David Geffen and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and entrepreneur Magic Johnson and his Guggenheim partners, who two years ago teamed up to buy baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. Johnson has been at the center of the story from the outset because of controversial banter between 80-year-old Donald Sterling and Stiviano. After TMZ first reported those comments, Donald Sterling lashed out at Johnson in a CNN interview, questioning whether someone who contracted HIV should be considered a role model and asking rhetorically ""what has he done"" for the African-American community. Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team. The former Los Angeles Laker said if that happens -- and if his Guggenheim partners are interested -- ""We'll make a run for it."" One person who apparently won't be the NBA franchise's next owner is media tycoon Oprah Winfrey. Despite much buzz in recent weeks, the source familiar with the situation says that Winfrey is ""out of the running."" The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers. Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said no formal offers have been made for the team, which has risen in recent years from a last-place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward Blake Griffin and guard Chris Paul. ""Shelly and the NBA are working cooperatively on the transaction,"" O'Donnell said. The Sterlings have been publicly defiant since the story broke, challenging the NBA and its right to force the Clippers' sale. But late last week, the Sterlings agreed that Shelly would try to sell the NBA franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights. The couple own the team through a trust. Shelly Sterling previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise, but doesn't want to be a controlling partner. But if it sold -- likely for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to the well-placed source -- the NBA doesn't want either Sterling to have any ownership stake. Still, they could take solace in the dizzying profit they'd make from such a deal; Donald Sterling reportedly bought the franchise in 1981 for about $12 million. His response, though, laments that a forced sale would mean the Sterlings would incur ""several hundred million dollars"" in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs.

ed610ddcac3319508ad9d6a7274351660299d400,CNN,"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart stormed out of the courtroom Wednesday during the trial of Brian Mitchell, charged with kidnapping the Utah teenager in 2002, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. Visibly upset, she left the courtroom during the testimony of a defense witness, Dr. Paul Whitehead, a forensic psychiatrist at the state mental hospital who treated Mitchell from 2005 to 2008. Whitehead testified about Mitchell's desire to bear children with Smart, KSTU reported. ""Mr. Mitchell was talking with Ms. Smart about having babies to the point where Ms. Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened,"" Whitehead testified. That statement prompted Smart's departure. She was followed by her mother. Mitchell's federal trial had been halted a day earlier when Mitchell suffered a medical problem in court. On Tuesday, KSTU posted a picture of Mitchell on its website, showing him wearing an oxygen mask and sitting on a stretcher as he was being loaded into an ambulance. Mitchell, as usual, had begun singing when he was led into the courtroom Tuesday: ""O Holy Night,"" KSTU reported. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball began the proceedings by raising an issue in a note sent from jurors. As Kimball asked for jurors to be brought in, Mitchell began to wail and dropped to the floor, KSTU said. Defense attorney Wendy Lewis told Kimball, ""He's having a seizure, your honor."" An ambulance was called, and paramedics came into the courthouse to examine Mitchell, according to KSTU. ""The judge told the jury that an issue had come up and the trial would be suspended,"" said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Rebecca Woodridge, Mitchell's stepdaughter, told KSTU he has suffered seizures before. ""He's had a few of them in the past year. I don't think there's any reason for him to fake this,"" she said. Defense attorney Robert Steele said outside the courthouse that Smart herself had testified about Mitchell suffering a seizure during her time in captivity. ""We watched a seizure,"" he said, according to KSTU. ""It really happened."" Mitchell, 57, faces charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor across state lines in Smart's abduction. Then 14, she was kidnapped from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home. Nine months later, she was found in the company of Mitchell -- a drifter and self-described ""prophet"" who called himself Immanuel -- and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Mitchell's trial resumed Monday after taking last week off. Barzee earlier testified as a defense witness. Defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for Mitchell, hoping to prove that mental illness clouded his mind to such a degree that he did not understand that his actions were wrong when he abducted and held Smart. The defense said Tuesday in court that they plan to conclude their case late this week, perhaps Thursday. The prosecution said it has up to five days of rebuttal witnesses, but both sides assured Kimball that they would be finished with closing arguments by December 10.

bcb2b6861367d368fdf228d82a7b24f100867e32,CNN,"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has approved legislation that could end the exemption ultra-Orthodox Jews get on military service. The bill now goes to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, for consideration, the prime minister's office said Sunday. ""We will enact this change gradually while considering the special needs of the ultra-Orthodox population,"" Netanyahu said. ""Our objective is two-fold: integrating young ultra-Orthodox into IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and national service and, no less important, integrating them into the labor force."" The bill would require the enlistment of the ultra-religious Haredim in the army. All other Jews in Israel are required to serve. The Haredim, who make up about 10% of the country according to government figures, are the fastest-growing segment of the population and constitute a powerful voting bloc. They have used political clout to maintain government subsidies for working-age men to study the Torah full time and protect the ability for ultra-Orthodox Israelis to win easy exemptions from compulsory military service. But the latest ruling government coalition formed this year excludes ultra-religious parties, almost always part of such coalitions in Israel. The exclusion comes amid a growing sense of resentment and anger among other Israelis over the exemptions. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.",3,9.558748507911316
c1d31c7fc912353c2057439396222f0c517160de,CNN,"(CNN) -- Few things enrage normally calm people like finding a parking ticket tucked under the windshield wiper of their car. Parking tickets can be infuriating, especially when they seem undeserved. (Officer, there's no sign saying I can't park here!). But most people don't want to invest the time and energy to would take to dispute them. Now there's a new iPhone app, Fixed, that will fight parking tickets for you. The app, expected to launch next week, will do the heavy lifting of contesting a ticket: suggesting reasons it might be invalid, gathering supporting evidence and submitting the proper appeals paperwork. If the driver beats the ticket, they pay Fixed 25% of what the citation would have cost. If they can't get out of the ticket, Fixed doesn't charge them anything. In this way, Fixed hopes to add navigating bureaucracy to the list of urban tasks and nuisances -- catching a cab, ordering food, finding a place to crash -- made easier by popular tech startups. ""When you mention parking tickets to people it engenders such an emotional reaction ... because so many people think they've received an unfair parking ticket,"" said Fixed co-founder David Hegarty, who came up with the idea after getting six parking tickets in one day. Much of this anger is directed at local governments, which many people see as using parking tickets to fill budget gaps. That emotional response, as well as a desire to not shell out $100 for blocking a couple inches of someone's driveway, could make Fixed a hit. But its success will depend on how good the service is at navigating parking laws, which are often a confusing hodgepodge of local and state ordinances. Here's how Fixed works: When someone gets a ticket, they snap a photo of it on their iPhone and enter the violation code. The Fixed app will tell them what percentage of those types of tickets are usually overturned and then show a list of possible reasons it could be found invalid. For example, a street cleaning sign might be obscured by a leafy tree, or a parking meter could be broken. If the motorist thinks they have a case, the app will prompt them to capture any additional photographic evidence with their phone and then digitally sign a letter. Fixed has contracted with a team of legal researchers fluent in local traffic laws who will review each case before printing out the letter and submitting it via snail mail to the city. Over time, Fixed hopes to learn more about what methods and which errors have the highest success rates when contesting tickets. That information will be used to make the system more automated. ""It will always be reviewed by human eyes before it's sent, but I'm pretty confident that we can get to the point where 80% of tickets are 95% automated,"" said Hegarty. Fixed is expected to launch in the Apple App store next week, although its service will only be available in San Francisco at first. The startup has been testing its service with a small group of 1,000 people, mostly friends and friends of friends, and there's already a waiting list of 25,000 people wanting to sign up. Hegarty and with Fixed's other two co-founders, David Sanghera and DJ Burdick, hope to expand into the top 100 U.S. cities over the next 18 months. San Francisco is fertile ground for motorists who can effortlessly rack up hundreds of dollars in parking tickets. As in many cities, parking in San Francisco is an exercise in frustration, with a limited number of spaces on the street and parking garages charging top dollar. The company hasn't had any official talks with the city. But Hegarty hopes his service is not seen as adversarial. Rather, he thinks Fixed could help people pay their legitimate parking tickets in a more timely manner. ""We do not have concerns if people want to use a third-party service, but there is no secret to overturning a citation if it has been issued erroneously. If someone feels that their citation was written in error, they might want to consider protesting themselves, for free,"" said Paul Rose, a spokesperson for San Francisco's transportation agency. San Francisco issues about 1.5 million parking tickets every year, typically for $45 to $115 each (there are also some significantly pricier violations, such as having an expired plate or abandoning a car on a highway). The fines add up to about $95 million a year, according to Hegarty. Of those 1.5 million citations, only five percent are actually contested. And of that small amount, only 30% are actually overturned, according to Rose. There are three rounds of appeals -- two by mail and a court hearing. Fixed will only handle the first two appeals for the time being. The number of overall citations in San Francisco has fallen in recent years as the city has rolled out its own technological tools, such as pay-by-phone and meters that take credit cards, in an effort to make payment easier. ""We'd much rather have people pay the meter than pay a fine,"" said Rose. Fixed's business model isn't completely new. There are companies that handle driving and parking violations for large corporations such as FedEx and UPS. In New York City, commercial delivery companies account for 20% to 30% of the city's 10 million parking tickets every year, according to Crain's New York Business. The difference is that Fixed is making this service available to individuals. Hegarty can see eventually expanding into speeding tickets and other small financial annoyances, such as cable company fees. He thinks Fixed could help in any area where the fee amount is small enough not to protest in person, but still big enough to make someone angry. ""That's our sweet spot,"" he said.",2,10.233503094193951
f85811ced5542f0335209ab7592f2ca7cb36c74d,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In 2004, even after being captured by U.S. forces, Saddam Hussein told an FBI interrogator he believed Iran was a greater threat to Iraq than the United States, according to newly released FBI documents. Baghdad's Al Mutamar newspaper shows Saddam Hussein, right, with Ahmed Chalabi of Iraq's governing council in 2003. The FBI interviews took place while Hussein, then identified by the FBI as ""High Value Detainee 1"" was held captive by U.S. military forces at Baghdad International Airport between February and June of 2004. Hussein regarded the Iranian threat as so serious that it was the major factor in his decision not to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return, he said. Citing their shared border and his belief Iran would intend to annex southern Iraq, Hussein said he was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses than repercussions from the United States and the international community. He believed that the inspectors would have directly identified to the Iranians where to inflict maximum damage to Iraq. Approximately 100 pages of declassified interview summaries, previously classified as secret, were obtained by the National Security Archive at the George Washington University through a Freedom of Information Act request. The FBI declined CNN's request to interview special agent George L. Piro, the agent who interviewed Hussein. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the declassified documents. ""As a general rule, the FBI does not discuss FOIA'd documents. We let the information stand on its own,"" Bresson told CNN. Piro, an FBI agent fluent in Arabic, conducted the interviews along with another agent whose name has been redacted from the documents. Although Hussein had been a prisoner for months, at one point during an interview he said, ""I am not the ex-president of Iraq. I am still the president of Iraq."" Hussein also described al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a ""zealot"" and said he had never met or seen him. He also said the United States used the September 11 attacks as justification to attack Iraq, and that the United States had ""lost sight of the cause.""  Despite Piro citing evidence of Iraq's contacts with al Qaeda, Hussein said, ""The Iraqi government did not cooperate with bin Laden"" and that the two ""did not have the same belief or vision."" The former regime's alleged weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to al Qaeda were the Bush administration's primary justifications for invading Iraq in March of 2003. Piro and Hussein spoke extensively about Iraq's chemical weapons during the Iran war, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and in the years before the second U.S. invasion. Hussein refused to answer a question about whether Iraq would have lost the war it fought with Iran from 1980 to 1988 if it had not used chemical weapons. He also said neither he nor any other Iraqi officials discussed using chemical weapons during the first Gulf War. Hussein admitted that Iraq made a mistake by destroying some weapons without U.N. supervision. In his view, the inspectors wanted all of their expenses paid for by Iraq. Instead of waiting for the inspectors and paying the expenses, Iraq began destroying the weapons. ""We destroyed them. We told you, with documents. That's it,"" Hussein said. When asked about restrictions he placed on weapons inspectors regarding which locations they could visit, Hussein responded, ""By God, if I had such weapons, I would have used them in the fight against the United States."" Hussein commented about the mental state of U.S. soldiers occupying Iraq. ""If you asked the American soldier -- who came to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction, but none could be found, and who came to remove the leaders of the Hussein dictatorship, who are all in jail now, but are replaced with other dictators -- whether he wanted to stay or go, he would say go."" Hussein said he alone gave the orders to fire SCUD missiles at Israel during the first Gulf War, adding, ""Everything that happened to us was because of Israel."" He said he figured that the United States would stop the war if Israel was ""hurt,"" and he wanted to punish the country he viewed as the source of all his problems. Hussein recalled a meeting in Switzerland between his foreign minister Tariq Aziz and then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker in January of 1991 shortly before Operation Desert Storm. According to Hussein, Baker offered no solutions to resolve the Kuwait situation and gave specific steps to Aziz that the United States wanted Iraq to do first, and Baker added ""otherwise, we'll take you back to the pre-industrial age."" He also told Piro he wanted to have a relationship with the United States but was not given the opportunity because in his view the United States was not listening to anything Iraq had to say. Hussein also revealed details about his security measures and movements before and after the second U.S. invasion of Iraq in March of 2003. He says he had only used a telephone on two occasions since March of 1990. He denied ever using body doubles, claiming, ""This is movie magic, not reality."" He also said he never saw his sons use body doubles. ""Do not think I am getting upset when you mention my sons. I still think about them and the fact that they were martyred. They will be examples to everyone throughout the world,"" he said. Hussein also states he was not in the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad on March 19, 2003, when it was bombed by coalition forces in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him. He says he remained in Baghdad until April 10 or 11 of 2003, when it appeared the city was about to fall to coalition forces. Before leaving the city, he said he held one final meeting with the senior Iraqi leadership and told them, ""We will struggle in secret."" Shortly after his departure from the capital, Hussein began to gradually disperse his bodyguards, telling them they had completed their duty, so as not to draw attention. Hussein also admitted that after participating in the failed assassination attempt against then-Iraqi president Gen. Abdul Karim Qasim in 1959, he had stayed at the same farm where he was captured by U.S. forces in December of 2003. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.",3,6.1760430657085035
ea1784eed9231375e41c819ef688776624f84a7b,CNN,"(CNN) -- Few can claim to have had a bigger impact on the glittering coaching career of new Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola than Juan Manuel Lillo. Guardiola won a remarkable 14 trophies in his four years at Barcelona and regards the relatively unknown Spanish coach as his mentor. Lillo took his first coaching job at the tender age of 16 and went on to manage 13 clubs in his 19-year career, including Mexican side Dorados Sinaloa, where Guardiola finished his playing career. The pair met after Lillo had led lowly UD Salamanca to the top flight when he was still just 29 and a firm friendship began. Ironically, an 8-0 Spanish league defeat by Guardiola's Barcelona lost Lillo his last coaching job, at Almeria, but the 47-year-old remains a keen student of the game. CNN World Sport caught up with Lillo to ask him about his relationship with Guardiola and his thoughts on the Spaniard's move to the league-leading German Bundesliga club. Do you think Guardiola will have a lot of success at Bayern? For example, another Champions League, a league title or two? That's something no one knows, it's all up in the air. What I do know is that he will give them a playing style that will allow them to succeed and that he will help make those players into better people and better footballers. For me, that is what success is. If the ball hits the post instead of going in the goal, no one knows. What I do think is that he will be able to take them to a level where they are always right there in a position to win. But who knows if a Chelsea comes and sends you home despite you having them on their back heels next to their own goal for 70 minutes of the match -- that's football. Do you think Bayern was a good choice? Who am I to say what is a good or bad choice for someone else, but I think people will wait to see if it goes well or badly for him to say it was a good choice. Personally, I think it was a good choice because they have quite a few players that have that criteria and quality he looks for in various positions. They have already had success playing a similar style and have tasted what it can bring them, and finally they have the money to be able to go out and get the players that they currently lack to be able to play his way. We're also talking about one of the most important clubs of all time, that has a long history and currently has a very strong squad. I think they're a really good team and that both of them made a good choice. What did you see in Pep the first time you saw him play? The first time I saw him play, it made me so ecstatic that he could always keep the entire team in his head and know what to do in each situation to benefit the whole team. And he was so young when he did that! That ability to make everyone around him better... Knowing all that, did you think he would be a good coach? You've got to remember that I've always seen a coach that used to play, never a player that used to coach. Saying that, similar to a guard in basketball or a center back court player in handball, he was a rigorous organizer. What emerged from his playing days was a man concerned with the collective. He's a very involved manager; it has something to do with his personality, I think. He's a very good person. He's the type of person who thinks of solidarity, of the needs of everyone else, so of course his style of play was like his personality. Did his success at Barcelona surprise you? People forget he worked his way up from the second team at Barcelona. They didn't have the first-team players, but it was still a difficult category with a lot of nuances. He earned his marks there and then went on to win titles. Winning a title sometimes obviously requires a bit of luck -- if luck isn't with you, you won't win anything -- and he also had players like Messi. With people like that it makes it that much easier, but regardless, the merits of Pep are that he gave them a style, a criteria of play. He gave them an order ... he's given them lots of things that allowed them to succeed. Do you think part of his decision to choose Bayern was because of the stability it offers as opposed to, for example, Chelsea? I don't know if Pep made his decision thinking in the negative aspects of other clubs. Knowing him a bit, I think he made this decision solely because of what he liked at this club rather than what he didn't like at another club. Pep follows his heart a lot, so if he liked this club, he liked it, that's it. He didn't stop to think ""in this place, there's this. In this other place there's that."" No. I don't know if Chelsea even came to him, we just know that Bayern made a move for him. Do you think if he has a lot of success at Bayern, he would go to another country/club for another challenge? I don't know, we have to wait and see. What I will say is that he's the type of person who just because things are going well, he won't necessarily stay there. And if things are going badly, he won't necessarily leave just because things are bad.",7,13.433776594872217
91626d33f32ebf3b9334a63ca6ff26c4dfb7215f,CNN,"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- As the U.S. House of Representatives resumes regular business Monday for the first time since since the January 8 Arizona shootings, the congresswoman shot in the attack continued to make progress, and mourners said goodbye to a staff member who rushed to the aid of others and a retired construction worker who died shielding his wife. U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was upgraded from critical to serious condition Sunday, eight days after being shot through the brain at a public event. ""The congresswoman continues to do well,"" University Medical Center in Tucson said in a statement Sunday. Giffords was among 19 people shot at the ""Congress on Your Corner"" event at a Tucson supermarket. Authorities believe she was the target of the mass shooting that left six dead and another 13 wounded. A 22-year-old suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is in custody. On Sunday, the funeral for Dorwan Stoddard took place in Tucson. Witnesses said when the gunfire rang out, Stoddard, 76, was trying to protect his wife, Mavy, when he was shot in the head and fell onto her. Mavy Stoddard was shot three times in her legs but is expected to recover. ""He threw himself over me,"" Mavy Stoddard said last week. ""I think it was the last shots that killed him. So he saved my life, and gave his for it. And you cannot ask for much more."" A memorial for Gabriel ""Gabe"" Zimmerman, 30, also took place Sunday. Zimmerman was director for community outreach on Giffords' staff and was engaged to be married. In addition to Stoddard and Zimmerman, those killed included 9-year-old Christina Green; Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll; Dorothy Morris, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. The contentious issue of gun control was put in the spotlight Saturday when one of the 13 wounded in the attack was involuntarily committed to a county mental services unit after he made threats against a Tea Party member at a town hall event in Tucson. James Eric Fuller, 63, photographed Trent Humphries and said, ""You are dead,"" when Humphries began speaking at the event, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan. Humphries told CNN that Fuller's comment came when the town hall discussion turned toward the issue of gun control. ""I was asked to give my thoughts on gun control laws and perhaps the passage of new laws,"" Humphries said of the incident. ""I said something to the effect that although gun rights and laws are not necessarily the primary focus of the Tucson Tea Party, our community needs to be given the opportunity to allow some time to pass and people to heal before we start this type of political dialogue.""

f25a077db258761b116e22d66f60f9cf68313d60,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""Who controls the past controls the future."" President Reagan's former aides say Obama's budget repudiates Reaganomics. It's a line from George Orwell's novel ""1984."" But it could also serve as the rallying cry for two groups battling over President Obama's ambitious domestic agenda -- and the legacy of two former presidents. Critics of Obama's proposed $3.5 trillion federal budget say he's poised to jeopardize the economic gains unleashed by President Reagan. They say he will make the same mistakes that President Lyndon B. Johnson did when he committed massive amounts of federal money to create a slew of anti-poverty programs dubbed ""The Great Society."" ""The Great Society created a lot of programs and wasted a lot of money,"" said Kenneth Khachigian, a former Reagan speechwriter and adviser. ""The biggest war on poverty was the economic boom started by Reagan."" But others like Joseph Califano Jr., Johnson's senior domestic adviser, say the notion that the Great Society was a failure is one of the ""greatest political scams"" in American history. Republican leaders who have labeled Obama's budget proposals socialist are rehashing the rhetoric their predecessors used to attack Great Society programs like Head Start 40 years ago, Califano says. ""I'm hearing the same round of arguments,"" Califano said. ""The Republicans said that if you provide Head Start and preschool education to poor kids, it would 'Sovietize' our kids and be communistic."" 'Failure' of the Great Society . The clash between both points of view centers on Obama's plan for reviving the nation's economy. The Senate and the House of Representatives passed similar versions of Obama's $3.5 trillion budget for 2010 last week. The budget didn't receive a single Republican vote in either chamber. Both chambers will meet after Easter recess to produce a final budget. Even before last week's vote, though, Obama's budget was creating a partisan wedge. Proponents said it would use trillions of dollars to transform education, spark a green industrial revolution and provide health care to all Americans. CNN political analyst David Gergen said Obama's budget ""set forth the most ambitious reform agenda of any president since Lyndon Johnson."" Gergen's comment could be taken as a compliment or a reprimand, depending on one's historical point of view. Craig Shirley, author of ""Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All,"" took it as a warning. His model for reviving the nation is Reagan, who moved ""power from the government to the people"" by cutting taxes and making government less intrusive. Shirley, alluding to an alleged Reagan quip that ""Johnson declared war on poverty and poverty won,"" says out-of-wedlock births, illiteracy and bloated federal programs increased during the Great Society. He says Medicare and Medicaid, two vaunted Great Society programs that provide health care to the poor and elderly, are now virtually bankrupt. ""All evidence says that the Great Society was a failure,"" Shirley said. Khachigian, Reagan's speechwriter, says Obama's budget would also create tension between people who fought their way up the economic ladder and those who did not. Under Obama, the well-off would be ""brought back down through higher taxes and subsidizing benefits for people who have not worked as hard."" Obama's budget is influenced by the president's previous job as a community organizer, Khachigian says. ""You can't have been a community organizer and not have in your mindset that agencies of the government exist to, as Obama said, to 'spread the wealth,' '' Khachigian said. If Obama wants to look at an economic blueprint for lifting the nation out of a nasty recession, he should look at Reagan, Khachigian says. Reagan's tax cuts helped end the deep recession he inherited when he came into office, he said. The economy took off, and everyone benefited. ""I would argue that the biggest war on poverty took place when the economy started booming in 1983,'' Khachigian said. The 'myth' of Reagan's tax cuts . Other analysts had a different take on the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and what it can teach Obama. Will Bunch, author of ""Tear Down This Myth: How the Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future,'' says Reaganomics is built on a fable. Reagan didn't prove that tax cuts and small government lead to economic growth, because he never consistently did both, he says. Bunch says Reagan did cut taxes in 1981 but raised them in succeeding years. He also expanded the federal government and created a huge national debt. ""His initial 1981 tax cuts went so far that he was actually forced to increase taxes a half-dozen times in the years that followed, something you never hear about,"" Bunch said. Obama would do better to follow the example of Johnson, not Reagan, says Califano, Johnson's senior domestic adviser. He says Johnson's Great Society was designed to give the most vulnerable Americans -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled and racial minorities -- the same opportunities as the affluent. ""The Great Society saw government as providing a hand up, not a handout,"" said Califano, who wrote about his time with the president in ""The Triumph and Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson."" He says the Great Society proved that government wasn't incompetent. Johnson persuaded Congress to pass at least 100 Great Society proposals. Programs awarded college students financial aid, gave struggling families food stamps and gave millions of Americans access to health insurance for the first time. It also reduced poverty, Califano says. About 22 percent of Americans lived below the poverty line when Johnson took office in 1963. By 1970, when the impact of Great Society programs was being felt, the poverty rate dropped to 12.6 percent, Califano says. (The poverty rate in 2007 was 12.5 percent, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.) Califano, who calls Obama's budget a logical extension of the Great Society, says Obama personally benefited from the Great Society ""crown jewel"": the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which ensured African American participation at the polls. ""My God, Obama wouldn't be president if Lyndon Johnson hadn't passed that civil rights law,"" Califano said. ""He would not have gotten the votes to get elected."" Robert Weisbrot, co-author of ""The Liberal Hour: Washington and the Politics of Change in the 1960s,'' says the Great Society also helped lay the foundation for the modern environmental movement with its passage of clean air and water laws. Read why Weisbrot says Obama can't create another Great Society . ""We can find much to celebrate in those years in the 1960s when we see a burst of reform when the government is ready to face problems openly and decisively,"" Weisbrot said. There may be, however, one point of agreement for supporters and critics of Obama's domestic agenda. It was expressed by Khachigian, Reagan's former speechwriter. When asked whether he was miffed that some people were now comparing Obama to Reagan, he said his opposition to Obama's budget was based on something deeper: fear. He says the nation could become a Failed Society if Obama's approach doesn't end a brutal recession. ""It's not a matter of pride but of practicality,"" he said. ""If this doesn't work, we're all in deep doo-doo.""",0,12.839859700282274
7fa2ccb6391af3495275f308575a677cb37f4d95,CNN,"New York (CNN) -- The 10 Haitian students from Sts. Joachim and Anne's School in New York's Queens Village boarded the yellow school bus thinking they were headed to the library on a special school trip. When they got off, however, it wasn't at a library but at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. It was the beginning of a day full of surprises. The children, ages 7 to 13, are survivors of the catastrophic Haitian earthquake of January 2010. Several of them lost friends and family and they themselves became refugees. They all have gone through trauma and have painful memories. But Wednesday was a day to put those memories aside, if even for a short while, and to enjoy a baseball game and other good times provided by the New York Yankees. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter hustled up the dugout steps and greeted the kids, ""How you doing? I'm Derek Jeter. Nice to meet you."" ""Young lady how are you?"" asked Yankee manager Joe Girardi. The Yankees call this HOPE Week. It stands for Helping Others Preserve and Excel, an initiative in which the Yankees reach out to an individual, family or organization they think is ""worthy of recognition and support."" This is the third year for the charity event. ""It's an opportunity for us to give back, but in the long run, we're the ones who are truly blessed by these people"" Girardi told CNN. The kids were treated to seeing the baseball superstars take their batting practice before the game. One of the children, Charles, got to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. After the game, first baseman Jorge Posada had the students race around the infield bases before they boarded a double-decker tour bus along with a few of the Yankees for a tour of the city. Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia said of the kids on the tour, ""Being able to hang out with them going on a bus tour in New York City, I think is pretty cool and I've never done it. The kids are excited, so we are excited."" When the kids got to midtown Manhattan, everybody piled out of the bus and into the lobby of the Empire State Building for the ceremonial lighting of building, followed by a skyline view from the 86th floor observatory. Nine-year-old Frantz Blues summed it up pretty well when he said, ""New York is really, really big."" From there it was onto a pizzeria, where Derek Jeter boarded the bus with some pies. He knew the kids were glad to see him, but not because of his 3,000-plus hits: ""It's fun, but you know I think the kids are more happy with the pizza than me showing up."" The children's principal, Linda Freebes, acknowledged what the day meant for the youngsters: ""I'm sure that they will treasure this memory forever. And all the unhappiness they had, this is a glimmer of sunshine and hope in their lives.""",7,9.751348029931243
a7ff1d8ffc8274a4686c3960a86b401fe2d1fd05,CNN,"BURSA, Turkey (CNN) -- Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian Wednesday became the first Armenian head of state to travel to Turkey to attend a soccer game between the two countries' national teams. Armenian President Serzh Sarkasian (right) pictured with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul during Gul's visit to Yerevan in 2008. Sarkisian and Turkish president Abdullah Gul arrived at the stadium in Bursa together in a car flying the national flags of both countries. In an exclusive interview with CNN before the game, Gul said the event opened a new chapter for relations between Armenia and Turkey. But when asked, he avoided saying whether the border between the two neighbors would be opened before 2010. At the match, Turkish supporters vastly outnumbered Armenian fans and gave the Armenian national anthem the standard treatment for most visiting foreign teams -- they booed. Small pockets of Armenian supporters waved the tri-color flag of Armenia. Turkey won the World Cup qualifying group game 2-0 but with both countries already unable to progress to the 2010 tournament in South Africa, the significance of the game was in its symbolism. This round of ""football diplomacy,"" comes just days after the two governments signed a historic series of protocols to establish diplomatic relations between the two neighbors. ""This is going to be the biggest change in the South Caucasus since 1994,"" said Gevorg Tel-Gabrielyan, the Armenia country director for the Eurasia Partnership Foundation. He was in Bursa on Wednesday, hosting a conference of Armenian and Turkish academics examining bilateral relations. ""If this happens,"" he added, ""its going to change geopolitics in the region."" Armenia and Turkey have been separated by nearly a century of animosity and distrust. The protocols call for establishment of embassies in each others' capitals, and for re-opening the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed since 1993. The soccer game was also being held in Bursa, which centuries ago was the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Thousands of police were deployed to maintain strict security. On Tuesday, Turkey's prime minister made a public appeal to Turkish football fans, to greet Sarkisian with hospitality and to avoid provocations. Despite strong support from the United States, the European Union and Russia, there is considerable opposition among nationalists in Turkey and Armenia to the peace process. Sarkisian has been met by angry protests both within Armenia and among the influential diaspora communities in the United States, France and Lebanon. Thousands of protesters in the Armenian capital marched to the country's genocide memorial chanting ""no concessions to the Turks,"" last week. Armenia has long demanded that Turkey recognize the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turkish soldiers as genocide. Modern-day Turkey vehemently denies a genocide took place and is calling for an international commission of historical experts to examine these tragic events. Meanwhile, opposition party leaders in Turkey have criticized the agreement, as has Turkey's close ally in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan fought and lost a war against Armenia in the early 1990s. On Sunday, Turkey's prime minister made a fresh call for Armenia to withdraw its troops from the disputed Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. For the new agreement to go into effect, the documents must first be put to a vote in the Turkish and Armenian parliaments. There is no guarantee lawmakers will ratify the agreement. The process of unraveling the complicated network of regional, domestic and historical grievances dividing Armenia and Turkey was jump-started in September of 2008, when Gul traveled to Yerevan to attend a football match between the two national teams. The diplomatic rapprochement has also gotten valuable support from powerful patrons, experts say. ""This is one of the few places in the world where Russia and the United States are pulling in the same direction,"" says Hugh Pope, an expert on Turkey with the International Crisis Group. ""Both want to see a more stable Caucasus."" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were both present at the signing ceremony for the Turkish-Armenian agreement in Switzerland on Saturday. Wednesday's game in Bursa was the final match for the coach of the Turkish national team, Fatih Terim, who announced his resignation after Turkey's most recent football defeat. Despite that, the headline in one of Turkey's biggest newspapers billed today's football game ""Our most challenging match.""",7,6.894156044556632
95be632e205a22176054390bd0921967868a3732,CNN,"Incheon, South Korea (CNN) -- A small army of elite, highly trained clones are sent on a mission to root out drugs and ammunition from the city. Every few hours they report back to their masters, to whom they've been devoted since birth. But this isn't the set of a low-budget sci-fi flick; it's the departure lounge of South Korea's Incheon Airport, where seven ""super clone"" sniffer-dogs have been dispatched in the war against contraband luggage. The pack of golden Labrador Retrievers are all genetically identical to ""Chase,"" whose legendary snout kept him top of Incheon's drug-detection rankings right up until his retirement in 2007. But now after years of training, the new class is following in their genetic donor's paw-prints, consistently outperforming the rest of South Korea's naturally born sniffers in the hunt for heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. Interactive: A day in the life of an airport city . They are the work of Professor Byeong-chun Lee, who established his reputation in 2005 as the driving force behind Snuppy (an amalgam of Seoul National University puppy), the world's first ever dog clone. ""The officers in Korean Custom Service read our dog-cloning article and they suggested the project to us,"" recalls Lee. Indeed, Korean customs had a problem on their hands. Only three out of every 10 selectively bred sniffer dogs that it trained --- at a cost of about $40,140 each -- had the nostrils and the discipline for the job. Although the seven Labrador clones cost upwards of $100,000 each, every single one of them made the grade. But Lee refuses to take all the credit: ""I think half of the ability comes from the genetic background and half comes from the training,"" he said. Lending weight, if it were needed, to the claim that aptitude is indeed a balance of nature and nurture, the dogs still display variations in performance despite their identical genes. And leader of the pack is Tutu. ""Last year, he won a medal for detecting the most drugs at the ICN (Incheon) airport,"" boasts his long-time handler Park Ji-yong. Like his septuplet brothers, Tutu began training for the job at the age one and now, as a mature four year-old, works five to six hourly shifts a day. ""He's very active and energetic...He's kind of tough...and he only likes me which makes me feel good,"" beams Ji-yong. But it's not just drug-mules and meth-addicts that need fear the arrival of this sniffing super-breed. Lee's next clone will be a high-performance ""quarantine dog"" -- gifted with an enhanced capacity for detecting the presence of disease in humans. Lee says that, due to the high number of travelers passing through Incheon, the airport has experienced problems with the spread of infectious diseases, ""so the Korean government have asked us to clone some quarantine sniffing dogs"" Beyond the airport barriers, Professor Lee spends his time cloning a variety of other canine breeds, each with a specific purpose in mind. ""Some clients want to replicate their own pets"" says Lee. In other cases, the scientist works in conservation, creating identical copies of endangered animals. ""Wolves are endangered species in Korea, especially grey wolves. We collected cells from the ear of wolves...and transported to surrogate dogs and finally we produced cloned wolves"" says Lee. So, now that he's cloned man's best friend, are there any plans for man himself? ""Scientifically all the animals, including humans, can be cloned, but I have never thought about (it). It's illegal and it's an ethical problem.""",8,6.889193107811733
9dc2fcd9736961988a92980680ec1606e11b1c39,CNN,"(CNN) -- Nick Faldo knows what it takes to win the Ryder Cup -- so when he says he would rather go into battle with Rory McIlroy in his side than Tiger Woods, it is probably worth listening. Six-time major winner Faldo remains Europe's most successful player in the competition having taken 25 points from his duels against the U.S. While his captaincy during the 2008 defeat at Valhalla was firmly criticized following a disappointing defeat, he remains one of the most iconic figures of the competition. Azinger slams Ryder Cup rival Faldo . With the U.S. and Europe set to go head-to-head at Medinah Country Club in Chicago on Friday, world No.1 McIlroy is expected to lead the charge for Jose Maria Olazabal's team. The 23-year-old has enjoyed a sensational run of form, winning the 2011 U.S. Open and the 2012 PGA Championship and more recently the Deutsche Bank Championship, before pocketing a cool $3 million at the FedEx Cup last weekend. Those achievements have convinced Faldo to back a man playing in just his second Ryder Cup tournament ahead of 14-time major champion and current World No.2 Woods . ""I'd pick Rory,"" said Faldo. ""They're both really marked men now. ""Rory is at the top of the game and everybody in America wants to beat him now and at 23 he has a pretty daunting job on his shoulders. McIlroy dismisses claim that Tiger is 'intimidated' ""You send out your teams you think are going to give you a point but he's a marked man so it gives him a moral victory if somebody beats him as well and that's what I'm trying to say. ""It's the same with Tiger. I think Tiger has obviously changed a lot. I think he recognises the importance of having that team around him and how good it is for him to do his bit for the team. ""Every player would love to do their part for the Ryder Cup team."" Europe triumphed by a single point at Celtic Manor two years ago with Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell sinking the winning putt following his titanic tussle with Hunter Mahan. Europe beats U.S. to win Ryder Cup . A quick glance at the world rankings shows that Europe has four players inside the top five with Woods at No.2 separating the likes of McIlroy from Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Justin Rose. But the U.S. is looking a far more accomplished team this time around with the likes of Brandt Snedeker hoping to build on his stunning Tour Championship and FedEx Cup victory. U.S captain Davis Love III also has the likes of Bubba Watson, Jason Duffner and Webb Simpson to call on in addition to the more experienced players such as Steve Stricker, Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk. ""On paper you look at the two teams and they're really well matched,"" said Faldo. "" Both teams have got bombers, both teams have got steady-eddies and both have got fiery putters . ""At the start of the year I said it would maybe be a tie to try and dismiss the question early on. But now it could be. ""I'm not sitting on the fence, it could be a point either way and who knows who is going to get the momentum. ""I'm split in the middle and it could well be a tie.""",7,10.785962550895405
f29085b4dbb667f259acc207e542e2562dc71d92,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Spanish football season is set to get under way this weekend, after strike action by players which forced the opening round of fixtures to be postponed was ended on Thursday. Players from Spain's top two divisions went on strike earlier this month, in a bid to force the league to increase the fund which protects players' wages should clubs experience financial difficulties. The strike ended after the Spain's Professional Football League (LFP) guaranteed the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) payments owed to 200 players would be made. ""The Strike Committee of AFE and the LFP have reached an agreement which guarantees through various means the salaries of footballers,"" read a statement on the AFE's official web site. How match fixing ruined the beautiful game . ""After the meeting held today on August 25th, 2011 between the AFE and the LFP, the strike planned for Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, Sunday 28th and Monday 29th has been called off."" Another result of the talks is that players will now be able to leave their club if they are owed three months wages or more. The resolution means the season will now begin with the second round of fixtures, with the first match of the campaign set to be Real Sociedad's trip to Sporting Gijon. ""We want to thank all the Spanish and non-Spanish footballers that play in our league championship,"" continued the statement. ""We want to let you know how proud we are of all of them, for their show of unity and solidarity without precedent that they gave for many companions who were going through truly tough times."" Reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona will not start their domestic season until Monday, due to their participation in Friday's European Super Cup match against Porto. Their opponents will be last term's third-place team Villarreal, who defeated Danish outfit Odense on Tuesday to reach the groups stages of the European Champions League. Last season's Copa del Rey winners Real Madrid kick-off their season away to Real Zaragoza on Sunday. As the strike in Spain came to an end, Italian players moved a step closer to similar action after the country's clubs voted in favor of changes to the collective contract signed by all footballers. Teams in Italy's Serie A, the top division, and Serie B, the second tier, want to hand coaches the power to force unwanted players to train away from the first team. They also want to introduce changes to the tax paid by the competition's highest earners. ""We dictated the precise conditions yesterday to renew the collective agreement. Our demands are reasonable and balanced,"" Serie A chief Maurizio Beretta told the league's official web site.

a1915f45feb6e03bf0b51eddfd1277fd0afd8253,CNN,"Editor's note: Wayne LaPierre has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America since 1991. His latest book is ""The Global War on Your Guns: Inside the U.N. Plan to Destroy the Bill of Rights."" Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S. (CNN) -- Here's a summary for the time- or attention-challenged: Never surrender freedom for laws that can't affect criminals; they disobey laws for a living. Nobody is surprised that Attorney General Eric Holder wants to make good on his promise to ban guns. We just didn't know whose tragedy he'd seize to advance his agenda. Now we do. It's the drug-driven death and violence in Mexico at the hands of ruthless criminal cartels. Barely a month on the job, Holder cited the Mexican cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the Clinton gun ban. Though a new face to some, Holder is a rabid Second Amendment foe from the Clinton administration who helped orchestrate the 1994 Clinton gun ban. America has made this mistake already. So let's learn the lies that led to their gun ban. Even earthworms learn from experience . Ask any anti-gun politician to define an ""assault weapon,"" and the honest answer is, ""I know one when I see one."" When cosmetics alone can infringe constitutional freedoms, we're all in trouble. But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about. The gun-ban lobby and national media lied with lockstep conformity by playing endless footage of fully automatic machine gun fire. They fooled the American people and the U.S. Congress into thinking they were banning ""high-powered,"" ""rapid-fire,"" ""battlefield-bred"" guns designed to ""spray fire from the hip."" None of that was true. Then Sen. Dianne Feinstein convened anti-gun bureaucrats to conduct a firearm beauty pageant. They browsed photos of hundreds of perfectly legal semiautomatic rifles. They picked 19 they deemed most military looking. And they banned them. But the guns aren't designed or used by the military. They're commonly owned semiautomatic rifles that fire one shot when the trigger is pulled. They cannot ""spray fire,"" nor are they designed to be fired ""from the hip."" Nor are they the choice of terrorists in Afghanistan or drug gangs in Mexico. They prefer fully automatic machine guns, which our soldiers use. Congress was so doubtful about the ban's effectiveness, they limited it to a 10-year experiment. So it expired in 2004, and for good reason. It was useless all along. As the study mandated by that Congress found, ""The banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders"" in the first place. The ban had absolutely no effect on gun crime. But what about Mexico? Of course, everyone's rooting for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government to crush the drug cartels' stranglehold. But our rights are not what's wrong. Nobody can substantiate claims that U.S. guns cross the border ""by the thousands"" or ""account for 95% of weapons used by Mexican drug gangs."" Because it's not true. Replying to Feinstein in subcommittee hearings last week, William Hoover, assistant director of field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said, ""The investigations we have, that we see, for firearms flowing across the border don't show us individuals taking thousands of guns a day or at a time flowing into Mexico."" Yet reporter after politician after news anchor parrot the lie as readily as high schoolers gossip, and with equal disregard for truth. That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our ""weak laws"" (read: freedoms) are to blame for ""fueling the violence"" in Mexico. Well, to believe that: . • You have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every Mexican law they want except Mexican gun laws, which they honor -- while they break America gun laws. • You have to believe that Mexico's drug cartels, which possess the wealth and armies of nations, prefer American semiauto target and hunting rifles over fully automatic machine guns and any other military arms they want to crush opposition. • You have to believe Mexican drug lords -- who make Forbes magazine's list of billionaires -- don't get large lots of weaponry on the transnational black market but instead choose to trifle with paperwork at U.S. gun stores. • You have to believe that narco-terrorists who buy fragmentation grenades, grenade launchers, explosives, body armor, biometric security equipment, infrared surveillance technology and intelligence-grade reconnaissance gear will salute and obey a new American gun law -- if only we'd pass one. Get real, get tough, but get away from our rights . Everything Mexico's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal. At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess. Even Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, ""We have the laws we need. We just need to more effectively enforce them."" Those that make possible Mexico's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners, but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs, state bureaucrats and military officers. A $40 billion criminal enterprise could not exist without the complicity of these powerful co-conspirators. And these cartels are being abetted by American media and politicians who blame our freedoms for it. We should seal the border. Punish the guilty. And use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in Mexico. But leave American freedoms alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wayne LaPierre.",1,7.513534617101051
33bf5f5f3e4acecfe3e6d34c0c1d6cb445bc88b9,CNN,"Paris, France (CNN) -- Some of the Roma deported from France said Friday they plan to return as soon as possible. They flew Thursday to Romania on a French flight, the first of several scheduled to take Roma out of France in the coming days. The French government says the deportations are part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. They follow the government's dismantling in the past three weeks of 51 Roma camps that it called illegal. Roma in Europe: Persecuted and misunderstood . ""Over there, they were giving us food, money ... salary. Life is much better out there -- happier,"" Mariana Serban, a mother of four, told Romania's Realitatea TV. She told the reporter she did not work in France, and smiled when the reporter pointed out France would not give them any more money. ""That's what they say now, but they will give us money again,"" Serban said. Serban's oldest son, Alexandru, 12, spoke in French as he told the TV station, ""It's much better in France. I'm here now for a visit, and I will leave again. I'm staying here for two days only."" The Thursday flight carried 79 Roma out of the country, French officials said. Friday's flight, due to land in the Romanian city of Timisoara in the afternoon, had 132 Roma aboard, according to the office of Valentin Mocanu, Romania's secretary of state for Roma integration. French officials earlier said the third flight would happen Saturday, but the Romanian Foreign Ministry said it would take place August 26 and carry 159 Roma. The ministry said there will also be two flights next month, carrying 27 Roma from France to Romania. France offered 300 euros ($384) to each Roma adult and 100 euros ($128) to each Roma child who accepted the offer for a ""voluntary return."" The comments by the returning Roma may dash any French hopes that they will resume their former lives in Romania. ""They will go and meet their parents and other relatives, and after that they will return to France, I'm telling you,"" Adrian Edu, an expert on Roma issues with the Bucharest City Hall, told PRO TV. Roma are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, often in poverty. Commonly referred to as Gypsies, they tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history. Romanian President Traian Basescu said in a statement Thursday that his country would try to find a solution to the French situation. ""We understand the problems Roma camps create around French cities, and we will work with France to find suitable solutions,"" he said. Roma from Romania and Bulgaria are allowed free passage into France if they are European Union citizens. After that, however, they must find work, start studies, or find some other way of becoming established in France or risk deportation. The French government said those Roma being deported this week have overstayed the three-month limit. Two Romanian secretaries of state plan to be in Paris on August 30 to discuss the integration of Roma populations, the French Foreign Ministry said. It said Paris favors the social integration of the Roma in Romania. Mocanu's office said local authorities try to integrate the returning Roma into the workforce, offering jobs to those who come back. Roma are not obligated to accept the job offers, however, and most of the time they don't, resulting in their return to the country from where they came, the office said.

1c771cb475b88975ede7bcebcd6d76a57225517b,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- How much do Republicans fear Hillary Clinton as the likely Democratic presidential nominee in 2016? So much that Karl Rove has her in his sights. The conservative political mastermind credited with orchestrating George W. Bush's two winning presidential campaigns insinuated in a fact-challenged attack last week that Clinton was brain damaged. Condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans came quickly, but Rove achieved his goal of inserting the question of Clinton's health into the national discussion before she has declared if she will run in an election more than two years away. On Wednesday, Former President Bill Clinton came to his wife's defense, joking during a public appearance that if Hillary had brain damage, ""then I must be in really tough shape because she's still quicker than I am."" ""It's just the beginning"" ""It's just the beginning,"" he said of Rove's attack, adding that Republicans ""will still get better at it."" When it comes to playing a political card, few deal better than Rove, who specializes in undermining the perceived strengths of opposing candidates. Recall the 2004 ""swift-boating"" of John Kerry, who saw one of his biggest potential advantages -- his military service in Vietnam compared to Bush's non-participation -- turned into a liability by questions about what he did there. Now Rove takes on a former U.S. senator and secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, if she decides to run. Clinton also polls strongly against all the known potential Republican contenders, a situation that likely prompted Rove to go after her. In comments at a May 8 conference reported by the New York Post's Page Six gossip column, Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and wore ""glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury"" when she returned to public life. Both assertions were false -- she spent a few days in the hospital and the glasses help deal with double vision rather than traumatic brain damage. Nevertheless, the comments generated headlines and political chatter, including repeated discussions on CNN programs. Echo chamber . Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, said Rove lied about Clinton's health but ""he doesn't care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding."" ""It's flagrant and thinly veiled,"" Merrill said, adding that Republicans ""are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer."" As for Clinton, he said ""she is 100%, period."" Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a GOP political adversary of the Clintons in the 1990s, blasted Rove's comments as typical of what he called a Republican consulting class that ""wants to be negative, narrow, personal, avoid ideas and not have to wrestle with the big issue."" Rove's tactic not only drew attention, it linked the controversy he started to the dominant Republican attack line against Clinton so far -- her management of the September 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. House Republicans have formed a select committee on Benghazi, a step intended to keep the issue in the public eye, while Democrats oppose the move and have yet to decide if they will take part. Benghazi link . Two months after the Benghazi terror attack, Clinton suffered a blood clot following a fall. She underwent testing in a hospital, then later was admitted for a three-day stay. The health issue prevented her from testifying to Congress about the attack, and some Republicans questioned the validity of her health problem at the time. Rove brought up all that history on Tuesday when he backed away from his factual errors but stressed the overall issue of Clinton's health. ""I didn't say she had brain damage. She had a serious health episode,"" Rove told Fox News before reciting a chronology of what happened in December 2012 and January 2013. ""First she had apparently a serious virus,"" he said. ""They announced then on the 15th of December that she had at some period in the past week fallen. They didn't say when, they didn't say where. She was recovering at home."" Later in December, Rove continued, ""she goes in and turns out to have had a blood clot"" but ""they won't say where."" ""The next day, they say it is between her skull and her brain behind her right ear,"" he noted. When she testified before Congress on Benghazi on January 25, Clinton wore ""special glasses that allow her to deal with the double vision that this episode caused,"" Rove added. In response, Bill Clinton ridiculed Republican efforts to politicize the entire Benghazi issue. ""First they say she faked her concussion,"" he noted Wednesday, and now they have her ""auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead."" If elected in 2016, Clinton would be 69 when she becomes president -- the same age as Ronald Reagan when he moved into the White House in January 1981. Age a campaign issue? Republican commentators repeatedly made that point Wednesday, saying Democrats defending Clinton had questioned the age of Republicans such as Reagan, Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. John McCain when they ran for higher office. GOP strategist Kevin Madden called Rove's ""erroneous"" remarks an acknowledgment of reality rather than a strategic ploy. ""I think it was a very awkward attempt at making a pretty obvious point, which is that non-candidates, which Hillary Clinton technically is, they don't get a level of scrutiny that official candidates in a 2016 race might get,"" said Madden, a CNN contributor. Shenanigans, responded Democrats. ""It's the McCarthyism of the Internet age where you can put anything out there, make a big lie, make this thing up about 30 days in the hospital, which was patently not true, make this thing up about sunglasses,"" said Richard Socarides, a former adviser to Bill Clinton. ""It was totally fabricated. Then he pulls it back. Now we're having this whole segment on it."" Tracy Sefl, a senior adviser for Ready for Hillary, one of the super PACs formed to back a Clinton candidacy, said Rove's tactic would backfire on Republicans because it boosted support for Clinton. Madden responded that vilifying Rove amounted to a Democratic counter-strategy. ""The reason that we're talking about this today has less to do with whether or not some of the facts related to Hillary Clinton's health,"" he said. ""It has to do with the fact that now while Hillary Clinton is not an official candidate, her organization and her supporters, they're acting like one. They seized on this as an opportunity to drive a contrast with someone like Karl Rove, to express some outrage and maybe engender some sympathy for Hillary Clinton.""

44bdc0c6d4787b1cec75a742d13cdddcfb2e619d,CNN,"Vladivostok, Russia (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signaled Saturday that Congress could move to repeal Cold War-era legislation governing trade relations with Russia as soon as this month. Clinton's comments regarding the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment came as she addressed business leaders in the Russian city of Vladivostok, where she is standing in for President Barack Obama at the head of the U.S. delegation to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. ""To make sure our companies get to compete here in Russia, we are working closely with the United States Congress to terminate the application to Jackson-Vanik to Russia and grant Russian Permanent Normalized Trade Relations,"" she said. ""We hope that the Congress will pass on this important piece of legislation this month."" The Jackson-Vanik amendment was passed in 1974 as a way of pressuring Russia to allow Soviet Jews to emigrate. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, that was no longer an issue, but legislators kept the amendment on the books to pressure Russia on other issues. The United States has waived it every year since 1994, but it still violates World Trade Organization rules requiring members of the body to give one another permanent normal trade relations. Russia finally entered the WTO this summer, raising the stakes for the United States to end a measure that critics warn could end up costing it business. Clinton discussed the Jackson-Vanik amendment with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov over a working breakfast, Nuland said. ""She said that the Congress was going to start voting and that we have strongly pushed and been supportive, and we think that it's time for Jackson-Vanik to be repealed,"" Nuland said of Clinton. The Secretary of State shares the concerns of many in Congress about the human rights situation in Russia ""and we're continuing to talk to them about those issues,"" Nuland added. Clinton and Lavrov also debated the ongoing situations in Syria and Iran, Nuland said. On Syria, the themes were similar to discussions held in St. Petersburg in June, Nuland said. ""We remain extremely concerned that if the UN Security Council doesn't take a stronger stand in support of peace and security, that it is abrogating its responsibility, that we need to do it in a way where there are consequences for noncompliance, which the Russians have not been supportive of in the past and which we really think are necessary if it's going to actually advance the ball,"" Nuland said. Clinton also made clear to Lavrov that U.S. concerns extended to the ""extremely negative effect"" of the ongoing conflict in Syria on stability in the wider region, Nuland said. Clinton labels Pakistan-based group as terrorists . Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin held one-on-one talks before dinner Saturday evening, when the question of Syria came up again. They also discussed Iran, missile defense and the need for increased bilateral trade and investment in the 15-minute meeting, before turning to wild life conservation and other matters over dinner. Clinton spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda too, on issues including a hotly disputed set of small islands in the East China Sea. The question of sovereignty over the islands has led to renewed diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo in recent weeks. In the course of their meeting Saturday morning, Clinton and Lavrov signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the Antarctic and another on strengthening U.S.-Russian interregional cooperation. Clinton said the agreements would stimulate economic growth and deepen the two nations' scientific cooperation in Antarctica. ""Scientists from both our countries will work together to explore Antarctica's terrain, study the effects of climate change, and cooperate on a range of issues to better understand and protect our shared environment,"" she said. The Obama administration had previously indicated its desire to lift the Jackson-Vanik amendment as part of its ""reset"" of U.S. relations with Moscow. And in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal in June, Clinton argued that leaving the amendment in place could hurt U.S. interests. Clinton visits young nation of East Timor, misses husband's speech . Ending Jackson-Vanik is not ""a gift to Russia,"" Clinton wrote. ""It is a smart, strategic investment in one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. goods and services."" Clinton's visit to Russia is the last stop on a week-and-a-half-long trip to the Asia Pacific region. She became the first U.S. secretary of state Thursday to visit East Timor since the developing Southeast Asian nation gained full independence from Indonesia 10 years ago, meeting with President Taur Matan Ruak and Prime Minister Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao. She also stopped by Brunei. Earlier in the week, she held a series of meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, in Beijing. Her tour started in the Cook Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, followed by a visit to Indonesia, an increasingly important regional player.

c2874999a3b9f4dd664c4a710352a545ced43fb8,CNN,"(CNN) -- This may be the last time Los Angeles Lakers forward Ron Artest will answer to that name. The NBA star, who is known for his defense and unpredictable behavior, will now be known by a different name. On Friday, the basketball player formerly known as Ron Artest will officially become Metta World Peace, his publicist says. ""Metta is his official first name; which in the Buddhist tradition means loving-kindness and friendliness toward others and his last name is World Peace,"" his publicist said. The basketball star is scheduled to be at the Los Angeles County Superior Court at 8:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) where he will officially become Mr. World Peace. Artest (World Peace) joins a fraternity of sports stars who have changed their names. Kareem Abdul-Jabaar and Ahmad Rashad changed their names for religious reasons. Chad Ochocinco changed his name because .... maybe he likes incorrect Spanish versions of his jersey number? Artest's (World Peace's) reason for changing his name seems similar to the reason that former NBA player Lloyd Bernard Free changed his name to World B. Free in the 80s. ""Ron Artest, (World Peace) has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace but it took many years of research and soul searching to find a first name that was both personally meaningful and inspirational,"" his publicist said. Artest (World Peace) first announced that he was seeking the name change in the summer. At that time, some said seeing the name World Peace on the back of his jersey would be ironic given that he is known for thrashing fans in an infamous 2004 brawl during a game against the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Artest (World Peace) was suspended a record-setting 86 games for jumping into stands and punching fans during that incident when he played for the Indiana Pacers. But the new name may speak to his new reformed image. In recent years, Artest (World Peace) has shed his bad boy image and is more known for his basketball skills and his random acts of kindness. Recently, he raffled off his 2010 NBA Championship ring to help youngsters with mental illnesses and he won the NBA's citizenship award for his philanthropy in that field.

5ad43d3ebe2e19ed687b8329a9219167b639b387,CNN,"(CNN) -- Up to 334 retail marijuana stores could be licensed to set up shop in Washington state, officials said Wednesday. New proposed rules approved by the Washington State Liquor Control Board come nearly 10 months after voters passed a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use. Since then, authorities have been hashing out the details of how to regulate production and sale of the drug. Officials said they used population data to determine how many retail marijuana stores can open. ""These rules fulfill the public expectation of creating a tightly-regulated and controlled system while providing reasonable access to participation in the market,"" Sharon Foster, the board's chair, said in a written statement. The board will vote on the proposed rules at an October hearing, and producers and retailers will have a chance to apply for licenses in December. Officials estimate that 13% of marijuana users in the state will go through licensed retailers at the outset, and that the number will increase to 25% by the end of the year, according to Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesman for the liquor control board. Marijuana is illegal in the United States under the federal Controlled Substances Act.

41b7291f9871c9b0a4d91bb689589615cfc8416e,CNN,"(CNN) -- The vigilantes came to violence-torn towns with a simple pitch: Join us and fight back before the cartel kills you. For some in the western state of Michoacan, long a flashpoint in Mexico's drug war, it was an offer they couldn't refuse. They toted guns and called themselves self-defense groups as they patrolled the streets, claiming they were forced to fight the Knights Templar cartel themselves because the state had failed to protect them. They took over several communities and sent a clear message to cartel members and authorities: Keep out. But this week, the Mexican government stepped in, sending federal forces to the region and ordering the vigilante groups to lay down their weapons. The smoldering situation has become a major problem for President Enrique Peña Nieto's government, which has vowed to reduce drug violence. In some areas, it hasn't gone smoothly, with both sides refusing to back down in tense standoffs. Mexican soldiers clashed with self-defense group members Tuesday in the town of Antunez, killing at least one person. And even as federal troops patrolled the city of Apatzingan, tensions ran high after a pharmacy burned down in a suspected arson attack just blocks away from City Hall on Wednesday. By Thursday, Mexican authorities said they'd gained control of 20 municipalities in the region. But a top security official said he couldn't set a date guaranteeing when the state would be safe. Some vigilante groups have vowed not to hand over their guns until cartel leaders are captured. ""We want them to go rescue the towns where the people are still being massacred by organized crime,"" said Estanislao Beltran, a spokesman for the self-defense groups. ""When there is peace and security in our state, we will give up our weapons."" Residents, meanwhile, told CNNMexico they're caught in the middle of spiraling violence that shows no sign of slowing. And some observers say it's not clear the government crackdown is working. ""Federal authorities, instead of imposing order, instead of rescuing the cities, they are more like referees,"" Jose Antonio Ortega, president of the Citizens Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice, told CNNMexico this week. ""They are watching the civil war in Michoacan."" And the situation could have consequences beyond the state's borders, security analyst Alejandro Hope said. It's possible, he said, that the phenomenon of vigilante groups could spread. ""It is a real risk,"" he told CNN en Español. ""It is a scenario that should worry the people in charge of the country's security policies."" Resident: 'We do not know who to believe' One Michoacan resident, who asked not to be identified out of concern for his safety, said a self-defense group gave residents few options but to support them when they swooped into the town of Tancitaro, where much of the local economy depends on avocado orchards. ""The words of the self-defense groups were very clear: 'If you do not arm yourselves, you could be killed by the Knights Templar.' This was the central point,"" he recalled in an interview with CNNMexico this week. And even with an increase in government forces in the area, he said, it's a situation that isn't likely to stop any time soon, with so many decentralized groups spread across so many parts of the region. ""We think that this is going to last for months, because there is not just one person who says, 'We are going to hand over our weapons to the Army,'"" he said. ""People are very afraid. We do not know who to believe. The self-defense groups tell us one thing, and the military tells us something else."" But in the meantime, he said, vigilantes have set up roadblocks around the town. And the town's church bells have become a signal, he said, summoning vigilantes to stop cartel members from entering. Analyst: Problems paved the way for vigilantes . Self-defense groups have also surged in parts of the neighboring state of Guerrero, where government troops have struggled to put a stop to cartel violence. ""We think the government is very timid, very slow,"" Sergio Mejia, the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco, told CNN last year. ""If there is no immediate response, it leaves us no choice but to join the fight."" Several factors in Michoacan have paved the way for vigilante groups, Hope said -- especially the nature of the primary cartel operating there, the Knights Templar. It's a group with a great focus on territory, Hope said. ""And they tend to be much more involved in extortion, in robbery, and in different kinds of kidnapping, so they generate a lot more resistance than a traditional group dedicated to international drug trafficking,"" Hope said. Today's problems started in the state at least a decade ago, said Julio Hernandez Granados, a former Michoacan government spokesman. ""There were many years of abandonment in many communities,"" he told CNN en Español. That allowed drug cartels to infiltrate, strengthening their grip on daily life and threatening those who didn't obey. ""These criminal organizations would not subsist if these circumstances did not exist,"" Granados said. ""With many young people lacking education, lacking employment opportunities, they find the only path ... is to work for criminal groups."" Concerns groups could have a darker aim . Some locals view the vigilantes as heroes. Others see them as villains and have responded to their arrival by destroying property and setting vehicles ablaze to create fiery road blockades to stop them. In the past year, Hope said, even federal officials have been ""schizophrenic"" about how they approach the groups, sometimes cracking down on them and other times describing them as allies. Critics suggest the vigilante groups contain some criminals from rival gangs who are using them as a means to win more territory. Leaders of the groups have consistently denied such accusations, saying their only aim is to fight cartels and protect public safety. But Alfredo Castillo, appointed by the federal government this week to be a new commissioner heading up security in the state, offered an ominous warning Thursday. In an interview with MVS Radio, he noted that the Familia Michoacana cartel -- which eventually splintered and led to the formation of the Knights Templar -- also started out as a group that aimed to defend the state's residents in a push to kick out the Zetas. The newly formed self-defense groups, he said, could become as ruthless as the cartels they claim to oppose. ""You can start out with a genuine purpose,"" he said. ""But when you start taking control, making decisions and feeling authority ... you run the risk of reaching that point.""

fe6ba91ec80568fed87414a2e0d31a0ab3988c23,CNN,"(CNN) -- At least 25 people were killed in what the United Nations called Friday a shocking escalation of violence in Ivory Coast, wracked by an electoral crisis that many fear is sliding toward another civil war. Doctors Without Borders treated 66 people with gunshot wounds and injuries caused by shell explosions in the wake of the attacks, according to a news release from the medical aid group. Women and children were among those injured, the statement said. France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, condemned Thursday's ""deliberate massacre of civilians"" and called on the U.N. Security Council to adopt sanctions against self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo and his circle, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero. The international community has widely recognized Gbagbo's challenger, Alassane Ouattara, as the winner of a November election and the legitimate leader of the west African nation. But Gbagbo has refused to cede power, with the stalemate resulting in uncertainty and bloodshed. The United Nations refugee agency reported heavy shelling in the Abobo neighborhood of Abidjan was responsible for the deaths. Many more were injured. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon condemned the shelling and urged the U.N. Security Council to take ""further measures"" against those found responsible for the violence. He said the U.N. would ""continue to take the necessary steps to protect the civilian population."" A statement from Amnesty International provided more details about the violence Thursday. Mortar shells fell on a market, the rights group said, describing it as one of the most serious incidents in the city since the current crisis erupted. ""This afternoon, before one o'clock prayers, women were selling their goods in the market ... in Abobo,"" an eyewitness told an Amnesty International researcher. ""Everything was quiet when suddenly we heard an awful sound and a shell hit the ground. At least 10 people, mainly women, were killed and others wounded."" Another eyewitness told the group's researcher that the attacks came just after prayers.  ""A woman ... came in with her baby,"" according to the news release. ""She was hit by a shell and died in the hospital a few hours afterwards. Her baby was wounded. Another 16 month-year-old baby was killed by the same shell."" Earlier in the week, attacks were reported in other parts of Abidjan, the commercial center of Ivory Coast, said a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""We are shocked at the escalating violence in (Ivory Coast), particularly in Abidjan, where this week was by far the most violent since the post-election crisis began,""  the agency spokesman said at a briefing Friday. A UNHCR monitor reported that 30 shops were burned Thursday and empty bullet shell casings littered the streets. A community radio station was also attacked and set on fire in the neighborhood of Adjame, and sporadic gunfire was heard in several districts of Yopougon, where heavy fighting took place Monday. The intensifying urban warfare has displaced hundreds of thousands of people attempting to flee to safer ground. About 75,000 have crossed borders, most into Liberia, according to the U.S. State Department. But thousands of others are out of their homes within Ivory Coast. Humanitarian agencies have reported hampered aid distribution due to security concerns and harassment. Human Rights Watch has blamed the violence on Gbagbo's security forces and said their actions give ""every indication of amounting to crimes against humanity.""",1,9.063351912748772
b11a6d4d7e33aae2ac210cb542cea6a5845f0772,CNN,"(CNN) -- The news that America now has more cell phone subscribers than people doesn't surprise documentary filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. ""There's 5 billion cell phones on the planet, but only 2 billion people online,"" said the director, whose new film ""Connected"" explores our increasing dependence on the electronic devices we carry. Shlain seems to have a love-hate relationship with technology. In the film's trailer she recounts a story of being at dinner with a friend and pretending to go the bathroom so she could check her e-mail on her smartphone. ""Everything is happening so fast. There doesn't seem to be a lot of time to really talk about what it is doing to us,"" said Shlain, who is also a founder of the Webby Awards. ""What does it mean to be connected in the 21st century? What's the good? What's the bad? What's the hope?"" Thanks to smartphones, people aren't just connecting through calls anymore. Increasingly, they're messaging on their phones through texts, e-mail, Facebook or Twitter -- streams of incoming information that are now accessible to us anytime and anywhere we have a signal. According to a trade industry report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the United States has 327 million cell phone subscribers, more than its 315 million people. Shlain believes her film presents technology as a next step in shaping society. ""These phones extend our desire for emotional connection. So these are all expanding human capacity because it's us evolving. We continue to want to have more ways to exchange ideas and connect,"" she said. But Shlain also thinks there is a darker side to our always-on, always-connected society. ""People have gotten incredibly rude. When you are with a good friend you should not have your cell phone right here like a ticking bomb. I think there should be no texting in funerals. When you walk in to greet your husband or partner, you should not be talking on a cell phone."" In the film, Shlain ponders what the lasting impact of this information explosion will be. ""I wonder if people are going to look back on this period and say, 'I cannot believe people used their cell phones so much in every situation and there were no boundaries,"" she said. In her own life, Shlain has taken action to limit her digital diet. One day a week, she and her family have a technology shutdown. ""All of the screens go off for 24 hours and it's the most delicious, long, wonderful day. I read, I write in my journal, I hang out with my kids and my husband and the day feels like four days in one. Then we all can't wait to go back online.

09ca33226804adbcda7b17ecdb92cc345a94e2de,CNN,"London, England (CNN) -- Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset al-Megrahi is ""a very sick man,"" but there is no way to tell how long he will live, according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, saw al-Megrahi a week ago in Libya, he said Tuesday. He also criticized U.S. senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of al-Megrahi. He said he had written to them to say it was more important to let Scottish legal proceedings run their course, since a review commission had found possible miscarriages of justice in the case. ""They didn't want to know about that,"" he said of the senators, saying they had not replied to his letter. The Scottish government released al-Megrahi from prison just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months. Swire, who does not believe that al-Megrahi is guilty, defended the decision. ""At three months, just over half [of people with his cancer] would be dead,"" Swire said. But after three months, mortality rates level off, and there is no way to predict how long cancer sufferers will live, said Swire, a retired general practicioner. ""He can walk a few steps,"" Swire said of al-Megrahi. He did not ask al-Megrahi or his doctors about the Libyan's medical condition out of respect for his privacy, he said. But he said the fullness of his face suggested that he was on steroids to slow the cancer. Al-Megrahi was appealing his conviction when he was freed on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and then dropped the appeal. Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed. But al-Megrahi's death could change the legal playing field, Swire speculated. ""If he were to die, the the situation would change,"" and Swire might be able to get the case reopened, he said. He believes that al-Megrahi ""would see to it that we would be provided with all the information his defense team has assembled,"" he said, adding that the Libyan had not explicitly told him that. Swire is in the minority among victims' families in thinking al-Megrahi is innocent. American officials blasted al-Megrahi's release at the time and on the first anniversary. ""As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. President Barack Obama's assistant on homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, called the release ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted that al-Megrahi was only given three months to live when he was released but is still alive. Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya. ""A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy,"" Menendez said. ""It was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man."" Lautenberg said, ""It is the families of those victims who deserve compassion, not this terrorist."" ""Al-Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts,"" Menendez said. The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release. Al-Megrahi is the only person convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Most of the dead were Americans. The flight had been heading to New York from Frankfurt, Germany, via London, England, when it blew up.

c3b15dbeaf7a65dab60ef7218c43068d8728e200,CNN,"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 10.45 p.m. ET] . Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa concedes defeat to opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, prime minister-designate Ranil Wickremesinghe tells CNN. [Previous story, posted at 8.17 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In November, when Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa called an election two years earlier than necessary, the path ahead looked clear for an unprecedented third term in office. But as the nation of 15 million eligible voters waits for the results of yesterday's polls, the 69-year-old's electoral ambitions may be in jeopardy. After enabling an extension of his presidency by doing away with a two-term limit, Rajapaksa's campaign was spectacularly wrong-footed by the surprise defection of dozens of political allies -- including the man who now threatens to unseat him. Maithripala Sirisena, 63, was general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet when he defected. He is now challenging him for the presidency, on behalf of a broad opposition alliance analysts describe as the most serious challenge Rajapaksa has faced. The race -- which watchdogs say has been marred by hundreds of incidents of political violence and government misuse of state media -- has been too close to call. Opinion polls and analysts spoken to by CNN are divided on the outcome. ""It's not auguring very well for (Rajapaksa). He's got a contest on his hands,"" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. He said Rajapaksa, accustomed to a weak and fragmented opposition, could not have anticipated facing a united alliance of nearly 40 parties -- including 23 parliamentarians who have defected from the president's own grouping, as well as nationalists from the Sinhalese majority and Tamil and Muslim minorities in the ethnically diverse nation. ""He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena,"" said Saravanamuttu. ""I think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change."" 'Rock star appeal' Rajapaksa, a lawyer by trade, entered parliament in 1970, became prime minister in 2004 and was narrowly elected president a year later. In 2010, he was returned to power with 58% of the vote. His crowning achievement in office has been crushing the Tamil Tigers and bringing an end to the bloody 25-year civil war that had raged between the state and the Tamil separatists. The conduct of both the government and the Tamil Tigers was slammed by legal experts at the United Nations, who accused both sides in a 2011 report of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yet the victory -- delivering security and renewed prosperity to the war-ravaged nation, with an average of 7% economic growth a year during his presidency -- remains his prime political asset, says Dayan Jayatilleke, a political scientist and former Sri Lankan diplomat. ""When voters turn on their TVs and they see the attack on Charlie Hebdo, on the Pakistan school, or Boko Haram, it reminds them of how hideous it is to live under terrorism,"" he said. ""That's something the Sri Lanka voters have done for years, and whatever they think of the rest of his style of governance, they think he's the guy who made it go away."" He says the folksy Rajapaksa, whose mustached face is a ubiquitous sight on posters throughout the island nation and is frequently likened to an ancient Sinhalese king, possesses ""a rock star appeal."" But despite this, dissatisfaction appears to be growing with his rule, which is increasingly seen by some as autocratic, corrupt and nepotistic, he says. Too much power? Following his 2010 reelection, an emboldened Rajapaksa amended the constitution to concentrate power in the presidential office and remove presidential term limits. To many Sri Lankans, says Saravanamuttu, the move felt excessive. ""They want the force of the executive president trimmed or abolished."" There is also a widespread perception, says Jayatilleka, that Rajapaksa ""has been ladling out a disproportionate share of resources to his family,"" and is focused on building a political dynasty. Three of Rajapaksa's brothers occupy powerful positions: Basil is the Minister of Economic Development, Gotabaya is Defense Secretary and Chamal is the Speaker of Parliament. Minorities alienated . The country's significant minorities -- Tamils, who comprise about 15% of the population, and Muslims, who account for 9% -- have also largely thrown their lot in with the opposition, says Jayatilleke. While Muslim voters had previously supported Rajapaksa over his vocal support for Palestinians, he had ""totally alienated"" them in recent times with his perceived tolerance of monk-led Buddhist extremist group Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force), which supports Rajapaksa's bid for re-election. READ MORE: Fascists in saffron robes? The rise of the Bodu Bala Sena . Last month, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress defected to the opposition. The Bodu Bala Sena has been blamed for instigating outbursts of anti-Muslim mob violence, including a deadly rampage in the town of Aluthgama in June. READ MORE: Fear, shock among Sri Lankan Muslims in aftermath of mob violence . Sirisena's heartland appeal . Sirisena, who hails from the rice-producing North Central Province, also holds strong appeal as a candidate to Rajapaksa's traditional rural base in the ""Sinhalese heartland,"" says Jayatilleka. ""He's a Sinhala Buddhist from a peasant background -- you couldn't get more mainstream than that in Sri Lankan politics,"" he said. Jailed early in his career in 1971 during a communist insurrection, Sirisena rejoined mainstream politics through the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. While he lacks strong persona; charisma, coming across as ""a sober serious kind of man,"" Sirisena presented a more appetizing alternative to voters than other potential opposition candidates, said Jayatilleke. The opposition also benefited from having run a stronger campaign than the government, he said. So much so, Saravanamuttu says, that ""conventional wisdom suggests that (Sirisena) may have an edge"" at the polls. For his part, Jayatilleka disagrees, comparing Rajapaksa's prospects to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin during his most recent re-election. ""The international media expected Putin to lose because opinion in Moscow and St Petersburg was against him,"" he said. ""But in the provinces where most of the votes come from, they voted the other way, because Putin was seen as having crushed the Chechen terrorist threat and having restored the state of Russia in the world."" Jayatilleka's pick? ""Rajapaksa will probably lose all the cities. And the opposition, having won the campaign, will probably lose the election.""

7268d580e4503fda7ce81b9c4dc2ffb2025a7067,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- More than 1,000 American troops have now been killed in Afghanistan, according to CNN calculations. The United States passed that grim milestone Tuesday, when an improvised explosive device killed two of its troops in southern Afghanistan, bringing the total to 1,001. The death toll does not include those killed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in other countries. But the large number of casualties is in sharp contrast to the rates from another recent war. The deaths of these service members come 104 months since the start of the war in Afghanistan, compared with the war in Iraq, where more than 1,000 U.S. troops were killed in the first 18 months of fighting. But Afghanistan is getting deadlier by the day. From 2001 through 2006, the American casualty rate never reached 100 in any single year. But that number started going up in 2007 and spiked to more than 300 last year. If the current rate continues, 2010 will be the deadliest year of the war, nearly a decade after it started. The milestone comes just 24 hours after the single deadliest day for coalition forces in Afghanistan this year. Insurgents killed 12 NATO soldiers on Monday, seven of them Americans. Officials with the International Security Assistance Force say it was no single event but six separate attacks in southern and eastern Afghanistan. It was the most fatalities among NATO troops in a single day since October 26, when 11 Americans were killed in two helicopter crashes. Coalition forces are working to secure Helmand Province and establish a legitimate government there and are launching an offensive to target up to 1,000 Taliban fighters in Kandahar. ""We all expect the fight to get tougher as we carry out the new campaign,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said. Added Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, ""I think we've been very clear for months now that this was going to be a very difficult fight in the south. And the expectations, try to set expectations ... as tragic as it is, for these losses."" A defense official says that American troops and their allies are tightening security around the city of Kandahar but that the operation there will take months and will not resemble a typical battle. More than a million Afghans live in Kandahar, and the Taliban are embedded in the population. The official says the goal will be weeding out the Taliban, as well as the drug gangs and warlords that control much of the area's economy.",3,5.549609667932029
89c186d543efce324ef682cd6bf3b962a914363f,CNN,"San Francisco (CNN) -- Google has a simple and inexpensive new way to stream Internet videos on your TV. The company on Wednesday introduced Chromecast, a small device that lets you stream content to your television over a WI-Fi network, using your computer, phone or tablet as a remote control. The company said its goal is to create a device with zero setup time, no learning curve, and one that works with all platforms and devices. The $35 Chromecast is a radically different approach to TV than Google's previous failed attempt, the Nexus Q. It's smaller, cheaper and available starting today. The two-inch dongle looks like a thumb drive and pops into the HDMI port on an HDTV. It turns your phone, tablet or computer into a remote. Choose what content you'd like to stream and the Chromecast will play it on a nearby TV. ""The television is missing in the (streaming-video) picture. it is really, really difficult to get your online videos on the television,"" said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and apps, at Wednesday's press event. Google unveils upgraded Nexus 7 tablet . Chromecast supports both Android and iOS devices. At its event, Google demonstrated the device using a Windows laptop and an iPhone. Chromecast also is streaming directly from your Wi-Fi connection, so it's not draining your device's battery. That means you can multi-task, checking e-mail on your computer, tablet or phone while a custom YouTube playlist broadcasts on your TV. The device currently only streams content from YouTube, Google Play and Netflix, though more apps, such as Pandora, are expected in the future. A beta feature lets you stream any tab directly from a Chrome browser running on one of your non-TV devices. With Chromecast, Google is seeking a foothold in a small but growing field. Only 15% of households have figured out how to watch online video on their TV sets, according to Google. The device goes head-to-head with existing Internet-on-TV solutions like Apple TV or the Roku box. The Chromecast stick is on sale now in the Google Play store and at electronics retailers such as Best Buy, although it may not ship immediately.

765b575859c125a596dc341eae88e008d143aca4,CNN,"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the Oscar Pistorius murder case will make a final push Friday to keep the acclaimed track star in jail after a bail hearing jolted by the sudden removal of the lead investigator. The South African Police Service pulled Hilton Botha from the case Thursday after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him. Botha is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk in 2011. He is charged with seven counts of attempted murder. The allegations were the latest blow to a prosecution case that has suffered through several miscues during the bail hearing, including admissions that police could have contaminated the crime scene and failed to properly catalog evidence. Prosecutors are trying to keep Pistorius jailed pending his trial on a charge of premeditated murder in the February 14 shooting death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, 29. The hearing ended Thursday with no decision on bail and is scheduled to resume Friday. Pistorius, 26, is accused of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp after, according to prosecutors, a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The sprinter, however, says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired into the room in a fit of terror before realizing the person inside was Steenkamp. Replacing Botha . Court officials learned Thursday that prosecutors had restored the charges against Botha in the 2011 incident. The charges had previously been withdrawn for additional investigation, but prosecutors decided Wednesday to proceed, said Commissioner Riah Phiyega of the South African Police Service. Phiyega praised Botha, saying he is an experienced investigator who ""has presented the case of the police well."" Botha was replaced by the department's most senior detective, Vinesh Moonoo, in a move Phiyega said positioned the department for a ""long-haul"" investigation of Steenkamp's killing. During the three-day bail hearing, being held in a dark, stuffy Pretoria courtroom, defense attorney Barry Roux hammered away at the credibility of Botha and the entire police investigation. He argued police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where Steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers. Botha told Roux that investigators didn't wear the booties because they'd run out. Bulelwa Makeke, the spokeswoman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, said before the announcement of Botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a ""speed bump"" in the Pistorius case. Gallery: Athletes charged with murder . Monumental collapse? In arguments wrapping up Thursday's session, Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius' defense team has failed to explain why investigators found two cell phones and the gun believed to have been used in the shooting in front of the shower. That goes to the prosecution claim that Steenkamp didn't merely get up to relieve herself in the middle of the night, but in fact had locked herself in the bathroom with her cell phone to protect herself from Pistorius. Nel also said Pistorius has shown a lack of realization of what he has done and cast doubt on Pistorius' claims that one of the reasons for his extreme fear that night was that he had been a victim of burglary and violent crime in the past. Where, Nel asked, are the court cases from those incidents? Why, Nel asked, didn't Pistorius whisper to Steenkamp or try to wake her up when he heard noises? In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court . In addition to his questions about the bullet and the booties, Roux got Botha to acknowledge during the hearing that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. Roux told Magistrate Desmond Nair that the prosecution's case had suffered a monumental collapse. The defense attorney also questioned police claims that a witness who lived at least 300 meters (328 yards) from Pistorius' home had heard a raging argument coming from the home. He also said officers had failed to properly investigate and catalog evidence found there, including ammunition and a bottle of what Botha first called testosterone before backtracking. Roux said the substance is an herbal remedy. Authorities have argued that ballistic evidence shows Pistorius had to intentionally target the toilet to strike Steenkamp, and that evidence shows he was standing on his prosthetic legs when he shot through the bathroom door. Pistorius said in his statement that when he shot through the door, he was feeling vulnerable to an intruder because he was not wearing his legs and had limited mobility. Prosecutors are fighting bail because they worry that Pistorius will disappear if he's released, and they say that he has a history of police encounters that suggest he is a threat to public safety. Pistorius has pledged to stay in South Africa and fight the charges if released, adding that he's unlikely to escape notice as a well-known athlete who walks on prosthetic legs. His family issued a statement Thursday afternoon through Vuna Reputation Management, saying that they ""fully respect the bail hearing process."" ""They understand it is in the full interest of justice that the process associated with the bail application be followed in its entirety"", said Arnold Pistorius, Oscar Pistorius' uncle and family spokesperson. ""We are strong and supportive as a family, for Oscar, but we understand that this is in the best interest for all."" Anger about detention . In other developments, the women's branch of South Africa's ruling party accused authorities of giving Pistorius special treatment by holding him at the police station instead of prison. ""If there is some special circumstance that permits this, authorities must share this with the public as they are setting a bad precedent,"" the statement from the African National Congress Women's League said. ""All should be treated equally before the law no matter your standing in society."" What's life like in a South African prison? Nike pulls away from sprinter .

11e37c69fcbbb24d92401c1c5f5f76692790fef5,CNN,"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nneka and Chimezie Ononaku unwittingly poisoned their own four-month-old son Chinonso. A television image of Chinonso Ononaku, who died after being given the medicine ""My Pikin."" Giving him what they thought was a baby teething medicine, they were in fact dosing him with anti-freeze. The bottle had been contaminated with a toxic chemical called diethylene glycol. More than 30 Nigerian children are thought to have died recently after taking the medicine. Nneka is angry. ""It's not easy carrying a pregnancy for nine months, [and] after that getting a drug from a pharmacy to kill your own child,"" she says. When Nigeria's Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) tested the medicine, ""My Pikin,"" the results were terrifying. It found the medicine contained almost 90ml of diethylene glycol per 100ml. ""It's a bottle of poison,"" the NAFDAC laboratory said.

d7207f853978c9330348da1615cb951b94a43352,CNN,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two days after Hong Kong's chief executive relented to protesters' demands to drop a controversial Chinese education requirement, pro-democracy legislators Monday got a boost from a majority turnout at the polls. More than 1.8 million people -- or 53% of registered voters -- turned out at the polls Sunday, and pan-democrats won more directly elected seats than the pro-Beijing camp, as well as three of the five so-called super seats. However, pro-Beijing legislators still maintained their dominance at the Legislative Council, thanks to infighting among the pan-democratic factions -- and a system that combines direct and indirect voting via special interest groups. Under Hong Kong's political system, 35 seats are elected directly by the public (""geographic constituencies"") and 35 by groups based on professions (""functional constituencies""), most of which lean pro-Beijing. In a new complex ""one person-two votes"" arrangement, voters can cast ballots not just within their geographic constituency but also for a list of candidates vying in a ""super lawmaker"" functional constituency. With 27 -- or more than a third -- of the 70 seats won Monday, pan-democrats will still wield veto power and can block constitutional changes. The election comes on the heels of a 10-day hunger strike to protest ""Moral and National Education,"" a curriculum that critics likened to ""brainwashing"" with Chinese propaganda. On Saturday, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung said the decision to teach it would be left to schools. While the emotionally charged education issue led to higher turnout at the polls, the pro-Beijing camp benefited from split votes among the pan-democrats, thanks to bitterness within the coalition over 2010 electoral reforms, one political observer said. Read about the curriculum issue that sparked protests . The radical People Power group had called on supporters to cast blank ballots as a form of protest against pan-democratic parties that sided with the government on the reform package, arguing that it stymied Hong Kong's path to a full democracy, according to the South China Morning Post. By noon Monday local time, Albert Ho had resigned as leader of the Democratic Party after a poor showing in the elections, even though he was among the lists of candidates that won ""super lawmaker"" seats. ""Pro-democracy voters went for parties that didn't have that kind of bitterness between them,"" said Michael DeGolyer, a professor of government at Hong Kong Baptist University and director of the Hong Kong Transition Project. Among the beneficiaries in the elections were the Civic Party and the new Labor Party, which represent the interests of labor, unionists and populists committed to social programs, he said. ""I don't think we'll have progress on the pro-democracy front for a while,"" DeGolyer said. He predicted that Leung may find himself trying to build capital with legislators who are more welfare-oriented and with voters fed up with corruption scandals that dogged his predecessor, Donald Tsang. The elections are the fifth since Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to China in 1997 and became a special administrative region under a ""one country, two systems"" model.

d6216d8ce41ed194a1a160f65d2eb7b0cf3c3d59,CNN,"(CNN) -- Miracles do happen. Like this week, when Amanda Berry, Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight escaped their captor after being missing for a decade. It turned out they were locked away and alive the entire time. Their fortuitous escape is like a ray of light and reminds us that sometimes good things do happen. A cry for help came out from the walls of silence, and a member of the community responded, aiding in the rescue. The selfless act of a total stranger only reinforces that the public will help when needed. But their story is unusual. Many missing persons who have been missing for a long time are still not found. We should urge all communities to play an integral part in assisting law enforcement in investigations about missing persons. We live in a world filled with powerful technology that has enabled us to communicate faster and better, yet we seem to lack the simple face-to-face meeting that must take place when searching for clues and information in any type of investigation. At-a-glance: Still missing in the U.S. The old ""knock and tell"" method remains an effective tool today. It must be used when searching for our missing persons. When you talk to someone in person, you can read them better by registering their expressions, gestures and other factors. Sometimes, those things could yield clues. This door-to-door technique can make the difference in finding someone in hours, days or years. There's no doubt that trying to find missing persons requires a tremendous amount of work. Classifying cases as ""runaways"" or ""walk-aways"" does nothing to help the outcome of any given case. If anything, it could hinder and slow the process. The general public normally will not have a heightened sense of concern for those believed to have left on their own. The sense of urgency and hitting the ground running from the start could be the difference in many missing person cases. A case can be misdiagnosed upon closing; this is when we confirm that the labeling provided a wrong direction. The word ""missing"" should be enough and important; the alert(s) system in place such as the Amber/silver provide an additional emergency notification seeking the public's help. The myth of ""a waiting period"" to report a missing person still lingers, and many families are turned away by officials and forced to begin their journey on their own without any direction or support. Due to heavy caseloads, law enforcement officials are frequently not afforded the continuous training and education that could help them in the search for a missing person. Abused but alive: Lessons from survivors . All too often, information is not provided to victims suffering a missing loved one in the onset, such as where to file the report and what agencies can provide support services and help with advocacy and on-the-ground services. These are all key issues that need to be addressed as we move forward to bring home those missing in our country. Cold cases and unidentified persons need to be revisited and reopened. All cold cases need to be updated and looked at again with a keen eye on what can be done to aid in a recovery. As we rejoice in the happy ending for the three women and their families and friends, we need to be reminded that there is still much work to be done in the world of the missing. We need to remember that there are thousands of people who are still seeking resolution and waiting for answers concerning their loved one. As a community, we need to come together, take notice and become aware of what happens in our homes, neighborhoods, towns and cities. And we need to always remember that ""every missing person is somebody's child."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Monica Caison.",4,15.109311872374121
c2d90734f9228cf3163187ad72405c90bb09d13b,CNN,"(CNN) -- Swiss super-combined world skiing champion Daniel Albrecht was airlifted to hospital after a sickening crash on Kitzbuehel's Streif course on Thursday. Albrecht nose-dives down Kitzbuehel's Streif course after crashing during training for a World Cup downhill. Albrecht, who was said to have suffered concussion and bruising to a lung, was in training for the weekend's World Cup downhill at the Austrian venue when he lost control approaching the bottom of the run. The 25-year-old received lengthy treatment on the slopes before being flown to hospital at St. Johann, where he regained consciouness before being put in an induced coma. An induced coma puts the brain in hibernation so it can recuperate and allows swelling in the brain to ease. Helmuth Obermoser, the official race doctor, said in a brief statement that Albrecht had bleeding on the brain and a lung contusion. Albrecht took the season's opening giant slalom at Solden in October and scored a second victory and fourth of his career two months later in Alta Badia, Italy, where he became the first Swiss winner in 10 years. Thursday's fall came on a similar section at Kitzbuehel that saw American Scott Macartney suffer head injuries in a crash last season -- an episode that led officials to make changes to the course.",2,10.556538629797135
0eac5ea92cd5e6c03bc529eac285dccb20271824,CNN,"(CNN)The latest Charlie Hebdo cartoon, produced after last week's horrific attacks on the Paris magazine's offices, literally adds insult to injury.  Admittedly a portrait in mixed messages, the cover reads ""All is forgiven"" above a drawing of the Prophet Mohammed, who is holding a ""Je suis Charlie"" sign.  Who, exactly, is supposed to be doing the forgiving and who must be forgiven is not clear. Zineb El Rhazoui, a writer with Charlie Hebdo, said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings.  But the cover could also be interpreted as Mohammed saying he forgives the cartoonists in a way the terrorists, obviously, did not. But the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant. As Middle East analyst Juan Cole has argued, they were just an excuse for Islamic zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between Islam and ""the West.""  Cole writes, ""Al Qaeda wants to mentally colonize French Muslims, but faces a wall of disinterest. But if it can get non-Muslim French to be beastly to ethnic Muslims on the grounds that they are Muslims, it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination.""  Enter the cartoons. This is why it is baffling that political voices around the world, especially conservatives, have argued that we must show our support for Charlie Hebdo and free speech by reprinting the magazine's offensive cartoons. Remember, this is a publication few outside France had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read -- and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context. In fact, in a line of thinking best articulated by New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Ross Douthat, the violent reaction to Charlie Hebdo's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest.  ""If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said,"" wrote Douthat.  In other words, the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but valorizes its rationale going forward? Some have indeed argued that because some radical Islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against Islam as different from those directed at Judaism or Christianity.  This ignores, for example, mass murderer Anders Breivik, who left a 1,500 page manifesto proclaiming himself ""100% a Christian"" and advancing his vision of a ""monocultural Christian Europe."" In 2011, Breivik killed 77 people in Norway.  Does that attack justify blasphemy against Christianity and make it incumbent on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest?  The likely response -- that violence inspired by Christianity or Judaism is somehow an exception while violence inspired by Islam is a rule --i s merely a way of justifying in hindsight and in perpetuity smears against a group one has already decided to hate. As Adam Shatz at the London Review of Books has noted, right-wing fascists in France and Europe more broadly share an organizing principle with jihadists: ""that there is an apocalyptic war between Europe and Islam.""  Blanket incriminations of the whole of Islam based on the acts of zealots help feed the premise.  So do cartoons that blaspheme the Prophet Mohammed. Though it's perverse to demand all Muslims apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith, since the Paris attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate Muslims have spoken out.  And yet perhaps part of the reason we don't hear enough from these voices is that they simply don't fit the narrative fueled by the zealots in Islam and ""the West"" and happily covered by the apocalypse-loving media. This would also explain why the media and ""the West"" are still fixated on the slaying of 17 people in France and paying infinitely less attention to as many as 2,000 people killed in Nigeria by Boko Haram.  It falls outside the ""us versus them"" frame — and is further evidence that, as protesters in the United States have been asserting, black lives simply aren't treated as though they matter. I unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech.  Unfettered free speech is essential to any democratic and pluralistic society.  So I support the right of Charlie Hebdo to print the most outlandish, offensive cartoons it can come up with.  And, to give another example, I support the free speech rights of French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala — even though I personally find his anti-Semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons I've seen. Still, I don't think M'bala M'bala should be facing prosecution by the French government for his speech, as he has apparently 38 times.  Curiously, I don't see those rallying supposedly in support of free speech protesting M'bala M'bala's repeated prosecution.  At the same time, many of those supposedly proclaiming support for free speech are shaming and smearing media outlets that choose not to reprint the Charlie Hebdo drawings. The fascist right-wing and fundamentalist Islamists want the same thing: to convince Muslims and ""the West"" that there is an inherent divide between the two. The question for the rest of us — the ones who have free speech — is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it. A few fanatical Islamists have horrifically and unimaginably offended the world. That's no excuse for anyone to go on offending all Muslims.  To do so only helps advance the terrorists' goal.",1,6.787510942006155
346ef8f251b31081ba0adfcfddc65d1fe5d76023,CNN,"(CNN) -- The flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States has slowed in the past three years, a major think tank reported Thursday. Illegal immigrants are processed in August at a U.S. Border Patrol station near Laredo, Texas. The Pew Hispanic Center report cites no statistical reasons for the decreased rate. It notes that the U.S. economy has suffered a downturn and that greater immigration enforcement measures have been enacted, which a Pew survey ""indicates has generated worry among many Hispanics."" According to the center's estimates, 11.9 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States as of March. There were 11.1 million in 2005 and 8.4 million in 2000, the group said. ""Although the undocumented population has been rising, its net growth has slowed substantially since 2005, compared with earlier in the decade,"" the report states. According to the report, from 2000 to early 2005, the unauthorized immigrant population grew by an annual net average of about 525,000. The growth pattern started changing substantially in 2005. From 2005 to 2008, annual growth has averaged 275,000 undocumented immigrants.  See how the numbers stack up » . ""With the drop in the numbers of illegals coming, we now have more legal immigrants coming than illegals coming,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, the study's lead researcher and author. Unauthorized immigrants continue to make up 30 percent of the nation's foreign-born population of more than 39 million people, the study says. Mexicans account for 58 percent of all illegal immigrants in the United States, the study says, adding that no other country has a double-digit share. Pew estimates that there were 7 million illegal Mexican immigrants living in the United States in March, up considerably from 4.8 million during the 2000 Census. Growth has leveled off since 2007. The number of undocumented immigrants in the United States from Latin American countries other than Mexico grew from 1.8 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2008, an increase of nearly 45 percent. That population reached 3 million in March 2006 but has declined since then, the report said. A previous Pew Hispanic Center showed that immigration from Mexico ""varied substantially directly related to the employment situation in the United States,"" Passel said. That appears to be the case now, he added. ""This slowdown [in the U.S. economy], if anything, hits some sectors that undocuments [illegal immigrants] are involved in very hard: construction, obviously, being a big one,"" he said. ""The other side of it is that a lot of Latin American economies are holding their own or doing well."" Stricter law enforcement has not been confined to the U.S.-Mexico border, Passel said. ""The other big difference over the past couple of years is that we've seen greater enforcement in the interior, at the work sites,"" he said. ""Numerically, there may not have been a big impact in terms of the numbers of people arrested and deported, but it's been very high profile. There's strong communication between the United States and the home country, so word gets back."" Among the study's other findings: . • More than 40 percent of the nation's undocumented immigrants -- 5.3 million people -- have arrived since the decade began.  • About 80 percent of undocumented immigrants come from Latin American countries. In March 2008, 9.6 million people from Latin America were living illegally in the United States. Another Pew Hispanic Center study released Thursday looks at the economy, saying the current economic slowdown ""has taken a far greater toll on non-citizen immigrants than it has on the United States population as a whole."" According to an analysis of new Census Bureau data, the median annual income of non-citizen immigrant households fell 7.3 percent from 2006 to 2007. In contrast, the median annual income of all U.S. households increased 1.3 percent during the same period, the report says. Immigrant heads of household who are not U.S. citizens are more vulnerable, the report says, because ""most arrived in the U.S. in recent years with only a high school education or less. Many are employed in blue-collar production and construction occupations or lower-rung occupations in the service sector."" The majority (56 percent) of non-citizen households are Hispanic. And nearly half (45 percent) of non-citizen households are headed by undocumented immigrants.

5e3a9ffbf305e15d822cbca3b88dd7bfc05981fb,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tributes have been flooding in following the sudden death of Spanish Primera Liga side Espanyol's captain Daniel Jarque at the age of 26 on Saturday night. Espanyol fans have begun a memorial for captain Daniel Jarque following his sudden death on Saturday. Jarque passed away around 8pm local time when his heart stopped following a training session in Coverciano, Italy, where the squad are on a pre-season camp. Reports suggest Jarque was on the phone to his fiancee -- who is eight months pregnant -- at the time and she alerted two of his team-mates, who raced to his hotel room. Club doctors and Italian paramedics tried to revive Jarque, a product of the Espanyol youth system, but without success. Most Spanish clubs immediately expressed their condolences and leading footballing personalities have now done the same. Speaking on the official Real Madrid Web site, club captain Raul said: ""As captain, and on behalf of the whole Real Madrid team, I want to express our sincere condolences. ""We will support the player's family and the Espanyol family in any way possible during this very difficult time for everybody. ""He was a great professional and sportsman and this has left us all very hurt. We offer our most sincere sympathies,"" added Raul. Jarque's death comes two years after that of Sevilla and Spain defender Antonio Puerta, who suffered multiple organ failure in hospital, three days after a cardiac arrest during a league match against Getafe. Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini added: ""It is news that you wish wasn't true. It's terrible, it already happened a couple of years ago to Sevilla and the truth is these things have an impact."" Joan Laporta, president of European champions Barcelona -- Espanyol's city rivals -- said on their official Web site: """"We are very shocked by this tragic event. ""We are all in mourning and I wish to express in the name of FC Barcelona our heartfelt condolences to Espanyol on the painful loss of their captain Dani Jarque, and also to his family"". Jarque joined Espanyol at the age of 12, making his debut in 2002, and was handed the captaincy this summer. Fans have been flocking to Espanyol's stadium since the news broke and have been in mourning outside gate 21 -- Jarque's squad number. Former Espanyol coach Ramon Moya, who handed Jarque his debut against Rayo Vallecano, was deeply shocked. ""I feel like I have lost a son,"" he told reporters. ""Jarque was a footballer, but he was also my friend. This situation is very difficult for a person. It was as if he was family. I knew him for many years. I gave him his debut and I shared many moments with him. It's very difficult to explain how I feel at the moment."" Another former coach, Ernesto Valverde, insisted Jarque had never had any medical problems previously. ""After hearing the news I still haven't taken it in,"" said the current Villarreal coach. ""He was a player who was super strong, super healthy and very important in the dressing room. We got goosebumps when we heard the news. He was a very strong person but life is like that and it gives you terrible surprises. "" Espanyol, who had been due to play Bologna in a friendly match on Sunday, suspended their pre-season tour of Italy and have flown back to Barcelona.",8,8.888300506932024

Chris Christie said Friday that he expects power to be almost fully restored statewide by Saturday night. ""Life will be back -- for most of New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,"" he told reporters. More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark, and homes with saltwater electrical damage will have to be inspected by electricians before having their power restored. ""Some of those homes have already been disconnected,"" said Chris Eck, a spokesman Jersey Central Power & Light, the state's second largest power provider. ""We can't energize the circuit until we know the system is safe."" Christie's comments came after a tour of the Jersey shore, where Superstorm Sandy ravaged homes and business. ""Much of the iconic boardwalk is buckled and much of the piers are out to sea,"" he said. ""The shore and boardwalk in Seaside Heights of my childhood no longer exists."" ""This is our Katrina,"" the governor added. Still in the dark, frustration mounts in New York neighborhood . To the north, some 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County remained without power. Another 150,000 homes in Long Island and harder-hit areas of Queens, such as Rockaway Peninsula, were also in the dark after the double blow of Sandy and this week's nor'easter. But in an attempt to deal with persistently long gas lines, New York police started enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system on Friday. Drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number could fill up Friday, while those with even numbers or zero can fill up Saturday. ""I think it will make the lines go down,"" Sue Powers of Long Island told CNN affiliate NY1. ""Waiting (in) line here for 8Â½ hours is not fun."" Meanwhile, residents in Long Island who have been without power for 11 days expressed anger at elected officials at a rally Friday, and the politicians deftly redirected the anger at the Long Island Power Authority, charged with restoring power. Local and federal officials who stood to speak before residents in Oceanside, on Long Island, were met with boos and pointed questions about whether they had any power and how comfortable they were. ""What are you doing for us?"" some in the crowd shouted. Braving the boos, Kate Murray, presiding supervisor for the town of Hempstead, suggested residents ask themselves where the utility officials are. ""LIPA is the only entity that can turn on your electricity. Where are they?"" she said. ""They won't talk to us. We call them every day; they won't give us one answer."" Murray seemed to successfully shift the residents' cries against the politicians into chants of ""Where is LIPA? Where is LIPA?"" ""LIPA has absolutely abrogated all of its duties,"" she said. ""They should be wiped off the face of the earth."" No one from the utility was present to address the anger. In a written statement, the company said it has more than 8,200 linemen and tree-trimming crews making progress. ""When possible, we will restore power to customers who have been without power for the longest time,"" the utility said in the statement. ""Your safety and well-being remain our No. 1 priority and we thank you for your continued patience during this difficult time."" U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, tried to reassure residents that all their elected officials were working around the clock on their behalf. ""Everybody is suffering. We have to get through this together, and we will get through this together,"" McCarthy said. Meanwhile, the National Park Service announced the Statue of Liberty, which had been dark since Superstorm Sandy, was to be relit Friday. The National Park Foundation said the statue ""will once again shine as a beacon of hope, a bright testament to the strength and resilience of the United States and the steadfast ability of our citizens to join together and rebuild in the face of adversity."" New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall October 29, put gas rationing rules into effect last week in 12 counties. Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims . Christie told reporters Thursday that the nor'easter, which brought cold and snow to the area, was responsible for 167,000 new outages but praised utility workers who were trying to get the lights and heat back on.

A police officer walks past destroyed cars on the Union University campus in Jackson, Tennessee, Wednesday. The storms ripped apart homes and trapped residents of university dorms and a retirement home in debris. The trail of death stretched across four states, with four people killed in Alabama, 13 in Arkansas, seven in Kentucky and 31 in Tennessee. In some cases, there was almost no warning before the severe weather hit. James Baskin of Jackson, Tennessee, was driving a car when a twister ""just picked us up and threw us,"" he said. Everyone in the car was injured, including his daughter's friend, who suffered a broken collarbone. ""We'll get through it. Nobody's dead. That's the biggest thing,"" Baskin said. The storm system was becoming less intense as it moved east Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said, but the National Weather Service issued tornado and severe storm warnings and said extreme weather still was possible. President Bush said Wednesday he had called the governors of the affected states to offer help and to tell them that ""the American people hold those who suffered up in prayer."" The Federal Emergency Management Agency was deploying teams to the area, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said Wednesday. ""We're going to keep watching this,"" he said.

Classes were canceled at least until February 18, he said. Nine students were hospitalized overnight, but there were no life-threatening injuries, according to university spokesman Tim Elsworth. To the west, a tornado swept through the southeastern section of Memphis in Shelby County. The storms yanked the roof off a hangar at Memphis International Airport, the National Weather Service said. Oaks said one person was killed at the Hickory Ridge Mall in Shelby County.

The blaze could be seen in the night sky for miles around, with flames shooting ""400, 500 feet in the air,"" said Tennessee Emergency Management spokesman Donnie Smith. The station was damaged significantly, but there were no reports of injuries or fatalities, said Columbia spokesman Kelly Merritt. ""We would not have had any employees there [overnight]."" The blaze was put out early Wednesday morning, he said. The tornado cut a wide swath near the facility, flattening the home of Dara Reasonover. ""It just took the house and everything and my horses and my dog,"" a shaken Reasonover said, as the glow of the fire lit the sky behind her. ""I don't know if they're alive or dead, but we'll make it."" In Arkansas, the storm killed 13 people in six counties, the state Emergency Management Agency said. In the city of Atkins, a man, woman and child in the same family were killed, county Judge Jim Ed Gibson told CNN. The storms overturned trucks and other vehicles along Interstate 40, closing the highway briefly, he said. Storms also ripped through Kentucky, killing at least seven people. A state of emergency was declared in Muhlenberg County, and Kentucky National Guard troops were deployed, state emergency spokesman Buddy Rogers said. In Alabama, the storms killed four people, three in Lawrence County and one in Jackson County, officials said. Resident Roger Riddle said that when he heard the tornado siren, he rounded up his children and took them to a community storm shelter. When he emerged, he saw the twister traveling away from them and ""total destruction."" ""We've got things tore up, and the house across the road from us is completely gone,"" Riddle said. In Mississippi, the director of the state's Emergency Management Agency, Mike Womack, estimated that 20 to 30 tornadoes pounded the state in areas above the state capital of Jackson.

""It's hard to put into words how it feels to win again; the team stayed focused and made few mistakes and I would like to thank them for all their impressive efforts. I would also like to thank (engine supplier) Renault who worked so hard all year. ""The history of Formula One means a lot to me and it's special to know that we are now somehow a part of that."" Vettel clinched his first world title in the final race of 2010, the only time last year that he led the standings. But 2011 was a different story as he won the first race in Australia and sealed the championship in Japan with four grands prix to go. He broke Nigel Mansell's record of pole positions by winning his 15th in the final race in Brazil, where teammate Mark Webber notched his only victory. And in India in October, Vettel became the youngest driver to earn pole, win the race, set the fastest lap and lead from start to finish in one grand prix. ""It's phenomenal what the team has achieved this year,"" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said. ""To win 12 races and take 18 pole positions and 27 podiums to defend our title is something we are very proud of. ""I would like to thank every member of the team, including Mark and Sebastian for all their hard work. Receiving the award tonight is fantastic and a great end to what has been an incredible year. ""Seb's achievement of becoming a double Formula One world champion is incredible; the fact he is the youngest ever to do this is testament to the exciting young talent that he is."" World rally champion Sebastian Loeb also received his trophy after winning the title for a record-breaking eighth consecutive time. It put him one clear of Michael Schumacher's record seven F1 crowns, giving him some claim to being motorsport's most successful driver. The Frenchman and co-driver Daniel Elena helped Citroen win a fourth successive manufacturers' crown as he and teammate Sebastian Ogier both won five races out of 13 this year. ""What an incredible season! The battle with the other drivers has been intense from the beginning to the end,"" said Loeb, who clinched the title in the final round . ""After a great start to the season we really had to battle hard again at the end of the year; we lost a lot of our advantage and it was like starting from zero all over again going into the final two rounds."" His compatriot Yvan Muller was officially crowned World Touring Car champion with Chevrolet, who won a second manufacturers' title.",7,7.850201095167016
d8ef4fc8414944e586d5f5aa77556a6a16b91ef0,CNN,"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The Lebanese army has arrested 10 suspected members of a terrorist network who the military believes were planning to attack targets abroad, the army said. The army claims suspects planned to create cells to monitor and attack UNIFIL troops, among other things. Most of the suspects are not from Lebanon, said the army, which does not identify the network in the statement it released. Officials also don't say when or where the suspects were captured. ""As a result of intensive investigation by the Lebanese army intelligence directorate in following up on radical terrorist networks, the directorate was able to arrest ten persons of one of these networks, belonging to different Arab nationalities,"" the statement said. According to a military probe, some of those arrested had used their jobs in private companies as a cover for surveillance and monitoring operations. The army urged private employers to verify the legal status of their employees or job seekers and report any suspicious information. The army claims the terrorists in custody were planning to: . • Smuggle wanted terrorists from the Palestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh, located south of Beirut, to other countries. One of the network's members was to bring them fake documents and money for their trip. • ""Harbor radical elements"" from the terrorist group Fatah al-Islam and give them fake documents to help them enter the Ein el-Hilweh camp. • Create terror cells to monitor the Lebanese army and UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, to carry out attacks against them. • Carry out surveillance of money exchange centers and jewelry stores as possible robbery targets to help finance their operations.",1,7.611936371658458
73413ebbbca088047dd9f8e986affed1b684538a,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Barack Obama's decision to reject roughly $85 million in public financing -- as well as the strict spending limits that would accompany those funds -- did not come as a surprise to most political observers. The decision was criticized by his opponent, some Democrats and public interest groups. But does the public really care? Probably not. The presumptive Democratic nominee has smashed fundraising records this cycle by harnessing the power of the Internet to raise the once unimaginable sum of almost $266 million from more than 1.5 million donors through the end of April. Obama's fundraising machine shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. If anything, it will only pick up the pace now that a whole new pool of donors has been made available with the elimination of Sen. Hillary Clinton from the campaign. Sen. John McCain, on the other hand, has raised $93 million through April. A significant number of unenthusiastic conservatives have so far been unwilling to open their wallets for the presumptive GOP nominee. McCain, in what could turn out to be a tragically ironic twist of fate for his campaign, angered many of the same wealthy Republican donors he now desperately needs by trumpeting the cause of campaign finance reform throughout most of his Senate career. Obama is the first presidential candidate to reject public funding since the creation of the post-Watergate campaign finance system. He all but ensures that he will be able to outspend McCain significantly in every swing state -- in the ground game and on the airwaves -- through November. For his part, Obama argues that he opted out of public funding because ""the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system."" Tapping into a fear among many Democrats who still angrily remember the ""swift boat"" attacks against Sen. John Kerry in 2004, Obama says, ""We've already seen that [the McCain campaign is] not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations."" McCain's advisers, not surprisingly, have a different take on Obama's decision. They argue that Obama failed to abide by his pledge, as stated in a response to a questionnaire from the Midwest Democracy Network in November, to ""aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""  Watch McCain blast Obama's decision » . ""The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people,"" said Jill Hazelbaker, McCain's communications director. ""Barack Obama has failed that test, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics."" Some Democrats and public interest groups were also critical. ""This is not a good decision,"" said Sen. Russ Feingold, co-author of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. ""While the current public financing system for the presidential primaries is broken, the system for the general election is not. The entire system must be updated."" Common Cause issued a statement noting that ""Sen. Obama did say at one point that he would opt into the system if his opponent did the same, and for that he gets a demerit."" Most polling on the issue indicates that a majority of voters are not fond of the idea of bankrolling presidential campaigns. In an August 2007 Gallup Poll, 57 percent of respondents said that federal financing of presidential candidates was unacceptable, while 41 percent agreed with the idea. A larger share of voters (47 percent) said it was more acceptable for candidates to raise money for their campaigns from much-maligned political action committees. Ninety-three percent had no problem with individual contributions made by ordinary citizens. ""For years now, polls have suggested that many Americans don't see the point in giving tax dollars directly to politicians,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""That's why public financing of campaigns has not been wildly popular, as shown by the relatively low number of taxpayers who use the checkoff box on their tax forms to allocate money to the system that Obama has opted out of."" Indeed, since public financing of general elections first came into effect for the 1976 campaign, the percentage of taxpayers choosing to contribute to the presidential election fund has steadily declined. In 1976, almost 28 percent of taxpayers contributed to the fund. In 2006, slightly less than 11 percent agreed to steer $3 of their taxes to the fund. If Obama's campaign is hurt at all by this decision, that damage may result more from a public perception of hypocrisy than from any consternation over a rejection of taxpayer dollars. The McCain campaign has seemed to acknowledge so by criticizing Obama for flip-flopping on the issue instead of trying to defend the merits of public funding. Moving forward, McCain said Thursday that he will take public financing this fall. The senator from Arizona may be trying to make a virtue out of necessity. Unable to compete with Obama's fundraising prowess, McCain may try to claim the moral high ground by portraying himself as a straight-talking underdog, while simultaneously painting Obama as an untrustworthy adversary. Obama likely will continue to defend his decision by criticizing McCain for failing to rein in the Republican-leaning organizations such as those that launched such damaging attacks against Kerry. At the same time, securing an overwhelming financial advantage in the final months of the 2008 campaign in exchange for a small slap on the wrist from groups such as Common Cause isn't such a bad tradeoff. As the old saying goes, money probably will always be the mother's milk of politics.",3,5.470977971566958
e110f5feabdf0e2f0721e9599e78ca3675bae577,CNN,"(CNN) -- When the comedian Daniel Tosh reportedly singled out a woman in his audience and suggested, according to a blog post that recounted the incident, it would be ""funny"" if she ""got raped by, like, five guys, right now,"" the online reaction was swift, heated and often split down gender lines. Many men wanted to explain free speech or heckling etiquette. Many women (and virtually all feminists) said these topics were distractions, at best, from the sheer offensiveness of Tosh's attack. As we at the Women's Media Center watched hundreds of users comment on our Facebook post about the incident, we saw the same disconnect. Quite a few of the women who shared our post said they were doing so in hopes that a husband or boyfriend would ""finally understand why I won't watch Tosh's show with him."" Some even tagged their husbands or boyfriends, to be sure the message would reach its destination. In the aggregate, these comments gave us a glimpse into the ongoing, low-grade conflicts between women who have been trying to articulate their discomfort with Tosh's lazy, cruel and misogynistic humor, and the men who share their lives but just don't get it. At the center of these disagreements is the rape-joke empathy gap. The problem isn't a failure of men to see rape as horrific. It's that many of them do not perceive that rape itself lies on the far end of a broad spectrum of ways in which the idea of rape, the invocation of rape or the threat of rape is used to intimidate women or to regulate their behavior. When women are told that they shouldn't drink too much or walk alone at night or wear a revealing top, they are being given a guided tour of the boundaries of acceptable female conduct. Women are supposed to understand that these boundaries are policed by rapists. We cross the line at our own risk. And if we are caught, the brutal punishment is one we have earned. Gilbert Gottfried: If you don't want to hear an edgy joke, don't listen . A comedian who shoots down an audience member who objects to his rape jokes by joking about her being gang-raped on the spot isn't being funny. He's using rape to shut up a woman who crossed a boundary by speaking out of turn. That is unacceptable. Tosh was free to say what he said, of course. But that doesn't mean it wasn't morally repugnant. It was. What about rape jokes with less vicious punch lines? Here is the gray area where the empathy gap thrives best. There is absolutely room in both comedy and in feminism for discussions about rape jokes that highlight rape as a social ill vs. those that perpetuate that injustice. That's why we joined with other feminist media critics and activists to produce a YouTube ""supercut"" of rape jokes -- some insightful and some far less so. Still, the presence of rape in women's lives is too real and pervasive for many to laugh at all the same jokes that many men can. It's not that women never enjoy crude humor -- a lesbian journalist friend recently confided in us her amazement that her wife is a fan of Tosh's show, if not some of its more brutal misogyny. And it's not that no man knows with terrible certainty what it's like to be a rape victim -- one in five females and one in 71 males in the United States are the victims of rape, to say nothing of atrocities around the world such as those described in our new report on rape as a weapon of war in Syria. Nonetheless, the significant overlap between the gender divide and the rape-joke empathy gap is real, and it seems inevitable when media coverage of rape so often focuses on what a victim should have done differently to try harder not to get raped. Such shoddy framing creates a fictional image that there's a certain type of woman who gets raped. Women know that's a lie, because they live the truth, but men may never have occasion to question that image, and so when they laugh at rape jokes, they're laughing at an abstraction that's all too real for many women. Tosh and all those with the privilege to hold a microphone have a responsibility to shine a light on the reality behind the abstraction -- not to perpetuate it, and certainly not to silence those who bear its burden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Burton and Michelle Kinsey Bruns.",4,10.365483785952268
551f3d88d05567e87b91bd9b222335605867604f,CNN,"(CNN) -- The last eight years In the United States have included momentous events including the September 11 attacks, the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and an economic recession. Ted Stanke of New York created a symbolic map of the United States out of toy soldiers to protest the Iraq war. Historic moments defined President Bush's time in office, and now the world must wait to see how history will define him. Just 27 percent of the respondents to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll said they approved of Bush's handling of his job as president. Respondents also indicated they didn't want him to have future influence, with 66 percent saying they didn't want to see the president return to public life. We asked readers to share their views on Bush's legacy on iReport.com. The majority of the responses expressed disappointment with the president's performance. Many readers with whom we spoke said they were deeply frustrated with the way Bush handled issues such as the Iraq war, the economy and Hurricane Katrina.  Watch Bush discuss handling of Katrina » . Cathy Cott, 49, of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, vented her ""boiling anger"" on iReport.com. She voted Republican for 22 years until after the 2000 election when Bush won a narrow victory over Democrat Al Gore. She says she is now a registered Democrat who voted for Barack Obama. iReport.com: Bubbling over . ""I guess the simplest reason for my boiling anger is I have three kids and they will spend their lives paying for Bush's policies, wars, economic disasters and the general mess he is leaving behind both monetarily and in their general quality of life,"" Cott said. ""Eight years of frustration"" over the Iraq war and other military decisions inspired New York artist Ted Stanke to create painstakingly detailed and unmistakably symbolic artwork from toy soldiers. One piece shows a map of the United States with an inset globe made from the tiny fighters, while another depicts a bush constructed from the soldiers. iReport.com: See Stanke's toy soldier art . Some iReporters say they still support Bush, while others said they voted for him but changed their minds about him later. Kathi Cordsen is a Republican who describes herself as a Bush supporter. The Fullerton, California, resident says the September 11 attacks profoundly changed the way people perceived Bush. She says many people were too unwilling to give him a chance. iReport.com: In defense of Bush . ""He is a funny man, a kind man, a bit of a goofball and not very well-spoken,"" Cordsen said. ""But, he would not have been treated the way he is being treated now if not for 9/11. His presidency was thwarted by the 'evildoers.' I love that term of his."" Chuck Burkhard of Windber, Pennsylvania, hopes history will remember Bush as a strong man who loved his country. Burkard said the president juggled unprecedented challenges during his term, including dealing with terrorism and facing up to financial forces that may not have been under his control. Critics of Bush should look within themselves for answers, he said. iReport.com: Working overtime . ""Most of us are spoiled by a have-it-our-way-now and reckless generation that must stop borrowing so much and start working more. We shift blame instead of looking to ourselves for resolve and drive."" Burkhard said he feels Bush is one of the most overworked presidents in history and has shouldered too much blame for the current state of the economy. ""I personally have never seen this much responsibility thrown onto our country, in such a small amount of time,"" Burkhard said. ""We are responsible for the world economy, the global war on terror, global warming. You name it, we have our hands in it."" Chris Molisani of Rochester, New York, says September 11 was a defining moment, not just for Bush's presidency, but also in his own life. He was in high school and college during Bush's eight years in the White House. iReport.com: Look back on how Bush changed the country . He can scarcely remember the Bush presidency before 9/11 and expects phrases such as ""weapons of mass destruction,"" ""Axis of Evil"" and ""You're either with us or against us"" to be associated permanently with him. He hopes for a brighter future with President-elect Barack Obama. ""History will likely be kinder to Bush than his contemporaries are, but a Washington, Lincoln or Roosevelt he will not become,"" Molisani said. ""What is interesting to note is that some of the worst presidents in history have been followed by the best presidents. Perhaps we will have a bright future to look forward to."" Maria Davis of Prescott Valley, Arizona, voted twice for Bush but now regrets her decision. Her dislike for the Democratic candidates' running mates in 2000 and 2004 was a major factor, she said.  iReport.com: Watch Davis discuss the pros and cons of the president's time . Although she wants Bush to get out of the national spotlight, she feels he needs to speak to the people and mend wounds. She hopes he will follow Sen. John McCain's example and make a gracious speech after the inauguration. ""Speak to the American people passionately and gracefully about Obama taking the presidency,"" Davis said. ""That would probably help people."" His presidency wasn't all bad, she said. ""Well, he was good for 9/11, and he caught Saddam [Hussein], but he ran the country into the ground with unneeded funding for an unneeded war in Iraq,"" she wrote. Overall, Davis has mixed feelings now and has felt uneasy for a long time. She was laid off from her job and is trying to run a home eBay business that barely pays rent. She is having trouble finding jobs that pay more than $7 per hour. Her brother, who has a house payment and a child to support, was recently laid off, as well. She hopes the country can rebuild. ""It's hell, it's absolutely hell,"" she said. ""I really hope Obama can fix the economy so we can have our lives again and live the American dream."" The desire to dream again was a common theme, and many iReporters said they yearn for more hopeful times. Robin Savage of San Juan Capistrano, California, said Bush's greatest legacy is the passionate voter turnout he unintentionally inspired in the 2008 election. She said she is glad to see Obama's rise as a result. iReport.com: One last thing before he goes . ""I think the one thing President Bush will be remembered for is not being able to really connect with people. If you compared him to Obama, I tell you, what a difference there is."" Patrick Finney of Portland, Oregon, said he felt there was a large disconnect between Bush and the American people. He says the president ignored what ordinary folks wanted. ""I am afraid that George Bush will be judged harshly by history,"" Finney said. ""I am also afraid that judgment will be deserved."" But critics should be careful about taking aim at Bush, warns David P. Kronmiller of Burbank, California. ""I do not think we should be blaming him for the misery of the last eight years. He is not to blame. We are. You are, the American people. We voted him into office."" iReport.com: The Bush paradox . Kronmiller says he voted for Bush in 2000, but not in 2004, adding that he feels Bush is responsible for day-to-day decisions that placed the country in a state he finds unfortunate. He watched the final presidential news conference and said he thinks Bush should have better addressed the hardships faced by residents who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. ""I learned my lesson in four years,"" Kronmiller says. Jimmy Deol of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said he believes Bush had good intentions. ""I think he meant well,"" Deol said. ""I wholeheartedly believe it. In his convictions, he always thought he was doing the right thing. The people elected him. There must have been something people liked."" iReport.com: Quotes and commentary . Deol said he thinks Bush should take time out to help the veterans of the war he helped create. Overall, he said, the meaning of the Bush presidency will be defined by those who pick up where he left off. ""The movement of change? That's Bush's legacy.""",3,8.631514973777128
a5ea463f4bff16f4c063a6a677345eb3b222bf60,CNN,"(CNN)Presumed dead by some, the actual fate of the aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains unconfirmed because of the secretive nature of that country. Last year, a North Korean defector said that Kim Kyung Hee had died from a stroke while arguing on the phone with the North Korean leader about her husband's execution. The defector's claims were widely reported, but doubts have persisted. Lawmakers in neighboring South Korea told the news agency Yonhap Tuesday that the country's National Intelligence Service reported there is no evidence that Kim Kyung Hee died. It is believed that she is still alive, a South Korean government source told CNN. CNN could not verify claims of Kim Kyung Hee's fate. Kim Kyung Hee is the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died a little more than three years ago and left his son in power. Her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December 2013, shocking many observers around the world. Before his execution, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion, having him executed on charges that he tried to overthrow the government.

d79b790edcc3f5088161445102a656ae4adb8ab1,CNN,"(CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet . On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""This is not a piece of cake,"" he told CNN, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, ""there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money."" But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY FIGURES . Orders . Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers .

f92b1a3d1c4ca86a4585260db0dfc1acb8cf44d7,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Debates are a campaign's restart button. Voters try to erase their preconceptions and examine the candidates face-to-face, equal and unscripted -- which is why a challenger, particularly one who's running behind, is eager to have as many debates as possible. Voters said John Kerry won the debates in 2004 but they liked George W. Bush better and he won a second term. ""Let's meet every week from now until the election and talk about the real issues facing Americans.'' That was John Kerry to U.S. President George W. Bush in August 2004. Republican John McCain issued the same challenge to Democratic Barack Obama this summer, when Obama was the frontrunner in the polls. This year there's three debates between the presidential candidates -- September 26 in Mississippi; October 7 in Tennessee and October 15 in New York state. Debates are valuable because they provide most of the spontaneous moments in the campaign. Everything else is staged -- the rallies, the television ads, the conventions. But debates, which are organized by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, are unscripted. The candidates do not know the questions in advance. How do they prepare? Debate coaches grill them. They ask them tough questions on every subject likely to come up. They even coach the candidates on ""body language,'' such as how to invade an opponent's space in order to appear dominant.  Watch a preview of the upcoming presidential debate » . In every election since 1952 -- until this year -- either the president has run for re-election (like George W. Bush in 2004) or the vice president has run to succeed him (like Al Gore in 2000). Debates give the challenger a chance to close the stature gap with the president or the vice president. And to make the election a referendum on the incumbent president. In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was challenging Vice President Richard Nixon, played to concerns that the U.S. was losing its competitive edge against the Soviet Union. ""Are our strength and prestige rising?"" Kennedy asked in a debate. ""Do people want to be identified with us?"" The 1980 race was very much in doubt when challenger Ronald Reagan went into his one and only debate with President Jimmy Carter one week before Election Day. Reagan's hard-line image frightened many voters. He used the debate to reassure them that he wasn't a dangerous man. And to frame the election as a referendum on his opponent. ""Ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?'' Reagan said in his closing statement. ""Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?'' Debates often provide revealing moments. Like when President Gerald Ford prematurely liberated Eastern Europe at a 1976 debate. ""The United States does not concede that these countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union,'' the president said, making specific reference to Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania. In 1988, Michael Dukakis gave a dispassionate response when asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. ""I've opposed the death penalty all of my life,'' Dukakis replied. ""I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent.'' In 1992, the first President Bush was criticized for being out of touch with ordinary Americans. That perception was reinforced during a debate when the camera caught the president looking at his watch as he took questions from voters. One voter asked about the consequences of the national debt. ""I'm not sure I get it,'' President Bush responded. The challenger got it. ""Tell me how [the debt] has affected you?'' Bill Clinton responded. ""Do you know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?'' In 2000, Al Gore may have won more debating points. But the camera caught Gore theatrically sighing while George W. Bush answered questions. Voters liked Bush better. And that's what counted. Similarly in 2004, when CNN polled viewers after each debate, the prevailing view was that Kerry won. Voters concluded Kerry was a better debater than Bush. But that didn't get Kerry many votes. Voters decide how to vote based on many qualities, not just debating skills. The prize for winning a debate is not winning the election. What debates really do is keep the race open. Many voters say: ""I'm going to hit the restart button, clear the screen and watch the debates with an open mind. Then I'll decide how to vote.''",3,5.6168056492996055
719a6d64a3f24a9e03656aefdcd4366603d3c9e9,CNN,"(CNN) -- Only a few hours had passed after the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds, when this little nugget of inspiration showed up in my Twitter feed: . ""Back home. You know what? I'm going for a run. Definitely."" That tweet is from Peter Vigneron, a writer who was at the marathon when the bombs went off. Luckily, as he writes on his blog, he was far enough from the blasts to be safe. As the hours went by I started to see more online posts like that -- runners in Boston and elsewhere making pledges to lace up their sneakers and hit the road. It felt like a groundswell of grass-roots action, a collective statement that this tragedy, no matter who perpetrated it or why, wasn't going to stop people from doing what they love. iReport: Run for Boston 2014 . By Tuesday, people from Hong Kong, India, Canada, England, Croatia, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and the Netherlands were using the hashtag #runforboston and a Google doc created by CNN iReporter Becca Obergefell to log their journeys. The momentum has been building. As of early Tuesday afternoon, 360 people had logged more than 1,200 running miles on Obergefell's page. People also have been sharing their stories with her. ""I ran to clear my head, but it didn't work. So I ran because I could. Because the freedom of running wasn't taken away from me. Because the running community stretches to all cities and all places, and I'm glad to be a part of it,"" one person wrote to Obergefell, a 26-year-old in Columbus, Ohio. I heard these stories and got inspired. That's why I'm pledging to run a marathon in honor of Boston -- and, since I'm kind of a couch potato, I'm going to pledge to do it by April 15, 2014, the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy. I'd like to invite you to do the same. Sign up by going to the ""Run for Boston 2014"" page on CNN iReport and uploading a photo of you and your running shoes. Alternatively, post the photo to Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #runforboston and #cnnireport. If you're so inclined, tell us why you're running. You don't have to pledge to run a marathon. Run a mile or a 5K -- or do a walk. The important thing is to get out there and get moving. Do it for Boston. Do it for your health. Or, if you use the simple app called Charity Miles, you can do it to raise money for one of the several worthy charities it features. I'm doing it because I feel like I've got to do something. It's been 12 years since 9/11 and 18 years since the Oklahoma City bombing. I was safely miles away, in a middle school classroom, when a bomb exploded in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168. But that morning is stuck in my memory forever. I'm running because I don't want any of these tragedies to change me or to change us as a people -- to make us afraid, to keep us indoors. I am by no means a regular runner -- or even a runner at all. One of my friends saw a post about this idea on Facebook and thought I was joking. So please don't feel shy about signing up to do something new. I have no idea what I'm getting myself into -- and I think that's probably a good thing, at least for now. CNN also hopes to make a video about the collective journey -- and I'm running to see what it will be like to (hopefully) complete this challenge as a group. I could go on, but instead I'm going to go take a photo with my sneakers. And then hit the sidewalk. I hope you'll do the same. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D.

35ac28f53c32fd9c968963d4ef2de5a46a7b932c,CNN,"(CNN) -- When United recently announced that it would install inflight Internet on all its mainline aircraft beginning next year, it might not have seemed like a big deal. After all, airlines have had Internet on board for a couple of years now and it has become quite common. This, however, is different. This is the first effort by a U.S. airline to provide Internet on intercontinental flights. You might recognize AirTran, Alaska, American, Delta and Virgin America as airlines that have been aggressively installing Internet aboard their aircraft over the last few years. Those airlines, however, are constrained by geography because of the system they use. All those carriers contract with Gogo to be their Internet provider, and Gogo transmits its signals from the ground: It has stations all over the United States that allow aircraft to connect to the Internet. But these aren't installed in the water, so fairly soon after you go ""feet wet"" on your flight, the Internet stops working. Airlines like this system because it's easy to install (it can be done overnight on an airplane), the system is relatively inexpensive and the bandwidth is cheap. That makes for a winning combination, but it does have constraints. That's why United is going a different route. United is installing satellite-based Internet on its airplanes. As long as the aircraft is in range of the satellite, then Internet can flow freely. United is far from the first airline to do this. In fact, Southwest has been installing satellite Internet for a while now as well, but there is one big issue. The problem with satellite-based Internet in general is that it's more expensive. You would expect that to be the case -- satellites don't come cheap. There are also considerations about the amount of weight added to the aircraft from the antenna, the cost and the amount of time it takes to do an install (longer than the overnight required by Gogo). Boeing's luxury offices in the sky . Airlines have been hesitant to sink a lot of money into something that, so far, hasn't seen much usage. Though reports are spotty, most airlines have hinted at single-digit percentage usage on aircraft. Some see more, like Virgin America and its more tech-savvy demographic, but in general, it's not a lot. United, however, is making a bet that it will catch on in greater numbers and it will be an important amenity. How much will it cost you, the traveler? We don't know, because United hasn't said anything. But we can look at its partner airline Lufthansa to get an idea of how other long-haul airlines are pricing the same system. When you fly Lufthansa today, you can pay â‚¬10.95 for one hour (about $15) or â‚¬19.95 for 24 hours (about $27). United will certainly come up with its own pricing, but this gives you a sense of what you're looking at. Five extraordinary airport lounges . Now that United has made the move, we have to wait and see if others will follow. A Delta spokesperson says the airline is ""reviewing international connectivity options for our customers but (we) don't have further details at this time."" It might not actually be United's move that pushes others to offer long-haul Internet but rather technological advances. Last month, a new satellite was launched into space, and it will provide faster, cheaper Internet. (It uses a different technology than the service United has signed up with for its long-haul flights). JetBlue subsidiary LiveTV has been offering this option, and JetBlue itself will begin installing it on its fleet next year. Will Delta and American eventually fall in line and put Internet on their long haul fleets? I would imagine so, but when it happens and with what technology still remains to be seen.",4,10.722440310327112
58899c375f0887527e91d9728631595dac77b55f,CNN,"(CNN) -- At least four people were killed and dozens more were injured on Saturday when security forces in the restive Syrian city of Homs Saturday greeted anguished mourners with brute force, an activist told CNN. The latest confrontation rattled a country on edge after at least 44 people died in Homs and other cities Friday when Syrian security personnel fired at demonstrators, according to the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. The violence erupted after as tens of thousands of people marched in a funeral procession and went to a graveyard to bury some of the Friday's victims, the activist said. The assault began after mourners were filing out of the cemetery, the activist said. ""We were chanting and praying for the martyrs and they just sprayed us with their bullets. I saw seven to eight people on the ground bleeding and moaning. I ran as fast as I could as bullets flew past us towards the fields and hid among the olive trees until another mourner saw me and helped me walk to the main road,"" the activist said. ""From there I ran to my apartment to see my wife and children. We live very close to the graveyard and I can still hear the sound of heavy gunfire coming from the area."" Security forces earlier used force against 300 demonstrators in Homs who were demanding the right of mourners to march through the city center. But security forces forcefully put down the turnout in about 30 minutes, and many of the demonstrators were arrested. Later Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered for the funeral procession on the outskirts of the city to bury eight victims of the Friday demonstrations, and it appeared the event would remain peaceful. The miles-long funeral procession defiantly passed by army stations and several tanks, but the marchers were greeted kindly by soldiers to which the crowd responded by chanting, ""The people and the army are one hand."" However, violence erupted as security forces stepped in, the activist said. Mourners quickly dispersed some into the graveyards and surrounding fields, and gunfire could be heard. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts. The deaths occurred after demonstrations broke out after Friday prayers in Syrian cities, as they have for weeks. Every week, the demonstrations have particular themes. May 20 was Azadi Friday in honor of the Syrian Kurdish protesters. Azadi means ""freedom"" in Kurdish. A military source quoted by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said at least 17 civilians and security personnel were killed on Friday by the unidentified ""armed groups"" the government has been blaming for the discord. For two months, Syria has been torn by street protests against political repression and a fierce security crackdown against demonstrators. The government's fierce actions toward marchers and its thousands of mass arrests have drawn widespread criticism. Around 830 people have been killed in protests, according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link. That number does not include security personnel, many of whom have been killed in attacks by ""armed groups,"" according to the Syrian government. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other senior officials. On Thursday, President Barack Obama singled out Syria for criticism during his speech on the Middle East. The clashes have spurred people to flee to other countries, such as Turkey and Lebanon. Seven injured Syrians and four others people crossed the border into Turkey and were brought to Antakya state hospital Friday night, according to a doctor and the Hatay province governor quoted by Turkey's state-run Anatolian Agency. The doctor at the Antakya State Hospital said the patients were between the ages of 25 and 40 and the injuries stemmed from gunshots. One patient was in intensive care and some of them had injuries on their feet. Another patient who was shot on the eye, was transferred to the university hospital in Hatay. About 250 Syrians fled to Turkey end of April, mostly from Latakia, on the western coast of Syria. They have been living in a tent camp set up by the Turkish Red Crescent for them in the border town of Yayladagi since then. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and al-Assad developed close ties between Turkey and Syria in recent years. Turkey lifted visa restrictions on Syrian visitors last year. But escalating violence in Syria is increasing worries of the Turkish government which has been advocating a ""zero problems"" foreign policy with its neighbors. The U.N. refugee agency on Friday said it is helping serve the thousands of Syrians who ""escaped to the border areas of Wadi Khaled and Tall Bire in northern Lebanon. "" ""Local leaders say some 1,400 people have crossed into these two regions over the past week from Tall Kalakh in Syria. ""This is in addition to those that have crossed since late April. Local authorities estimate that around 4,000 Syrians have crossed to Lebanon recently,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said many have found refuge with host families or relatives and some have taken shelter in a school. The Human Rights Watch on Friday said locally elected officials are estimating that 3,500 Syrians ""are currently present"" in the Wadi Khaled area. But it criticized Lebanon's security forces for detaining Syrian refugees in some instances. It said nine Syrian men and a child have been detained since Sunday. The relatives and friends of these people said they fled to Lebanon because they were afraid Syrian forces would arrest or shoot them. ""Lebanese authorities should instead provide them with at least temporary asylum, and above all refrain from deporting them back to Syria,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""Syria welcomed many Lebanese fleeing war back in 2006,"" said Nadim Houry, Beirut director at Human Rights Watch. ""Now it's time to return the favor. Lebanon should be offering immediate refuge to Syrians fleeing death or torture in their country.""

Mayor Cheye Calvo of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor during the July 29 raid, which police said was part of an investigation into a scheme in which drugs apparently were sent to unsuspecting people. Prince George's County police, who were in charge of the raid, issued a statement Friday clearing the couple of involvement and expressing ""regret."" The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland are investigating the incident, FBI spokesman Richard Wolf said Friday. Calvo had asked for the federal investigation. ""We lost our family dogs,"" he said Thursday. ""We did it at the hands of sheriff's deputies who burst through our front door, rifles blazing.""  Watch the mayor's description of the raid » . According to The Associated Press, two men, including a FedEx deliveryman, have been arrested in the case. Police said the scheme involved shipping drugs to unsuspecting people's homes and intercepting the packages. About $3.6 million in marijuana had been seized, police told the AP. In this instance, investigators told the AP, a package containing 32 pounds of marijuana was sent from Los Angeles, California, to Calvo's house in Berwyn Heights, a town of 3,000 residents 10 miles from Washington. The package was addressed to his Calvo's wife, Trinity Tomsic. In transit, a drug-sniffing dog in Arizona brought attention to the package, investigators told the AP. Police intercepted it when it arrived in Maryland, and it was delivered to the Calvo home by an undercover officer, according to the AP report. In a statement released Friday, Prince George's County Police Chief Melvin High said he called Calvo on Thursday to tell him that in screening the case with the state's attorney's office, ""it was concluded that Ms. Tomsic and the Calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers."" ""I called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the family's beloved dogs,"" High said in the statement. A thorough review of the raid is being conducted, which is standard procedure in such cases, the department said. The Prince George's County Police Department was in charge of the raid, and the sheriff's special operations team was assisting.  Watch the sheriff defend the drug raid » . Calvo said he set the package aside after it arrived at his home and didn't open it. He said he was changing clothes and preparing to attend a community meeting when ""the door flew open. I heard gunfire shoot off. There was a brief pause and more gunfire."" He said he was brought downstairs at gunpoint while in his boxer shorts, handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor along with his mother-in-law. Then, he said, ""I noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood."" While he was being held, Calvo said, he told the police he is the town's mayor, but they didn't believe him. ""They told a detective I was crazy,"" he said. Berwyn Heights has a police force, he said, but Prince George's County police did not notify the municipal authorities of their interest in his home or in the package.

But these are not your normal baby pictures. The Chinese government is trying to find the parents of these 60 homeless children, some of them so young that they had not yet developed the strength to hold their own heads up. This week the Chinese Ministry of Public Security posted pictures of these rescued children on its Web site. Many of them had similar stories. They were kidnapped, stolen or sold and somehow had been rescued by authorities. Police tried to find their parents but could not find them through the national DNA database, state-run China Daily reported. And for the first time, the Ministry of Public Security posted their pictures. ""Even if I can't find my boy's photo on the Web site today, it's a blessing for desperate parents like us who have nearly lost hope,"" Tang Weihua, a mother who lost her 5-year-old son in 1999, told China Daily this week. About 30,000 to 60,000 children are reported missing every year, but it is hard to estimate how many are involved in child trafficking cases, the Ministry of Public Security told China Daily. Police have rescued 2,000 children this year since China launch a nationwide anti-trafficking campaign, China Daily reported. But after rescuing the children finding the parents can prove difficult. One issue is that in some cases the parents sold the children. Earlier this week China's state media reported that police arrested dozens in an alleged child trafficking ring that sold at least 52 babies. The traffickers bought 19 boys and 33 girls from impoverished rural families in Shanxi and Hebei provinces in the past two years, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The ring started crumbling after three men were arrested with a baby boy in their van, Xinhua said. The three suspects said they had bought the baby from a woman and her daughter in Hebei, according to Xinhua. The women had sold 12 other babies to the men, and were arrested, Xinhua said.",1,8.355902563656594

5e4be8623379f97d33a48fed34ddc4440b402dd5,CNN,"(CNN) -- A driver's best bet is to stay home when wintry weather coats the roads in snow and ice, particularly in areas such as the Southeast where motorists and road crews aren't in the habit of dealing with icy conditions. The Georgia Department of Transportation is urging travelers to avoid all but absolutely necessary driving until at least Tuesday as a storm that arrived Sunday night continues to cause treacherous traveling. For those who must go out, it's important to plan ahead. AAA recommends motorists pack a winter driving kit made up of the following: a bag of abrasive material (sand, salt or cat litter), a snow shovel and brush, traction mats, an ice scraper, booster cables, a flashlight, window washing liquid, cloth, warning flares or triangles, a cell phone, gloves and a blanket. Try to ease your vehicle out of parking spaces without spinning the wheels. Drive back and forth for several feet in either direction to clear a path. Spread sand or salt near the wheels if additional traction is needed. If you do get stuck, you can contact AAA via phone, iPhone app or at AAA.com. De-ice vehicles before driving, urges the Mississippi Department of Transportation. Iced-over vehicles can limit driver visibility, and ice flying off cars can be hazardous to fellow drivers. If you have to drive in conditions with low visibility, go slowly, with your headlights on low beam, AAA advises. Allow at least double the usual following distance between cars. Never use cruise control on a slick surface. Steering around an obstruction is often safer than braking suddenly at speeds above 25 mph on a slippery surface, according to AAA's pamphlet ""How to Go on Ice and Snow"" (PDF). When you do brake, don't remove your foot from the brake or pump the pedal if you have antilock brakes, AAA advises. Drivers of cars that don't have antilock brakes should keep their heel on the floor and apply firm pressure to the brake pedal to the threshold of locking. In case of skidding, steer in the direction you want the front of the car to go, keeping your eyes on your travel path. And don't slam on the brakes; you're likely to make it harder to get back in control.",2,11.379076141324248

315186b16891c90c65d00b6b2f42bd010fd0aec6,CNN,"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)The Indonesian military said Tuesday that it was stopping its efforts to recover the remains of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 almost a month after the commercial jet crashed into the sea. Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Basarnas, will continue its work to try to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site in the Java Sea, the head of the agency, Bambang Soelistyo, said Wednesday. The military provided the majority of personnel and hardware involved in the recovery operation, which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems. ""We are really disappointed,"" Imam Sampurno, whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found, said of the military's announcement. ""We really hope the evacuation process is still going."" Basarnas said it would have 60 divers, eight salvage experts, seven boats, two helicopters and a fixed-wing plane taking part in the continued search efforts, which will resume Saturday after the teams take a rest. Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board. So far, searchers have managed to recover 70 bodies from the sea, leaving 92 still unaccounted for. Over the weekend, navy divers tried to lift part of the fuselage of the plane using wire ropes and giant balloons. But the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke. An effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful, the military said. ""Our main priority is to find the bodies. We are not going to focus on lifting the fuselage,"" Soelistyo said Wednesday about the future search plans. The chief of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Moeldoko, on Tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out, said military spokesman Manahan Simorangkir. Officials said that 19 of the 81 navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with decompression sickness and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in Jakarta, the capital. ""I told them safety first. But as we know, soldiers, they are always working hard to find the bodies,"" said Rear Adm. Widodo, commander of the Indonesian Navy's western fleet. ""They are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty."" The divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage, Widodo said. Officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage. But Widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the seafloor. Searchers have recovered at least 14 bodies from the fuselage site, including some that floated free during attempts to lift the wreckage, according to officials. Indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why Flight QZ8501 went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely. Investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight augmentation computers (FACs) played a role in what went wrong, the news agency Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. The FAC helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft, keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure adjustments to the rudder are smooth. It also warns pilots if they try to manually push the plane beyond its capabilities. Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200, had two FACs, one serving as a backup. Indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water. The reason for the sharp ascent is unclear, but aviation analysts say the FAC could have recognized trouble and, at a critical moment, automatically shifted full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis. Investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash, officials said Tuesday. But authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan told CNN on Monday that the final report into the disaster should be published in less than a year. ""It won't be a year, that's my promise,"" he said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff reported from Jakarta, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

ee1fda5151efc05c355b6b6eb0f0cb7ea643ef20,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The looming decision on Syria is likely to preoccupy Congress for the next couple of weeks and complicate President Barack Obama's domestic agenda. Obama's push for military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime over alleged chemical weapons use could push aside his top priorities on immigration and health care. Because he decided to seek congressional approval and now faces strident opposition from many lawmakers and the public to his idea, Obama is having to go all-in in his sales job. His vigorous public relations campaign is all-consuming -- precious time that could have been used guiding an immigration bill through the House and informing the public about a new program to obtain health insurance under Obamacare. Need vs. want . In the world of need and want, though, immigration falls under the ""want"" category. The House scheduled only nine days of work this month. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said a vote on the Syria resolution might not come until next week, the second and last week the House is in session this month. What about October or November? Good question. The House has other pressing matters to address -- issues that have deadlines. The new fiscal year begins October 1 and that's wrapped up in a whole host of difficult topics, including the forced federal budget cuts that went into effect this year (and will have an even greater impact on defense and domestic programs next year). If Syria takes up a good portion of the House's work period in September and it doesn't get to work on government spending, two things could happen: The government shuts down or Congress could pass a short-term spending bill to keep it running for a limited amount of time. House Speaker John Boehner has indicated he will propose a spending bill to keep the government open until December, pushing the contentious but mandatory debate to later this year. Government funding is not the only complication to immigration. The nation's debt limit -- or its ability to borrow money to pay its bills --- will need to be raised by Congress sometime in ""mid-October,"" according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. He said that's when the United States will hit its $16.7 trillion borrowing limit and be unable to meet its credit obligations. Both raising the debt limit and passing mandatory government spending bills are common duties of Congress that have been fraught with crippling partisanship in recent years. Republicans have indicated this time will be no different. They plan to force the president's hand on either one or both issues to force additional spending cuts or defund the president's health care law. In other words, in addition to Syria, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. The immigration bill could be ""dealt a pretty serious blow,"" congressional scholar Norman Ornstein with the American Enterprise Institute said. A crowded megaphone . Now that he has to sell a war-weary public about an intervention in Syria, his rollout of a massive public relations campaign on Obamacare could suffer. The success of public outreach on health care is vital for the law to work. As people can start signing up for the health insurance program on October 1, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one-third of the country, and 43% of the uninsured have heard ""nothing at all"" about the public health care option. If people don't know about it, people won't sign up for the public exchanges. A detrimental factor for the law as participation is critical for viability of the law. Obama announced that he will address the nation on Syria on Tuesday night. Also on Tuesday, the president is personally lobbying members of Congress on Capitol Hill on the resolution to authorize a limited military strike. While the president turns his full attention to Syria and the vote in Congress, previously scheduled items are falling by the wayside. Obama canceled a speech to the annual AFL-CIO conference in California, an opportunity to discuss domestic issues, including health care. The president's complete focus on Syria not only means he will have fewer opportunities to talk to the public about domestic priorities, but the media is focused on the drama building in Congress, too, drowning out any coverage of health care. A cursory search for news stories on the health care law shows a paltry 50 articles. (That's bad news for the president because the articles contained good news for the health care law. A report found that premiums for the government-sponsored exchanges would be much more affordable than expected.) Comparatively, a simple Internet search for news articles on Syria resulted in more than 2,000 news stories. ""There's only a certain amount of bandwidth of issues that can be discussed on TV or voters will be talking about,"" Ornstein said. Republican agenda at risk, too . While the president's fall agenda is at risk, the Republican agenda might suffer, too. Some of the most conservative members of Congress hoped to throw a massive wrench in the gears of Obamacare as they began to turn by attempting to defund the program. Senators Rand Paul, R-Kentucky and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are among those taking part in a Tea Party Patriots rally to defund the program Tuesday in Washington. With Congress in its first week back from vacation and the agenda topped by Syria, it's likely to get little attention -- or the message could morph into an anti-Syria rally. Congressional scholar Thomas Mann with the Brookings Institution said there could be a ""silver lining"" to Syria crowding out immigration and health care. He said the seriousness of the issue could make it more difficult for lawmakers to ""engage in this kind of brinksmanship.""",3,5.986338320836838
e98af823b96c2a6f9ae798987455595ccfa07ee9,CNN,"London, England (CNN) -- Eight years ago Justine Laymond was told by doctors to say a final goodbye to her family -- she had, they said, only hours left to live before her lungs would stop working and her body shut down. But this July Laymond defied her medical fate and made history by becoming the first double lung transplant survivor ever to have raced across an ocean. The 39-year-old from England, who has suffered nearly 20 lung collapses due to a condition known as Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), is part of a multinational crew taking part in the bi-annual Clipper Round the World Yacht Race -- the only sailing race in the world where crews are made up by ordinary people, many with little or no sailing experience. This year more than 500 people from 41 countries are taking part in the 40,000-mile relay race, which started in August 2011 and is set to finish later this month. The line-up this year consists of ten identical 68-foot long yachts -- all sponsored by different cities around the world -- that are currently on the eighth and final leg of the race. Laymond decided to get involved in the competition when she heard that the crew representing Edinburgh would have a relay team of transplant patients, surgeons and specialist nurses on its boat to raise awareness for organ transplantation -- something that saved her life six years ago. ""For years I suffered from chest pains but no one knew what was really wrong with me,"" said Laymond, who despite her pains led a very active life -- working at a gym and teaching children street dance in her spare time. ""When I was 31 I suffered a double lung collapse and was rushed to hospital. They referred me to a specialist who found hundreds and hundreds of cysts in my lungs and I finally got diagnosed with (this) rare condition,"" she said. The doctors told Laymond that, with no functioning right lung and only 30% capacity remaining in her left lung, she would be unable to have kids and that she would die if she didn't have a transplant. ""My world fell to pieces,"" said Laymond, whose condition quickly deteriorated after she was diagnosed and left her in a three-week-long coma fighting for her life. She refers to this period as her ""dark days,"" as she was slipping in and out of consciousness while on life support. In 2006, after 16 months of waiting and three false alarms, she finally received a new set of lungs in a 10 hour transplant operation, and she hasn't looked back since. ""I'm definitely a bit of a fighter. Because I had been in a coma I had to learn how to walk again and when I finally got out of hospital I decided to set myself daily challenges -- to do something different and to push my boundaries and defy the odds,"" said Laymond, who confessed that to date none of her challenges have been as difficult, or is ever likely to be as challenging as the Clipper race. More from Mainsail: Solo adventurer says she's relieved to be back on land . Indeed, it was far from plain sailing for Laymond's crew on board the ""Edinburgh Inspiring Capital"" yacht, whose Atlantic Ocean crossing was a grueling affair plagued by tropical storms and rough seas. With a weak immune system and only 60% lung capacity it was a mammoth challenge for Laymond: ""Towards the end I thought I couldn't do it. The cold got into my lungs and I got so weak that I thought I might have to be airlifted off and go to hospital to get some fluids and real food. But the skipper and the rest of my team were so fantastic and supportive that I managed to hang in there."" Her skipper Piers Dudin was impressed by Laymond's determination and spirit: ""Justine has done incredibly well, she had a tough race physically and she really grew with the race. ""What she is representing is hugely empowering to people with similar conditions and she has certainly showed that anyone can do it. I think the whole team can be proud of what she has achieved,"" he added. The Clipper Round the World Race is the brainchild of Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to ever sail solo nonstop around the world -- a feat which he managed to do in a journey that lasted 312 days between 1968 and 1969. Watch: Fastest man on water . He said he came up with the idea for the unique race while he was exploring Greenland in 1995 with British mountaineer Chris Bonington: ""Chris was telling me how much it cost him to climb Mount Everest and I thought to myself 'that's a lot of money' and then I asked myself what is the sailing equivalent of climbing the world's biggest mountain and the answer was obvious, it's the circumnavigation. ""So I did some calculations on the back of a cigarette packet right there and then and I thought 'actually I could do a round the world race for half of what it costs to climb Mount Everest.'"" The aim of the competition is to give everyone, regardless of sailing experience, the opportunity to experience the exhilaration of ocean racing. The first race took place in 1996; it consisted of eight boats and saw 300 people take part in the relay competition. See also: The enduring allure of tall ships . Since 1996 almost 3,000 people have competed in seven editions of the race, and although anyone can apply to take part, all selected crew members still have to pay a fee to join. It costs Â£10,000 (around $15500) to do one leg and Â£43,000 (around $67,000) to do the whole circumnavigation including four weeks of training. According to the organizers some people have sold their houses and given up their jobs to be able to join the challenge, others have managed to participate without ""any money in the bank"" by doing fundraising events. The only requirement is that you are over 18 and willing to work in a team and able to motivate yourself and others. Motivate others is exactly what Justine Laymond hopes her story will do: ""I have learned that life is too short -- so if you have a dream you just have to go out there and do it. ""Hopefully my story will inspire more people to become organ donors. It only takes minutes to register and it can save up to seven people's lives. It saved mine. I'm here because I've been given the gift of life and without that donation it would never have been possible.""",8,6.772899247435554
e5ae7dad00bebab1d86a199886c041e6567f2b60,CNN,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A crowd of about 10,000 came to Dodger Stadium on Saturday, but they weren't there for a baseball game. Job seeker Eric Clardy, right, shakes hands with recruiter Raul Mendez from L.A. County Probation Department. While the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, more than 80 employers set up employment booths in the parking lot just beyond the center field fence. To those who turned out, finding a job would be a home run. Participating companies included Coca-Cola, Lowe's and Union Bank. And government agencies including the FBI, the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers  were there, too. All had one thing in common: They were hiring. And that was music to the ears of 30-year-old Eric Clardy. It has been a rough couple of years for Clardy. He was laid off from his job as a loan processor when the real estate market started to tank. Then, after finding work as a project manager for a plumbing company, layoffs struck again. ""It's kind of like, get the job now so you can pay your bills, then start towards the career that you really want,"" he said. Clardy said his goal is to make contact with at least 10 potential employers a day via phone, letters and the Internet. Being unemployed is hard work, too.  Watch how Clardy goes about trying to find a job » . ""It was a scramble,"" Clardy said. ""I was selling insurance, doing temp jobs, going to job fairs."" The city of Los Angeles and the California Employment Development Department organized Saturday's event, which they said drew about 10,000 people. Earlier this month, a two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs at the stadium during baseball season drew about 7,000 applicants. California's unemployment rate is 10.1 percent, a full 2 percentage points higher than the national rate. The state's Employment Development office estimates that nearly a half-million state residents have lost their jobs in the past year. ""We are not seeing as many job opportunities as we saw a year ago,"" said Gloria Bratton Moore, who runs the state-funded Work Source job center in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, she said, ""There are jobs available."" But at Dodger Stadium, it was clear that competition for those available jobs is stiff. Applicants were often stacked four and five people deep in front of employer tables, and there was little chance for most of the 10,000 job seekers to make much of an impression. But organizers worked hard to pump up any flagging spirits. ""Yes we can. Yes we can,"" Los Angeles School Board member Monica Garcia chanted over a loudspeaker. State lawmaker Kevin deLeon told the crowd that they are among the nation's hardest-hit in this economic downturn, but he exhorted them to not give up. ""We will get out of this economic funk,"" he said. ""We will recover soon. We've got to have hope."" Garcia and deLeon's comments echoed the campaign slogans of President Obama, who recently won approval of a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Recruiters from the government agencies present at the job fair said that money will start creating jobs within the next few months. The Army Corps of Engineers told applicants that it is hiring for a wide variety of positions, including those for engineers, heavy-equipment operators and environmental field workers. The Commerce Department is adding more than 1 million jobs in preparation of the 2010 census, and other federal agencies are hiring as well. All of that was good news to Clardy, who left resumes and filled out applications at a number of the 80 booths cluttering the stadium's parking lot. But he remained realistic about this day's activities leading directly to a job. ""It seemed like a couple of years ago, the job fair was really your first interview,"" he said. ""Now it doesn't seem like that. Some companies are not even taking resumes at the job fairs anymore.""",5,6.177258043581414

5f2e5e2a00b00c1e51ee6959da0741842ba48770,CNN,"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Fourteen sailors are still missing from a Thai trawler that was sunk last week by the Indian navy as a suspected pirate ship, the vessel's owner said Tuesday. The Indian navy frigate INS Tabar was reported to have battled a ""pirate vessel"" last week. One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden, and one is confirmed dead, said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, owner of the Ekawat Nava 5. Last week, India's navy reported that the frigate INS Tabar had battled a pirate ""mother vessel"" in the gulf November 18, leaving the ship ablaze and likely sunk. Wicharn said that vessel was his ship, which was in the process of being seized by pirates when it came under fire. Indian authorities insisted that their ship had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack the Tabar. ""We fired in self-defense and in response to firing upon our vessel. It was a pirate vessel in the international waters, and its stance was aggressive,"" said Commodore Nirad Sinha, a navy spokesman. He said the ship the Tabar fired upon was laden with ammunition.  Watch more about the piracy threat in the region » . Wicharn said the Ekawat Nava 5 was headed from Oman to Yemen to deliver fishing equipment when it was set upon by pirates off the Horn of Africa. The pirates were seizing control of the ship when the Tabar moved in, he said. Wicharn said he learned the fate of his vessel from a Cambodian crew member who survived the gunfire and drifted in the ocean for six days before he was plucked to safety by a passing ship. The sailor was recovering in a hospital in Yemen, he said. Wicharn said his ship made a distress call November 18 as it was chased by pirates in two speedboats, but the connection was lost midway. The owners, Sirichai Fisheries, had not heard from the crew since then. Later that evening, the Indian navy said it encountered a suspected pirate ""mother vessel,"" with two speedboats in tow about 285 nautical miles (525 km) southwest of the Omani port of Salalah. ""Mother vessels"" are often used as mobile bases to ferry pirates and smaller attack boats into deep water. When the Tabar's crew hailed the ship and demanded that it stop for inspection, the pirates threatened to destroy the Indian ship, the ministry reported. ""Pirates were seen roaming on the upper deck of this vessel with guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The vessel continued its threatening calls and subsequently fired upon INS Tabar,"" the ministry said. The Indian frigate returned fire, setting the pirate ship ablaze and setting off explosions on board, the statement said.

0ff0299121aa9d1f0ddbe1fb0e9abb797c81b8ff,CNN,"(CNN) -- How are fads started and spread? Do certain influential people play a key role, or is it truly random? How does a trend go from new and exciting to old and passe so quickly? Does having happy friends have an effect on our own happiness? Maybe Twitter can tell us. Every second, millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140-character messages using Twitter. The ""tweets"" range from the mundane to the profound, and convey, for example, what people are doing, thinking and reading at any moment. The amount of information in any individual tweet is highly variable, but in aggregate the more than 65 million tweets composed per day represent a detailed, real-time trace of the collective thoughts and feelings of a significant fraction of the population -- potentially offering valuable information to everyone from politicians to advertisers to social researchers. To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets. We can observe very distinct patterns over the course of the day, as well as weekly patterns that match conventional wisdom, such as the tendency of users to write happier tweets on weekends. We also observe geographic variations, with users from Hawaii, California, and Florida, for example, using happier words in their tweets. With Twitter, we now not only know which users are communicating, but we also know what they are saying. From a research perspective, Twitter is more than just a new tool; it's an entirely new kind of tool. Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying. It is analogous to being allowed to tap into millions of water-cooler conversations, school rooms and other public conversations across the globe. Our study is preliminary; we need more data to do a proper evaluation, and the results are subject to any number of biases (people using language differently across the United States, and different demographics using Twitter at different times). Our approach simply looks, for example, for occurrences of ""happy"" or ""unhappy"" words in tweets. However, because we take words out of context, our approach will not correctly interpret tweets like ""I am not happy"". Even so, initial results demonstrate that Twitter data contain a wealth of information, and that even relatively simplistic approaches such as ours can extract interesting results. In fact, other research groups have also begun to examine Twitter data and have demonstrated that it can be used to predict the box-office success of an upcoming movie. And Twitter data yields much more detailed polling when compared to traditional methods, enabling real-time feedback for issues that are of local, national or international interest. In the past, researchers studying traces of human communication, such as phone records, have shown that the social network that connects us has rich hidden complexity. But legal and privacy concerns have caused these previous studies to almost universally omit the content of the communication. Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity. This is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to Twitter for its policy of open access to public tweets (exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the Library of Congress). Like any scientific tool, the ability to use the data for research is subject to caveats and limitations. Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer. Should we determine how to extract information reliably, which we're working on, the potential applications of the data are almost endless. For example, monitoring the mood of the public chatter on Twitter could allow businesses to quickly identify and respond to incidents, mitigating the effect of negative publicity on their brand. The data could be used to inform public policy, allowing public officials and politicians to receive feedback from their constituents in real time. From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society. Researchers can also investigate network effects: How does what our friends discuss influence what we discuss? In short, the data that is now becoming available from Twitter and related websites offers a new lens through which we can view society. It promises new approaches to understanding social phenomena, what some colleagues have dubbed ""computational social science."" This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.

Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, ""The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through."" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, ""We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament."" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. ""'All the players support Shahar,"" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, ""We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis."" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. ""I don't think it should happen,"" she said. ""I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete."" CNN Dubai bureau chief Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .",7,11.002630349894522
71ef1ca447818c469e745f7c9da7eda5fc2c40d7,CNN,"London (CNN) -- All flights into and out of London's Gatwick Airport were temporarily suspended Monday after a plane was forced to make an emergency landing amid reports of smoke in the cabin. A Virgin Atlantic flight bound for Orlando, Florida, left Gatwick Airport at 10:48 a.m. BST but returned to make an emergency landing due to a technical problem at 12:30 p.m. Emergency services were on the scene, and all passengers were evacuated from the plane, according to an airport statement. Virgin would not confirm or deny media reports that the cause for the landing was smoke in the airplane's cabin, but a spokeswoman for the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it sent six pieces of fire equipment to deal with an incident at the airport. The plane's emergency chutes were deployed to allow passengers to escape the aircraft, and four passengers sustained minor injuries, according to the airline. ""Due to a technical problem on board the aircraft, the captain decided as a precautionary measure to immediately evacuate the aircraft,"" Virgin said in a statement. ""Our teams at Gatwick are now looking after our passengers and assisting with their immediate requirements. Virgin Atlantic is working closely with the authorities to establish the cause of this incident."" Gatwick Airport's standby runway has been open since 2 p.m. BST to allow some flights to depart and arrive, but normal service has yet to resume, according to a spokeswoman. CNN's Richard Quest said the evacuation of passengers after an emergency landing is an unusual procedure suggesting that the incident was of a serious nature. ""The pilot must have feared there was a fire onboard or a potential of flames in order to order a full evacuation,"" he said. ""Otherwise you would just taxi in."" Virgin Atlantic said the Airbus A330-300 aircraft had 304 passengers, including three infants, and 10 crew members.

57a3b8718226ab27507757be804a8bae25ebcbb9,CNN,"(CNN) -- Just when it seems impossible for things to get uglier between the two heads of a key House investigative committee, they have. Hours after Democrat Elijah Cummings accused House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa of engaging in ""McCarthyism,"" Issa shot back with a letter to Cummings accusing him of obstructing the committee's IRS investigation, and even contributing to the agency's targeting of conservative grass roots groups. ""New IRS documents identified by the committee raise disturbing concerns about your possibly motivations for opposing this investigation and unwillingness to lend your support to efforts to obtain the testimony of former IRS exempt Organizations Director Lois G Lerner,"" Issa wrote to Cummings. Issa and fellow Republicans on the committee plan to hold a vote Thursday holding Lerner in contempt of Congress. Democrats say Republicans are trampling on Lerner's constitutional rights to remain silent, and released a Congressional Research Service report saying the only time in modern history Congress held witnesses in contempt was in the 1950s during the anti-communist McCarthy era, one of the darkest times in congressional history. At the heart of Issa's new allegations about Cummings are letters sent to a conservative group called True the Vote asking for information about the group. The head of True the Vote said Cummings tactics were the same as those used by the IRS, which she called ""unacceptable."" In addition, Issa is releasing what he says is new evidence Cummings contacted the IRS that Issa says may have helped spur inappropriate IRS questions to True the Vote. ""Several of your requests are virtually identical to the information requests sent by the IRS to True the Vote in February 2012,"" wrote Issa. ""This timeline and pattern of inquiries raises concerns that the IRS improperly shared protected taxpayer information with your staff,"" Issa wrote Cummings. Issa is also accusing Cummings of withholding information from committee Republicans about his communications with the IRS and True the Vote. ""The American people deserve to know the full truth. They deserve to know why the ranking member and minority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform surreptitiously contacted the IRS about an individual organization without informing the majority staff and even failed to disclose the contact after it became an issue during a subcommittee proceeding,"" said Issa. Cummings points out that he only requested public information from the IRS, and that he posted his inquiry to True to the Vote on his website -- so he wasn't hiding anything. ""I have made no secret of my concern about True the Vote's political activities,"" wrote Cummings. Cummings argues that in the case of True the Vote, there was legitimate concern about IRS granting tax-exempt status, since the group had given $5,000 to a state Republican organization, which tax-exempt groups are banned from doing. ""This political organization has raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates and describes itself as ""the largest caucus of Republican state leaders and the only national organization whose mission is to elect down ballot, state-level Republican office-holders,"" said Cummings, in a response letter to Issa.

13fe7021d740cf5630183c1487c12759fc5dbdd2,CNN,"(CNN) -- A Chicago hotel has closed and drained its pool, hot tub and fountain in response to the deaths of two people who contracted the flu-like Legionnaires' disease, authorities said Monday. Since August 14, health officials have recorded eight confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the two deaths, among guests who visited the JW Marriott Chicago hotel in downtown Chicago. ""We believe that there is no ongoing health threat at the hotel. Individuals who stayed at the hotel during this time period who are experiencing flu-like symptoms are encouraged to get in touch with a healthcare provider because it is important that all potential cases are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible,"" said Kathleen Ritger, a doctor at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source, such as cooling towers, air conditioning or showers. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills and a cough. Most people recover, but between 5% to 30% of those who get the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Each year an estimated 8,000 to 18,000 hospitalized cases occur in the United States. An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name. Along with draining a pool, fountain and hot tub, the hotel is working to alert guests who stayed there from July 16 through August 15, a Marriott spokeswoman said.

175e58b18b7cf1cbdbf17b94d39a2ffcd8ecd07e,CNN,"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department's renewal of Blackwater's contract to provide security in Iraq ""is bad news,"" an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said. A woman passes a burned car in Baghdad where Blackwater guards killed 17 in September. Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people, including women and children, last September, prompting an outcry and protest from Iraqi officials. ""This is bad news,"" al-Maliki adviser Sami al-Askari said. ""I personally am not happy with this, especially because they have committed acts of aggression, killed Iraqis, and this has not been resolved yet positively for families of victims."" About 25,000 private contractors from three companies protect diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials in Iraq. Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have immunity from Iraqi prosecution.  Watch Iraqis express anger over the announcement » . Al-Askari said he would push for the Iraqi government to contest the contract renewal. ""The U.S. government has the right to choose what contractors it chooses, but Iraq should also have the right to allow or ban certain contractors from operating on its territory,"" he said. Al-Askari said there is a general mood of displeasure within the Iraqi government because of the contract renewal. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said a joint Iraqi-U.S. commission was set up after the shootings, and Iraqis told U.S. officials that the rules of engagement and use of force must be changed. As a result, a State Department security officer accompanies every convoy manned by contractors, Al-Dabbagh said, and every vehicle is outfitted with a security camera. Recordings from the camera are sent to a command center. Al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government still wants Blackwater to come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi law and its courts. ""Most importantly, the Iraqi investigation concluded that Blackwater committed a crime at Nusour Square,"" he said. ""The U.S. informed us that the FBI investigation is still not done, and if Blackwater [personnel are] ... convicted, then the contract will be reviewed."" Another al-Maliki adviser, Sadeq al-Rikabi, said the contract would be temporary since the U.N. mandate under which the United States operates in Iraq will expire at the end of the year, to be replaced by a bilateral agreement under negotiation. ""No doubt, the role of the U.S. military and contractors will be agreed on"" in the new arrangement, al-Rikabi said. Blackwater is one of three contractors working under a ""task order"" to provide security services in Iraq. The other two are Triple Canopy and DynCorp. The State Department contract must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month. In effect, Blackwater's contract will roll over for another year, said Greg Starr, who heads the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service. Starr said new rules and an agreement between the State Department and U.S. military have improved coordination and the supervision of contractors. Blackwater must work under the rules of the Iraqi government, he said. The FBI is in charge of the U.S. investigation of the September incident, in which survivors and victims' family members contend Blackwater guards started shooting without provocation. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder."" Starr said the U.S. government, in particular U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, will take a close look at the FBI's investigation report, ""and then we decide whether it is consistent with U.S. goals and policies to continue the contract."" It will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible, or merely a few of its employees, Starr said. ""We can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to,"" he said. ""I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going find in its investigation. It's complex. I think the U.S. government needs protective services."" ""I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen,"" Starr said. ""Essentially, I think they do a very good job. The September 16 incident was a tragedy; it needs to be investigated carefully. The results of that will come out eventually and we will decide how we will proceed.""

4d79004ec7b3e58f17f0d00a1ddb706cff1c1d08,CNN,"(CNN) -- When the world first met Mickey Mouse, it was as a steamboat captain, a cowboy, a wizard's apprentice and in other roles that, while enduring, wouldn't exactly be considered tech-savvy to a 2013 audience. But before the famous mouse came along, Walt Disney created a character who possessed many of the traits of today's gadget geek -- and who maintains his technological edge over Mickey to this day. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit will be familiar by now to players of ""Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two,"" released in November, and the original title in the series from Disney Interactive Studios. And his role in the innovative video game franchise might just be spurring a renaissance 80 years in the making for the long-forgotten character. In the original game, Oswald appeared as a spurned toon jealous of Mickey's immense popularity. He ultimately comes to see the famous mouse as a younger brother. (Oswald was created by Disney in 1927. Mickey appeared the following year.) But in their followup outing, they appear as equal partners. Becky Cline, director of the Walt Disney Archives, said despite being the older one, Oswald was much more into technology than his younger brother, Mickey. Early cartoons featuring Oswald portrayed him as a creative, mechanically inclined rabbit. ""One of his early cartoons was called 'The Mechanical Cow,' where he builds a robot cow,"" Cline said. ""The character himself is very innovative and clever. He winds up his own ears and makes himself into a helicopter, or he takes off an ear and uses it to row a canoe."" In ""Epic Mickey 2,"" the technology gap between the two characters remains. Oswald wields a radio device that allows him shoot electricity, create electrified fields and control robotic enemies. Mickey uses a magical paintbrush, allowing him to create using paint or destroy using thinner. In the game's story, the two combine their divergent powers to save Oswald's homeland from destruction (again). Light Years blog: Mickey Mouse spotted on Mercury? Creative director Warren Spector said Oswald's evolution in the franchise has been designed to reintroduce him to fans after being absent since 1951. His techie edge combines with physical and behavioral differences to set him apart from Mickey, Spector says. ""In the second game, they start out as allies, as companions, as collaborators,"" Spector said. ""They're still brothers, though, so there is still tension between them. Brothers always have tension, but that doesn't mean they don't work together to accomplish common goals."" Spector said the differences between the more modern Oswald and the old-school Mickey is evident in their behaviors. He describes Mickey as ""Boy Scout-like,"" ""a good guy,"" ""always doing the right thing."" ""Oswald is more modern in a sense, because he's a little bit less well-behaved, a little bit quicker to anger, a little bit, dare I say, edgier,"" he said. ""I think it was appropriate that he was the one who adopted the technology."" In the game, Mickey's paintbrush is better at dealing with other cartoon characters, while Oswald's high-tech gear more effectively takes on robots and other mechanical obstacles. ""He's a vintage character, but he has such a modern sensibility to him,"" Cline says. ""He's kinda cool. Kids, teenagers, young people and adults, they're all finding him appealing, and he's a really funny character. He's really kinda hip, actually."" Spector said outside of the game, Oswald has caught on with fans quicker than he would have imagined. ""I hope it is just a start for something bigger for Oswald,"" he said. ""He is a great character and deserves a life of his own in games and not just as Mickey's sidekick."" And none of it would have been possible if the animated techie hadn't once been swapped for a football announcer. Walt Disney lost the rights to his rabbit to Universal shortly after creating him in 1927. However, when NBC wanted to bring sports announcer Al Michaels to their Sunday night football games in 2006, Disney had an opportunity to bring home the wayward character. While there were many other parts to the deal, it is the Oswald-for-Michaels trade that people remember . ""Oswald is definitely worth more than a fourth-round draft choice,"" Michaels said. ""I'm going to be a trivia answer someday."" Oswald also, for the first time, gets a voice in ""Epic Mickey 2."" Famed voice actor Frank Welker, who did the voice of Fred in the Scooby-Doo cartoons and was a voice double for Leonard Nimoy in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"" was chosen to be the voice of the Lucky Rabbit. ""I think he's probably the greatest living voice artist in the world,"" Spector said. ""When it came to Oswald, (begins to mimic Oswald's voice) I hear Oswald in my head all the time, and he sounds sort of like this (normal voice) and they said what do you think about Frank Welker, and I just said yes."" For all his modern tendencies and techno toys, Spector wants people to just look at how ""cartoony -- that's really the only word I can think of"" Oswald is, a throwback to the old days of cartooning and cartoon characters. ""People have a tendency to think of Disney cartoons as being more realistic or more grounded and less anarchic and crazy and cartoony than some other studios,"" he said. ""Oswald puts the lie to that. In every way that matters, Walt got there first.""",6,8.048522057326117
aba4d3a4fb8a650387b3166de5f741274add1a49,CNN,"(CNN) -- From the moment the ancient Greeks held the first Olympics 2,700 years ago, our picture perfect image of elite sportsmen has revolved around the oiled, ripped, macho body. But not all our leading sports stars fit the stereotypical bill of chest-thumping demigods. Some, such as jockeys, instead go to extreme lengths to stunt their growth -- sometimes down to the size of a pre-pubescent child. In an industry where just a few extra pounds can rule you out of a multi-million dollar race, jockeys are put under enormous pressure to meet miniature weight requirements. In the U.S the minimum riding weight is 53kg -- around the average size of a 14 to 15-year-old boy. And for the rider desperate to shed a crucial pound before a competition, one seemingly drastic option may be to purge themselves in a specially designed ""heaving bowl"". It may sound shocking to those outside the racing industry. But the basins installed at U.S. race tracks for vomiting, or ""flipping"" as it is known in the trade, is one of the more extreme dieting methods used by professional jockeys. The use of heaving bowls still remains largely taboo, with 2004 HBO documentary ""Jockey"" causing a stir after it showed footage of the bowls at Churchill Downs race track -- home of the prestigious Kentucky Derby. Retired jockey Jeff Johnston says they are still a regular, if unspoken, sight at many U.S. race tracks. ""It's a square, porcelain bowl with a big hole to flush down the vomit,"" said Johnston, now regional manager for The Jockeys Guild -- the riders' welfare association. ""They're usually in their own cubicle at the end of a line of toilets."" Riders would lose their teeth due to the constant acidic bile, some even to the point of needing dentures. However he added that some of the basins had been removed since he quit riding professionally six years ago. New race tracks also tend not to install them. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association and The Jockeys Guild did not have figures on how many heaving bowls were still in use. Johnston never used the bowls himself, instead relying on strict dieting, saunas and diuretics, known as ""water pills,"" which help the body excrete fluid. ""I wouldn't say heaving bowls are frowned upon within the trade,"" he said, adding: ""Everyone has their own methods of losing weight, but rather than vomiting, I'd say the number one way is still dehydration. It's not uncommon for guys to lose three to four pounds a day in the hot box. ""We're just in the process now of educating jockeys on safe dieting and bringing up minimum weights -- the U.S. is a lot behind Europe in that sense."" Sweat suits, saunas, hot baths and starvation are still very much in use in the racing industry on both sides of the Atlantic, even if there is a growing movement to change it, says Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical officer at the Irish Turf Club, which regulates racing in Ireland. ""The bad old days of extreme dieting methods haven't fully gone by any means,"" he said. ""Starvation is still a very common practice in that the jockey may not eat for 24 hours or more before a race, and combine this with a sauna or hot bath."" Among Irish jockeys, 14% use vomiting as a method for meeting weight requirements, Dr McGoldrick and his team found in a 2011 study into dieting habits. Another 71% admitted to restricting their food intake, while 81% exercise in sweat suits and 86% use saunas. Malnutrition, muscle depletion, decreased blood flow and even depression, were some of the consequences of such rapid weight loss methods, according to Dr McGoldrick. Anna-Louise MacKinnon, medical adviser at the British Professional Jockeys Association (PJA), which promotes the interest of riders in the UK, said there was no evidence small amounts of weight loss -- such as two or three pounds -- was dangerous -- but larger amounts, such as over seven pounds, posed long-lasting health risks. She added that one of the biggest concerns was slower reaction times in dehydrated jockeys. A hungry, dizzy rider on a 450kg horse galloping at 40km, posed a danger to everyone on the track, she said. The PJA is now hoping to raise its minimum weight , currently the lowest in Europe alongside Italy. At 49kg, it's roughly the same size as an average 13-year-old boy. While some jockeys still undertake dangerous crash dieting methods, things have vastly improved in the last ten years, with a new emphasis on education and support services in Britain, Dr McKinnon said. British jockey George Baker, who at 6ft is one of the tallest riders in the game, acknowledges it is a constant struggle sticking to strict diets. The 30-year-old must keep his weight down to 57kg, following a regime of low-calorie meals, hot baths and exercise in sweat suits. For breakfast, Baker will usually have a bowl of cereal and a cup of tea. Lunch consists solely of a piece of fruit and for dinner he will tuck into some steamed chicken and vegetables. ""On a Saturday night I might treat myself to a nice meal -- a starter and a main course,"" he said. ""Mentally, it's very important to have a break now and then."" So why do some jockeys still put themselves through such a punishing, potentially dangerous routine in the pursuit of getting to -- and staying at -- the pinnacle of their sport? ""Some of them just love to ride,"" says Johnston. ""But for others it's a livelihood and they've got a family to support. By whatever means necessary, they've got to keep putting food on the table."" Whether the jockeys themselves will also enjoy that food is a different matter.",7,8.869710264942697

74954cf0ea5b1c2628155677ed8ff5c8e4bb1cbd,CNN,"West Liberty, Kentucky (CNN) -- Cleanup workers make plodding progress Monday in parts of Kentucky and Indiana where fresh snow complicated efforts to dig out of the destruction wrought by last week's deadly tornadoes. About three inches of snow fell overnight in West Liberty, Kentucky. One resident there, George Weddington, worked to repair the roof of a building next to a more than 100-year-old church that had its top torn off. He recalled what he did during the storm. ""I was really praying for us -- and I realized I was being selfish -- and I just started praying for everybody, you know. I don't know if that helped or not, but I did my best,"" he said. Roads were slick as crews worked to restore power in tornado-ravaged areas. A fresh blanket of snow also covered storm debris in Henryville, Indiana, where residents were just beginning to pick up the pieces after two tornadoes hit the town, including an EF-4 twister, with winds of up to 200 mph. Debris and downed power lines forced authorities to block roadways. Half of the town remained without power and gas, Indiana State Police Sgt. Gary Jessee said early Monday. The tornado outbreak began Friday and extended into the next day, affecting millions of people from Indiana to Georgia. At least 42 tornadoes swept across 10 states on Friday, the National Weather Service said. Alabama town struck twice in one year . By the time the powerful storm system faded, 40 were dead: 22 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Georgia. The tornadoes paralyzed a large part of eastern Kentucky, one of several states that requested Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to help conduct assessments. ""The damage I saw yesterday was the worst I've seen. ... It was a war zone, debris everywhere, buildings destroyed, other buildings just the walls standing, roofs gone. It was a terrible sight,"" Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters Sunday, describing his visit to the tornado-ravaged town of West Liberty. As the focus turned to caring for survivors whose lives were turned upside down by the storm, hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed, while good Samaritans donated what they could. ""When something like this happens, everybody wants to ... pull together, to help each other out. That's what it's all about,"" volunteer Victor Jett said. Bloomington, Indiana, resident Ron Stanhouse rushed to Henryville to help his college roommate after the storm. ""I had stopped and bought a generator and a chain saw and a bunch of gas and gloves, thinking maybe we were going to cut some trees and repair his house,"" Stanhouse told CNN's iReport, ""but there were no houses there."" Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Goodin said the destruction left authorities there with ""no idea how many people are left homeless."" In Henryville, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, the EF-4 tornado destroyed schools, homes and businesses, leaving many parts of the town unrecognizable, Kevin Welz told CNN's iReport. ""It is something you would expect to see in an end-of-the-world movie,"" he said. A toddler who had survived the storm in New Pekin, about 20 miles west of Henryville, died Sunday afternoon after family members took her off life support, Jefferson County Coroner Bob Jones said. Tiny symbol of tornado survival dies . The 14-month-old girl had been in critical condition, surrounded by extended family members at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, said hospital spokesman Brian Rublein.

155f21b6f98d654f16f9ec237c2fae3c1db99ad5,CNN,"(CNN) -- A 1-year-old child whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die will likely have an operation to allow the insertion of a breathing tube by the end of the week, his new hospital said. Joseph Maraachli, widely known in the media as Baby Joseph, is being evaluated by doctors at SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, hospital spokesman Bob Davidson said. The hospital had planned to have a press conference on Tuesday but canceled it ""because there is not yet a firm treatment plan,"" he said in a statement late Monday. But the head of pediatrics at the hospital, Robert Wilmott, expects a tracheotomy to go ahead by the end of the week, the statement said. A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck. A tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs, creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator, and is more comfortable for the child, the statement said. Joseph, who has a deteriorating neurological condition, was transferred to Cardinal Glennon Sunday from a hospital in London, Ontario. Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada since October. His doctor, in court papers, said that ""all cranial nerve functions are now absent"" and there is no hope for recovery. He recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, sought instead to have their son receive a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation so that he could be transferred home, where he would be cared for by his family. The child's aunt, Samar Nadar, has said that in 2002 the Maraachlis' daughter died at home with a tracheotomy after suffering a similar condition. In January, a Canadian Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the hospital, saying it could remove the child's breathing tube without a replacement, and issue a do-not-resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care. The Maraachlis fought to have their son relocated to a U.S hospital for a second opinion. The hospital in Canada said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. In a statement on the hospital's website, it says Joseph's transfer on Sunday happened ""despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts."" The Maraachli case gained the attention of pro-life groups including Priests for Life and the Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network, who organized prayer vigils and rallies in support of the family. In February, the hospital began receiving threats and increased security to protect its staff. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer. He issued a news release saying: ""After around-the-clock negotiations, this really became a race against time."" Joseph ""needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line,"" he said. CNN Medical Producer Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.",8,6.169777220255545
ce283a404e8ae9ac673f334567a104ca90fe2def,CNN,"(CNN) -- Germany's intelligence service has intercepted phone calls by two U.S. secretaries of state, German media reports reveal. The news comes several months after Germany complained about the United States eavesdropping on its politicians. German intelligence service BND intercepted a phone call from then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""by chance"" while Clinton was traveling on a U.S. government plane, the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. The magazine Der Spiegel said this happened in 2012. And Der Spiegel reported BND intercepted a satellite call from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in 2013. According to the Sueddeutsche article, unnamed members of the German government claim that the wiretapping was accidental and not part of a widespread operation to eavesdrop on U.S. politicians. Der Spiegel said the recorded calls were deleted. Sueddeutsche says it and German public broadcasters NDR and WDR based their reports on documents from the case of a German intelligence agent who'd given information to the CIA. Sueddeutsche gives the man's name simply as Markus R. and said he was arrested in July after giving the CIA at least 218 classified documents. Der Spiegel, quoting unnamed sources, also reported the Germans have spied on Turkey, a NATO member state. The magazine said it viewed documents supporting the claim from 2009. Relations between Germany and the United States have suffered lately because of revelations about intelligence gathering. Last month, Germany kicked out the CIA station chief in Berlin after learning that two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- were suspected of spying for the United States. Last year, Edward Snowden leaked information that the National Security Agency tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. A German prosecutor has opened an investigation into the matter. The U.S. State Department and representatives for Clinton declined to comment Sunday. CNN Senior Political Correspondent Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.",6,8.879673945371268
0a1ad82d161d90d758240407cb8c8fcebff4a212,CNN,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited. Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949. Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of ""simple-living and hard struggle,"" as Chairman Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt. China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags. The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center. It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. ""The Chinese people have stood up!"" he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent. For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally. He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear. Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing. He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, over 550,000 ""rightist"" intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million Chinese. In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he rallied hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who lionized him like a demi-god. ""To rebel is justified!"" they proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise. Perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people's incomparable resilience and their ability to ""chi ku"" (eat bitterness, or bear hardship). Mao's reign is also credited for positive changes. He banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line and started a space program with China's first satellite launch. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations. Still, for three decades under Mao, China tried to break out of its backwardness and isolation but only met modest success. Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.  Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown » . Soon enough, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the new paramount leader. Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world. His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector. Just south of Tiananmen, one landmark stands as a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does brisk business, with a large portrait of founder Colonel Sanders hanging on the three-story building. Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy. Old Guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a great deal of misgiving. The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform. After six weeks of heady demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed.  See landmark moments in China's 60 years » . China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, the speed and breadth of which is unparalleled in the history of mankind. China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world.

Chinese president Hu Jintao is pushing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society.

5e4a9e1665fac51059650a9c9ccad1be1f0d4210,CNN,"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When you refuse to acknowledge a group of people in all their nuances and complexities, or depict them as predictable and one-dimensional, or dictate for them a code of acceptable behavior, it is a blatant sign of disrespect. It would be offensive for someone to suggest that all Italian-Americans think a certain way, all Irish-Americans behave a certain way or all African-Americans vote a certain way. So it is with 50.5 million Hispanic Americans, who come in every variety imaginable. You might know this from what you consume daily in the form of political messaging, media images and advertising campaigns from Madison Avenue. What better time to assert the right of Hispanics to be unpredictable and complicated human beings than Hispanic Heritage Month, which gives Americans the chance to learn more about, and pay respect to, the nation's largest minority. In 1968, Congress set aside one week each year to honor the contributions and culture of Hispanics. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation expanding the period to 30 days: September 15 to October 15. A generation or two ago, the challenge for Hispanics was simply to get noticed by corporations and political parties. That happened. Ten million votes cast in a presidential election, and roughly $1 trillion in buying power, is hard to ignore. Today, the new challenge is to get those same corporations and political parties to see Hispanics as they really are as opposed to how others want them to be or assume them to be. For example, in the past several weeks, I've been asked often on radio and television interviews to predict where the Hispanic vote will go in the 2012 election. My answer: Just about everywhere. Will Hispanics take a chance on the Republican presidential nominee -- especially if it is Texas Gov. Rick Perry who has a record of attracting Hispanic support to the point of being attacked by Republican rivals who mistakenly cast the immigration debate as ""us"" vs. ""them"" and put Hispanics in the ""them"" camp? Or will they double down by sticking with President Barack Obama who, while earning two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008, also heads an administration that has repeatedly lied to and manipulated Hispanics by promising immigration reform but delivering only record numbers of deportations -- more than 1 million since Obama took office? My answer: Yes. Both those things will happen. And more. This is not a monolith. The Hispanic population in the United States is made up of conservatives, liberals, middle-of-the-road moderates, Republicans, Democrats, independents and everything in-between. It's true that most Hispanics are registered Democrats, just like they have been for the past five decades dating back to the ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in 1960. But it is also true that Hispanics have -- in gubernatorial, congressional and presidential races over the years -- been willing to cross party lines and support moderate Republicans who eschew anti-Hispanic nativism and craft a message that appeals to them. You see that sort of thing much more often at the local and state level than you do in the federal arena. But it happens everywhere. The list of Republicans who enjoyed significant Hispanic support in their political careers is long and distinguished. It includes George W. Bush, John McCain, Jeb Bush, Rudolph Giuliani, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and two former Arizona governors -- Fife Symington and Jane Hull. Of course, among Hispanics, there are differences in geography, economic status and educational attainment that help shape how they see the world and their place in it. There are also ancestral differences. According to the 2010 census, about two-thirds of those 50.5 million people are Mexican or Mexican-American. The other third is made up of Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, Salvadorans, Brazilians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Colombians, Venezuelans and others. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and self-described ""son of exiles"" who is being talked about as possibly landing on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket, is the darling of South Florida. Yet, if Rubio were on the GOP ticket, he is likely to be very unpopular in the Southwest where many Mexican-Americans resent Rubio's hard line on illegal immigration. It's easy to talk tough about border security or oppose ""amnesty"" when you represent a community in which came here on the red carpet of the Cuban Adjustment Act, a relic of the Cold War that makes it almost impossible to remove Cuban immigrants once they arrive on these shores. But besides those differences, there are also similarities. Regardless of their backgrounds or biographies or biases, Hispanics want what the rest of their countrymen want: The chance to work for a brighter tomorrow, the right blend of rights and responsibilities and the respect that comes from being seen as individuals and not just part of a group. And why not? That's the American way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.",4,10.01867048446218
6ecee08cedc18ee2a9b172237c340cd6526394eb,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has defended the UK's involvement in the war in Afghanistan following the British Army's bloodiest day of the near eight-year conflict. Soldiers from the Welsh Guards carry the coffin of Maj Sean Birchall, killed on patrol in Afghanistan in June. Addressing lawmakers on Monday, Brown said the security of Afghanistan was crucial to preventing terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world. ""In 2009 the case for our continued involvement is the same: to prevent terrorist attacks in Britain and across the world by dealing with the terrorist threat at its source -- that crucible of terror on the border and mountain areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Brown told the House of Commons. ""I am confident that we are right to be in Afghanistan, that we have the strongest plan and the resources to do the job."" Brown also rejected suggestions that British troops, who are fighting alongside other coalition and Afghan forces in Helmand province, are dying unnecessarily because they do not have enough helicopters -- leaving them vunerable to ambush because they have to travel by road.  See a map of Helmand province » . ""It's a sad fact that helicopters would not have saved the lives of the individuals last week,"" he said, citing Lt. Col. Nick Richardson, a British military spokesman in Afghanistan. ""British armed forces are better equipped today than at any time... in the past 40 years. In the last two years we have increased helicopter numbers by 60 percent and... capacity by 84 percent."" But opposition leader David Cameron argued that helicopter capacity in Afghanistan has not risen as fast as troop levels. ""Isn't the real point this, that the number of troops has doubled since 2006, so proportionally there hasn't really been in increase in helicopter capacity at all?"" the leader of the Conservative Party demanded. The former chief of the defense staff, Charles Guthrie, ""has said more helicopters would save lives,"" Cameron said.

""If we cannot move our forces by air, they are more vulnerable on the ground,"" Conservative defense spokesman Liam Fox said Monday, asking if the Labour government had made a mistake by cutting the helicopter budget in 2004.

""That kind of ""hand-to-hand fighting... cannot be conducted from inside a highly armored vehicle and it cannot be conducted from a helicopter."" Ainsworth said more helicopters were on the way, but that many operations ""cannot be conducted from helicopters."" On Monday the Stop the War Coalition, which has campaigned against British involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, urged Brown to withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan, calling the conflict ""an unwinnable and unjustified war."" ""We urge the British government to end now this futile war which, if continued, will only mean more wasted lives of British soldiers, countless deaths of Afghan civilians and further devastation of a country that has suffered from decades of war and occupation,"" the group said in a statement.",7,7.982919986765909
cd6d8f35f8babcf0e8bad0ff4fda4aed42582f7b,CNN,"(CNN) -- A famous South Korean rock singer is just hours away from swimming into the diplomatic row over a small group of rocky islets in the East Sea, or the Sea of Japan. Kim Jang-hoon is among dozens of amateur athletes who left the eastern port of Uljin Monday, bound for Dokdo, a largely uninhabited set of volcanic islands claimed by both South Korea and Japan, known by Tokyo as Takeshima. The group's 55-hour, 230-kilometer relay swim is expected to end Wednesday, on the 67th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule. Before jumping into the water, singer Kim Jang-Hoon told reporters: ""I will never make such a comment as 'Dokdo is our territory' when I arrive there. It's meaningless to do so because they are undeniably our territory,"" according to the Yonhap news agency. The politically-charged event comes days after Lee Myung-Bak broke with convention to become the first South Korean president to visit the contested islands. Read more: What's behind island dispute? ""Dokdo is indeed our territory and a place worth staking our lives to defend. Let's make sure to safeguard (the islets) with pride,"" he was reported to have told police officers stationed on the islands. Lee's visit inflamed Japan which recalled its ambassador to Seoul, Masatoshi Muto, and threatened to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice. ""President Lee visited Takeshima, which is an inherent territory of Japan, both in the light of historical facts and based on international law. Therefore it is incompatible with the position of Japan, and so I made a strong protest on the matter,"" Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told a press conference Friday.

The recent flare-up over who owns the islands even spilled onto soccer the pitch during the final days of the London Olympics. At the request of Japan, the International Olympic Commitee withheld the bronze medal from South Korean player Park Jongwoo after he held a banner during post-match celebrations supporting South Korea's ownership of the islands. An official from the Korean Football Association told CNN that the body had been asked to investigate the case by FIFA, soccer's ruling body, and submit its results by Thursday. ""It is proven from photos that Park's action was not intentional. He didn't make the sign,"" the official told CNN. ""As you can see from photos, a fan was holding the sign during the match and Park got it from the fan."" Dokdo/Takeshima is one of several of disputed island chains in the region and fears are emerging that competing territorial claims in the South China Sea could create a new Cold War in Asia.

The 34-year-old has been at the summit for an unprecedented 612 weeks in total, but once again faces the prospect of losing top spot to fellow American Phil Mickelson -- and a new contender, world No. 3 Lee Westwood. While second-ranked Mickelson has failed to take advantage of Woods' struggles in recent weeks, finishing only tied for 48th at the British Open, Westwood has racked up the points after placing second at his home major last month. The Englishman can go to No. 1 if he wins at Firestone and Woods is outside the top two -- or if he is second, the defending champion is 10th or lower and Mickelson does not win. Mickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37. ""Am I conscious of the pack closing in?

de1246d7e5fac0045967562c9cb0896e01daf04f,CNN,"Mosul, Iraq (CNN) -- The last U.S. brigade combat team in Iraq has left the country, a move that helps U.S. President Barack Obama reach his goal of 50,000 troops in the country by September 1. Their departure leaves about 56,000 U.S. troops in the country, according to the U.S. military. Capt. Christopher Ophardt, spokesman for the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, said the last of the 4,000 members of the unit crossed the border into Kuwait early Thursday. A few hundred members stayed behind to finish administrative and logistical duties but will fly out of Baghdad later Thursday, Ophardt said. Much of the brigade departed more than a day ago, but the announcement was delayed for security reasons. Tell us how the Iraq War has affected your life . Their departure comes more than seven years after U.S. combat forces entered, though their departure does not signify the end of all U.S. combat forces in the country. Another 6,000 U.S. troops must leave Iraq to meet Obama's deadline for the end of U.S. combat operations in the country and the beginning of Operation New Dawn, in which the remaining U.S. forces are expected to switch to an advise-and-assist role. A public information officer at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, said it will take a few weeks for all of the 4-2's members to return home. ""It is one flight at a time,"" she said. ""We are expecting most of them to be home by mid-September."" As they prepared to depart, some soldiers laughed and some expressed relief at having survived multiple deployments.

""We're keeping the promise that we've made when I began my campaign for the presidency,"" Obama said Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio, where he was attending a Democratic fundraiser. ""By the end of this month ... our combat mission will be over in Iraq."" Obama said that more than 90,000 U.S. troops have left Iraq in the past 18 months. ""And, consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year,"" he said. Former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN that the United States has plenty of work left to do in Iraq. ""Iraq is still at the beginning of the story of its evolution since 2003,"" he said, referring to the date of the U.S.-led invasion of the country. ""As tired as many Americans may be, this process is still just at its beginning."" In fact, Iraq remains without a functioning government, electricity and other utilities are available only sporadically in the capital, and violence appears to be increasing. At least 48 people were killed Tuesday outside a military recruiting center in Baghdad. ""We're going to have to leave a large footprint behind, and this is not going away for us as an issue,"" he said. The State Department is preparing to leave much of that footprint. It will handle many of the responsibilities currently shouldered by the military, increasing its security contractors from 2,700 to nearly 7,000, sources said. They are expected to work with diplomats and police trainers in some facilities. The State Department has asked for an additional $400 million to cover the costs, though it was not clear they would get it. The State Department has asked the U.S. military to leave behind surveillance systems, about 50 bomb-resistant vehicles and a few dozen UH-60 helicopters, a military official said. Though they got a lot of what they wanted, the Pentagon said it could not give them all the helicopters because they are needed in Afghanistan, the official said.

e52b4bba7d544a2bececabe9a816e625c433c7ed,CNN,"Bangkok (CNN) -- When Brazil and Croatia hit the pitch for the 2014 FIFA World Cup opener on Thursday, football fanatics in Bangkok will be forced to contend with more than an unfriendly time zone if they want to catch the action. The nationwide midnight to 4 a.m curfew, imposed by the military three weeks ago when it took over the country in a coup after months of political and social unrest, has been lifted in more than 30 provinces and districts, including Thailand's tourist hotspots such as Phuket, Pattaya, Krabi and Koh Samui. But not Bangkok. This poses a problem for the city's notoriously diehard football fans who want to watch the games with friends and fellow revelers -- many of the matches start between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time. ""I'm a bit worried about staying out late to watch the games, but it should be fine, as police and military aren't that strict about the curfew,"" says Wisit Konkratoke, a 33-year-old Bangkok graphic designer and a self-described huge football fan. Wisit says he doubts bars will be airing all the matches due to the curfew so he'll likely watch at a friend's house. ""Solders have stopped me after midnight on the road to ask where I'm going, and when I tell them I'm going home it's fine, they let me carry on,"" he says. Speaking to reporters last week, members of the ruling junta said they will not be lifting the curfew in the capital just so people can watch football, advising fans to go home early and cheer on their favorite teams with their families instead. Bangkok bars work around curfew . During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Bangkok was filled with viewing parties, many offering fans giant LED screens and outdoor beer gardens. Waves of supporters dressed in the colors of their teams. (Thailand has never qualified for a World Cup.) But the time zone was friendlier then, with evening games the norm. And there was no curfew. This time around, many sports pubs are trying to find ways around the midnight-4 a.m. curfew. Some say they're planning to push their luck. Nick Wetzel, owner of The Pickled Liver, a downtown British pub frequented by Bangkok expats, says curfew enforcement varies widely from day to day, so he's unsure how things will go during the month-long football event. ""I have every intention of showing as many games as possible, depending on public demand,"" says Wetzel. ""Unfortunately, with the curfew still in place it's hard to know what to expect, especially from the police. They came to my bar at 1 a.m. this morning to close it down, so I hope this will not set a precedent for the World Cup. ""I can only hope that given the importance of the matches coupled with Thailand's love of the beautiful game, they will let us watch the tournament in peace. Only time will tell."" Other Bangkok pubs have said they'll allow patrons in only as late as midnight, then will let visitors watch behind locked doors. ""We will be open but due to the current curfew space will be limited to upstairs,"" advertises the Clubhouse Sports Bar and Grill on its website. ""Customers will need to be in before 12 and can leave at their discretion (although we would not advise it)."" Some are keeping their fingers crossed that the junta will lift the curfew. ""At present we can only show 11 p.m. games and games starting at 5 a.m, but we are hoping the curfew will be lifted Thursday,"" says a representative from Bangkok's The Sportman Bar and Restaurant, another popular haunt among expats and visiting tourists. Wichian Nunporntasak, who owns a restaurant and bar called ""Cheek"" on Bangkok's Ratchaphruek Road, says the curfew has harmed his business, though he understands why the military is concerned about keeping the city safe. ""I'm not worried about the curfew for the games at 11 p.m., I'll still air them and hope we don't get shut down before the end,"" he says. ""But I won't be able to stay open for the later matches. I'll probably have to go to a friend's house to watch them. ""The army has been nice every time I'm stopped on the road after curfew, as I explain that I'm heading home from work."" Khao San Road goes quiet . CNN visited Khao San Road this week to find out how bar owners and guest houses plan to deal with the curfew situation during the World Cup. A popular stop for backpackers thanks to the high concentration of guest houses, tour agencies, bars and restaurants in the old part of the city, the strip is usually a favorite World Cup viewing spot for the local and international football crowd. But this year, the consensus seems to be that while many bars will try to get away with airing the 11 p.m. games, that's as hard as they'll push it. Multiple bar staff told CNN that police were strictly enforcing the curfew and making bars close promptly at midnight -- though plenty of tourists continue to roam the strip after closing time. Some bars said they hadn't even bought the license to air the games, but will do so if the junta lifts the curfew soon. A staff member at Nat Guest House, who didn't want to be named, said the establishment will likely let people watch in the common area but will have to keep the noise down in consideration of guests.

On the sidelines of Thailand's political drama, confusion over just how many of the World Cup games locals will be able to watch at home played out in the courts this week. Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) tried to force RS International, the exclusive rights holder for the FIFA World Cup, to allow Thailand's free TV channels to broadcast all of the World Cup matches. Earlier, RS won the case in Thailand's Central Administrative Court and announced it would televise only 22 World Cup matches on free TV. The rest could be viewed only through purchased TV boxes. The NBTC appealed the court's ruling but were shut down on Wednesday. On Wednesday evening, the NBTC hinted that they would subsidize the matches in line with the junta's campaign to ""return happiness to the Thai people"" so that everyone could watch all the games on free cable at home.

fe37944176794b8e4c2310cf364f867e9fa52d9e,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Acting at the request of an air traffic controller, the pilot of a Southwest Airlines B-737 pulled within one-tenth of a mile of a small, four-seat aircraft last month to check on pilot of the smaller plane, who had not responded to radio calls, the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday. The March 27 incident was publicized days after it happened, when Federal Aviation Administrator Randy Babbitt suspended the air traffic controller, for ""compromising the safety"" of the planes' occupants. But the details released Friday for the first time show just how close the two planes came. According to the NTSB, the planes came within 0.1 miles of each other, far closer then the required separation of three miles. They also were separated by 100 feet in altitude, less than the 1,000 feet required, the NTSB reported. The incident happened 11,000 feet over central Florida, when controllers at the Central Florida TRACON, a regional radar facility, were unsuccessful in contacting the pilot of the Cirrus SR22, which was en route to Kissimmee, Florida. The plane had been out of radio contact with the Jacksonville Center for more than an hour. A TRACON controller sought the assistance of Southwest Airlines flight 821, which was then 10 miles from the smaller aircraft, asking the Southwest pilot ""to attempt to verify the condition of the occupants"" of the Cirrus, the NTSB said. The Southwest pilot ""obliged,"" and controllers guided the jetliner towards the unresponsive plane. A separate radar scope was set up and a single frequency was used by a front-line manager who provided instructions to the Southwest jet. When the Southwest jet was about five miles from the smaller plane, the pilot reported seeing the plane visually and on a collision avoidance system. The jet ""maneuvered on his own alongside of"" the smaller plane, the NTSB said. The crew reported seeing ""two occupants in the Cirrus and no apparent movement from them"" before being vectored away to its Orlando destination. The FAA said both planes landed safely. Southwest Airlines reported in March that it had suspended the pilot of the jetliner pending an investigation. Both the FAA and NTSB are investigating. Neither has issued any findings or conclusions. Aviation authorities say the protocol for intercepting unresponsive aircraft is to scramble military jets. ""By placing this passenger aircraft in close proximity to another plane, the air traffic controller compromised the safety of everyone involved,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement in March. ""This incident was totally inappropriate."" ""We are reviewing the air traffic procedures used here and making sure everyone understands the protocols for contacting unresponsive aircraft,"" Babbitt said. Southwest Airlines said the flight had 137 passengers and a crew of five.",3,5.751334479011425
0134b852198cd1f0463447397944dd90ad913b14,CNN,"(CNN) -- The ever-expanding outbreak of life-threatening fungal meningitis in back pain patients linked to steroid injections prepared by a compounding pharmacy, which so far has sickened at least 214 people and killed 15 in 15 states, is a public health catastrophe. What is particularly tragic for those who have been sickened or killed by the tainted drug and for their loved ones is that this situation was completely avoidable. Since federal laws were enacted in 1938 and 1962 giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority to ensure that all brand name and generic drugs were both safe and effective, compounding pharmacies have traditionally filled a very narrow health care niche in which they prepared, in response to physicians' prescriptions, individually tailored preparations of drugs for patients having unique medical needs that could not be met by a commercially available standard drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical company. While the FDA has long considered the compounding of drugs to be subject to FDA regulations, the agency has recognized the important health care role for such compounded medications. Therefore, it has used ""enforcement discretion"" to allow compounding pharmacies to produce these drugs without complying with FDA regulations, generally deferring regulatory oversight to state pharmacy boards. News: What is a compounding pharmacy? However over the past two decades, many so-called compounding pharmacies began large-scale production of drugs and moved from the traditionally narrow role filled by such pharmacies into a realm that clearly involved drug manufacturing and distribution of standardized drugs. In many cases, the drugs have been sold in multiple states, thus involving interstate commerce. The steroid medication linked to the current fungal meningitis outbreak was produced and widely distributed by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, one of many compounding pharmacies across the country that has crossed the line between traditional compounding and large-scale drug production. The injectable steroid medication produced at the center was never approved by the FDA and was not manufactured in accordance with the FDA's rigorous manufacturing standards designed to ensure that drugs are sterile and uncontaminated with such germs as bacteria or fungi before being sold and distributed. As a result, as many as 14,000 patients in 23 states were exposed to potentially contaminated steroids and need to be monitored for signs of fungal meningitis or other infections. Many people rightly are asking how the disastrous outbreak could happen in the United States and who is to blame. While numerous probes and investigations are just getting under way and litigation targeting the producer of the tainted drug and health care providers who used it will certainly take years to resolve, blame for this disaster will undoubtedly rest with many parties. Among them are the compounding pharmacy that produced the contaminated steroid drugs, health care facilities and providers who chose to use a dangerous drug lacking approval by the FDA and evidence that the products were sterile, trade associations and professional groups representing compounding pharmacies that have vigorously resisted federal regulatory oversight of their members, state and federal regulators, and Congress. A key player at the federal level deserving a significant amount of blame is the FDA. Loud alarm bells were sounded on December 4, 2006, when the FDA issued warning letters to the New England Compounding Center and four other compounding pharmacies, directing them to stop producing standardized versions of medications that, according to the agency, were being ""marketed for general distribution rather than responding to the unique medical needs of individual patients."" the center was cited for violations of FDA regulations in marketing four different drugs, including repackaged doses of the cancer drug Avastin into syringes for treatment of macular degeneration. News: Injectable drugs from Mass. facility suspect . Clearly, the FDA considered the center and the other compounding pharmacies to be engaged in drug manufacturing. The pharmacies, like any other drug manufacturer, were therefore subject to the safety and effectiveness standards required for approval of new drugs, as well as the rigorous manufacturing standards designed to ensure that drugs are sterile and uncontaminated with such germs as bacteria or fungi before being sold and distributed. However, following its warning letter, the FDA subsequently dropped the ball and failed to take the actions necessary to ensure the center adhered to these drug standards, which are essential for protecting the health of patients. For whatever reason, whether inattentiveness or lack of compliance and legal resources, by not aggressively enforcing the regulations related to large-scale drug manufacturing and interstate commerce, the FDA allowed the company to shift its wide-scale manufacturing and interstate distribution operation to injectable steroids. On Thursday, the FDA attempted to deflect criticism for its failures by asserting that it lacked authority to take action earlier. This flies in the face of the agency's long-stated position that it had legal authority over such activities and its prior enforcement activities against the New England center and multiple other compounding pharmacies. While no one wants to be viewed as being responsible for a preventable public health catastrophe, American citizens should express their outrage and demand that all parties responsible for this tragedy -- including the FDA -- be held accountable. Otherwise history will repeat itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Carome.",8,14.516628616178048
b724f1558d64db371545f46546e286b9051a9ba6,CNN,"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea test-fired a fourth short-range missile off its east coast Thursday, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's administration has become more aggressive in recent months. South Korea's Defense Ministry had earlier confirmed three launches, but could not immediately be reached about the fourth reported missile. The first three missiles were fired at 5:20 p.m., 6 p.m., and 7:50 p.m. local time from Sinsang-ni near the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, a ministry spokesman said. A U.S. official told CNN ""the missile firings come as no surprise."" ""The North has been carrying out provocative acts for some time,"" said the official, who did not want to be named for security reasons. ""North Korea needs to stop this type of activity and return to the process of bringing about a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" A U.S. intelligence official confirmed the test firings and said there are ""no indications whatsoever"" of an impending long-range missile test. The intelligence official, who could also not be named for security reasons, said the launches came as no surprise because North Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a ""military firing exercise,"" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN. The North issued a similar warning before testing a long-range missile in April, but that warning indicated two potential danger areas more indicative of a long-range missile test. Thursday's reported test comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. Analyst Daniel Pinkston said the reported test might be training for a future test but it could also just be a routine military exercise. ""It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch,"" said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations. ""So yes, people are watching it, the military is watching it here, but I don't think it's related to any plans or operations to attack anyone."" Russia had a low-key reaction to the reported test. Russian military experts are carefully studying the reports but the launches will not change the political situation, a spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry said.

5e37bb61bd84940334e05f1e242b826f4e9ff9a8,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates, according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country. The report, ""Fatal Flaws: Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru"" found that hundreds of poor, rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country. It also concluded that the government's response to tackling the problem was inadequate. Peruvian government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in childbirth, but the United Nations says the number is much higher, 240 per 100,000, which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the Americas. In wealthy developed nations, only nine women die for every 100,000 births. The five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, infection, complications following abortion and obstructed birth, according to Peru's Ministry of Health figures. Amnesty's Peru researcher Nuria Garcia said, in a written statement: ""The rates of maternal mortality in Peru are scandalous. The fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation. ""The Peruvian state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal health care to all women, regardless of who they are and where they live."" Garcia added: ""Health services for pregnant women in Peru are like a lottery: If you are poor and indigenous, the chances are you will always lose."" The report said pregnant women in Peru die because they lack access to emergency obstetric care, to information on maternal health, and to health staff members who can speak Indigenous languages such as Quechua -- a native Andean language spoken by some 5 million people in Peru. According to the report, 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes occurred during pregnancy; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth. A 2007 Census of Indigenous People showed that 60 percent did not have access to a health facility, said Amnesty International. The Amnesty International report notes that the Peruvian government has instituted policies aimed at reducing the rates of maternal mortality, such as increasing maternal waiting houses -- rooms where pregnant women who live far from health centers can stay. Other measures include more training for health staff members on the vertical birth method common among indigenous women and teaching the Quiche language to health professionals, Amnesty International said. But the human rights group said Peruvian women and health professionals have complained that the measures are not being implemented effectively. For example, the rights group said, even though the number of waiting houses has increased more than threefold in the past eight years, only half of them are in rural areas. The agency also contends that training for health professionals on the vertical birth method is not sufficiently widespread. According to Peru's Human Rights ombudsperson, more than 45 percent of health staff last year said they had not received appropriate training, Amnesty International said. ""Official initiatives to reduce maternal mortality are good news,"" Garcia said. ""However, lack of clear responsibilities for implementing them and the absence of effective resourcing and monitoring puts any initiative in great jeopardy."" Though Peru's rate of maternal deaths is high, it pales in comparison to sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 900 deaths for each 100,000 births, the United Nations says. For Africa as a whole, the number is 820. The highest rates were in Sierra Leone, with 2,000, and Afghanistan, with 1,900. Latin America and the Caribbean average 130 deaths per 100,000 births, the United Nations says, with the lowest rates in Chile, Costa Rica and Cuba. Worldwide, there were an average of 400 deaths for each 100,000 births in the year 2000, the United Nations says. The lowest rates were in Iceland, with zero, and Austria, with four per 100,000 births. The United States had 11 deaths per 100,000 births in 2005, the United Nations says.

faacaff064e35138470bca114eead948cdbc1749,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Online travel company Orbitz was fined $50,000 Monday by the Department of Transportation for failing to properly disclose baggage fees on its website. In announcing the fine, the DOT said it had ordered Orbitz to immediately fix the problem to avoid further fines. The agency alleged that Orbitz failed to ""clearly and prominently"" inform travelers about potential baggage fees during the airline ticket purchasing process, and in doing so, violated a new rule intended to make airline fees more transparent. ""The Department adopted its rules on baggage fees to ensure that consumers have complete and accurate information about how much they will have to pay when they book a flight, and we will continue to take enforcement action when carriers and ticket agents fail to comply with our rules,"" Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood said in a statement. While admitting that Orbitz did, in fact, post the fees online, Lahood and the DOT took issue with where the notice was placed. The agency alleged that customers were forced to scroll to the bottom of the web page to see the cost of checking their baggage. Tim Enstice, Orbitz communications manager, told CNN: ""As the order acknowledges, we promptly corrected how we displayed airline baggage fee information to be consistent with DOT's preference. We are not aware of any consumer confusion, complaints or deception over this issue, but settled the case to avoid the costs of litigation."" The rule went into place in January and mandates carriers and ticket agents disclose up-front any baggage fees passengers may have to pay in addition to the ticket price. In June, the DOT fined Mexican airline Volaris $130,000 for violating the same rule. Go to CNN.com's Travel page for tips and armchair getaways .

e927bde04257d48316f54e423505141114dae456,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Tamil National Alliance, Sri Lanka's largest Tamil political party, on Thursday called for an international inquiry into a U.N. failure to protect civilians during the final stages of the country's bloody 26-year civil war. The request comes a day after the United Nations admitted that it didn't protect hundreds of thousands of civilians, mostly ethnic Tamils, trapped in areas of heavy shelling in Sri Lanka, a teardrop-shaped island nation off India's southern coast. ""The internal inquiry report that has now come to light says the U.N. failed civilians by leaving the area,"" M.A. Sumanthiran, the Tamil National Alliance parliamentarian, told CNN. Sumanthiran was referring to the withdrawal of the U.N.'s international staff from north Sri Lanka's Wanni area. In late 2008, the government could no longer guarantee the safety of U.N. staff there because of intense fighting between its forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, an armed separatist group commonly referred to as the Tamil Tigers. As the U.N. prepared to leave, local civilians pleaded with it to stay, fearing the government would bomb areas where there were no international witnesses. In the report released Wednesday, the United Nations questioned its decision to move its staff ""because of a government safety warning when government forces themselves represented the dominant threat to staff."" The U.N. also acknowledged that it had, on occasion, ""omitted to explicitly mention government responsibility for violations of international law"" so as to not hinder its humanitarian access in the country. The internal review published accounts in which U.N. officials emphasized grave responsibility for civilian deaths with the LTTE but only ""raised concerns"" with the Sri Lankan government. The government of Sri Lanka declared victory in 2009 in its decades-long battle with the Tamil Tiger rebels, who had waged war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. As many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict. Caught in the crossfire year after year were civilians, thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed. In the war's final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni, where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left large numbers of civilians dead. In its report this week, the U.N. admitted to withholding the large number of civilian casualties it had recorded from diplomatic corps in the country. Though the United Nations says it made taciturn criticism of the government so that it could negotiate pauses in fighting to allow civilians to escape and for it to gain access to internally displaced people, the efforts were made in vain because, as Wednesday's report said, the U.N. was never in a position to reach those displaced people. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and other nongovernmental organizations. ""The report concludes that the United Nations system failed to meet its responsibilities,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Thursday. The U.N. report concludes by stating: ""The UN's failure to adequately respond to events like those that occurred in Sri Lanka should not happen again. When confronted by similar situations, the UN must be able to meet a much higher standard in fulfilling its protection and humanitarian responsibilities."" However, Sumanthiran says there is more work to be done before moving on. ""That does not mean that it is a lesson for the future for the United Nations. The United Nations should revisit the events that took place during the final stages of the war in May 2009, where both the Tamil Tiger rebels and the security forces are accused of committing war crimes,"" he said. ""If the U.N. has made a mistake, they must pursue that course of action."" The Sri Lankan government had no immediate official response to the United Nations report.

b9bfc39546a35c0bab87fc140efe45fe331c162d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is happy to stay with the English Premier League side after reported interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid. Gerrard's future was the subject of much speculation after Liverpool finished seventh last season and failed to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. The 30-year-old delayed any decision until after the World Cup, where he captained England to a disappointing second round exit at the hands of Germany. He was linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid but he has underlined his commitment to Liverpool after a private meeting with manager Roy Hodgson, who took over from Rafael Benitez earlier this month. Gerrard told Liverpool's official website: ""I made it clear that I simply needed to concentrate on the World Cup and then have a decent holiday with my family. ""I wanted the chance to meet Roy Hodgson privately and having done so I'm very impressed with his plans for the future of the team. ""I've only returned to training on Tuesday with some of the other World Cup players, but I can't wait for the new season to start."" Gerrard's declaration -- just a day after Liverpool announced the capture of England international Joe Cole -- was welcomed by Hodgson, who is also hoping to persuade Spain striker Fernando Torres to remain at the club. ""It's a great piece of news,"" Hodgson said. ""There won't be anyone in Liverpool who isn't delighted to hear that. I'm really pleased about it because I've got great respect for Steven Gerrard.

It will be a tough season, with a lot of matches and the disappointment of last season is going to take a while to dissipate, but it is very good that our best player is still going to be playing at this club. ""Hopefully with the signing of Joe Cole -- and if we are lucky one or two others, to boost the squad -- we will be going into this season's competition, maybe stronger on paper than we were last season."" Gerrard said Cole was a ""great signing"" for the club. ""I know Joe well through the England set-up and have seen first hand just how good a player he is. ""He's proved his ability over many years in the Premier League, sometimes against us - so it will be fantastic to play alongside him in a red shirt for Liverpool.

2eb3df5bc723709d3b1c00d83cee0e8ea7b0183e,CNN,"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney returned with a goal to send England through to the quarter finals of Euro 2012 as Group D winners. Rooney's second-half header saw Roy Hodgson's England leapfrog France, who crashed to a 2-0 defeat against Sweden but still limped through to the last eight. Rooney, who had missed a glorious first-half chance to break the deadlock, headed in from close range after goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov had spilled Steven Gerrard's cross. Yet the real post-match talking point centred on a call for goalline technology as co-hosts Ukraine saw a Marko Devic shot apparently cross the line before being scrambled away by John Terry. It was a cruel end to Ukraine's tournament and a lucky break for England, who held on to secure a quarter-final clash with Italy while France face Spain. England 1-0 Ukraine . The co-hosts needed a win to progress and made a positive start. But while Ukraine undoubtedly dominated the first half, it was England who had the best chance of the opening 45 minutes. John Terry picked out Ashley Young with a fantastic cross-field pass and Young's centre expertly picked out the run of his Manchester United team-mate Rooney, only for the striker to plant his header harmlessly wide. To say Rooney looked rusty on his return would be a huge understatement. His touch was poor and so was his hold-up play, betraying his absence from the tournament so far, but his movement off the ball remained encouraging for Hodgson's side. But it was not just their returning striker who struggled for England; their general play was sloppy and Ukraine's greater urgency and desire meant they bossed the game. Right-back Oleg Husyev displayed plenty of the attacking instinct that he shows on the right wing for Dynamo Kiev and caused Ashley Cole and England all sorts of anxieties. But, for all their intent, Ukraine failed to create any real threat to Joe Hart's goal. Instead, it was England who took control of the game three minutes into the second half -- and this time Rooney's movement paid handsome dividends. Captain Gerrard created the opening, cutting inside and hitting a firm cross that clipped off Selin and Khacheridi to send the ball squirming out of goalkeeper Pyatov's grasp and allow Rooney to run free and head home from close range. On the hour, Ukraine wasted a glorious chance to level when Andriy Yarolenko's searching cross found Milevskiy, who appeared offside but managed to plant his header over the bar from close range. Two minutes later, the co-hosts were controversially denied an equaliser when Milevsky set up Devic, whose shot was parried well by Hart but looped up and goalwards. John Terry raced back and acrobatically hooked away, though the effort looked to have clearly crossed the line. There was still time for Hart to spectacularly palm away Konoplyanka's shot, the impressive Joleon Lescott scrambling the loose ball clear, as England weathered the co-hosts' storm to climb to the top of Group D. Upwards and onwards. France 0-2 Sweden . Second-half goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Sebastian Larsson saw Sweden end their Euro 2012 campaign with victory, but Erik Hamren's side still finished rock-bottom of the group as France limped through as group runners-up. The Swedes, beaten by Ukraine and England in their opening two games, dominated the first half and were unlucky not to take the lead when Philippe Mexes' slip let in Ola Toivonen who rounded keeper Hugo Lloris but shot against the outside of the post from a tight angle. Larsson shot over the crossbar as Sweden threatened again but they finally took a deserved lead on 54 minutes when Ibrahimovic spectacularly volleyed home following another spell of pressure. Captain Lloris kept France in contention when he beat away a Wilhelmsson cross and, from the resulting corner, twisted spectacularly to tip over Olof Mellberg's close range flick. That finally prompted a spell of French pressure, but the closest they came was a Karim Benzema shot that dragged across the face of goal as Sweden comfortably held on. In fact, the Swedes doubled their money in the closing minutes to complete a deserved win. Samuel Holmen scuffed his shot, but the effort bounced back off the crossbar and fell invitingly for Larsson to smash home with another spectacular Swedish finish. Ukraine's defeat meant that France still reached the last eight, where they will now face European champions Spain.",7,8.927090200527973

The show's ""big success"" is ""due in part"" to Trump, Bob Greenblatt said, but he predicts it can go on without him. ""If he decides to run for president and is unavailable to do the show, we will bring the show back and there will be somebody else sitting at the head of the boardroom table,"" NBC's Bob Greenblatt said. ""Who that is, we're not even going to really entertain because I'm still hoping we will have Donald in the seat."" Trump, who has flirted with a 2012 presidential bid, is expected to make his intentions known on the final episode of the reality show's current season. NBC has enjoyed a ratings bump from the Trump presidential buzz, Greenblatt said. ""We couldn't be happier,"" he said. ""There may be headaches down the road but at the moment we're feeling really good about it."" While he wants Trump to be available to host ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" Greenblatt said, ""It is the right and privilege for every American-born citizen in this country to run for the highest office in the land.

a1d2363333c8824ffe410f75f3e6c8b924d3eb97,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, UK has acquired two models of the world's first 3D-printed gun. The 'Liberator' pistol is the invention of Cody Wilson, a Texan law student whose company Defense Distributed caused a furore in May when it made blueprints for its firearm freely available on the internet. The distribution of the designs led to Wired magazine naming Wilson as one of the '15 Most dangerous People in the World'. In theory, once downloaded, the designs would allow anyone with access to a 3D printer to make their own gun. Video shows test firing of 3-D printed handgun . A few days after Wilson conducted his first successful test of the pistol, the U.S. government forced Defense Distributed to take the plans down. Wilson complied, but not before the design had been downloaded over 100,000 times. The V&A museum has two copies of the Liberator pistol on display as part of London Design Week. The two prototypes on display -- one extant and one disassembled to show its components -- are part of a new collection of 3D objects. According to the curators, the guns ""represent a turning point in debates around digital manufacturing."" The Science Museum in London also has a Liberator on display. In an interview with CNN, Wilson said that he felt the museum's curators appreciated the Liberator pistol as a design object, but also appreciated the political ideas the weapon conveyed. ""The curators of the museum's digital collection understand Liberator and our other pieces are first and foremost articles of political thought-practice,"" Wilson said. Wilson says that in his view 3D printing is still in its infancy, and that it will become more significant in the future: ""I see digital manufacturing playing a bigger role in our lives."" While he thought that the mainstream firearms industry is no longer as powerful as it once was, Wilson said he thought that the spread of weaponry will gradually increase, and that in future it will be easy for almost anyone to get a gun: ""I think gun-making culture is on an understandable decline, but the barrier to entry to this culture will be lowered."" U.S. requires group to remove 3-D gun instructions from its website . Considering it as a design object, Wilson believes that the Liberator's unusual shape has been part of its success: ""Looking back, I would change nothing of the design. It was curious, boxy, alien. Its strangeness allowed it a better examination -- both as an article of design and as a concept."" Alongside the 3D printed gun, the museum also acquired four other items which point to the future of design, including a homemade toaster constructed from odds and ends for just $6 and a futuristic armchair with elongated ""ears"" to create an artificial private space. 3-D printed guns a boon for criminals? All the items were bought through the Design Fund to Benefit the V&A. Martin Roth, the museum's director, said: ""The generosity of supporters of the Design Fund ensures that the V&A is able to acquire for our permanent collections some of the best and most exciting design projects of our time. ""This year's acquisitions reflect an interesting combination of new technologies working with traditional crafts."" NASA sending 3-D printer into space .",6,10.851172548630775
5ce01f0eb8b2664c49d79dbb329d7b62113cf5c9,CNN,"London (CNN) -- Never mind the traffic, car owners in London have a new hazard to worry about: A skyscraper whose reflected rays have the power to melt cars. It may sound like science fiction, but it was no joke for Jaguar XJ owner Martin Lindsay, who parked his pricey ride near the under-construction building, officially called 20 Fenchurch Street, but known by many Londoners as the ""Walkie Talkie"" for its distinctive shape. Watch more: Does this skyscraper melt cars? When he returned to the car, he found some panels warped beyond repair by the beam of light reflected down from the curved side of the landmark glass tower. The developers of the 37-floor building, Canary Wharf and Land Securities, have said they'll pay for the high-spec vehicle to be fixed. ""Canary Wharf Construction and Land Securities have been very good and agreed to pay for the damage, and accept that there is an issue which they will resolve,"" Lindsay told CNN. ""I am in construction and sometimes things go wrong which nobody would have envisaged, and this is one of them."" The City A.M. newspaper said light reflected from the building had also previously damaged a van parked on the same street, Eastcheap. A joint statement from Land Securities and Canary Wharf said they were taking the issue of light reflecting from the building seriously. ""The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky. It currently lasts for approximately 2 hours per day, with initial modeling suggesting that it will be present for approximately 2-3 weeks,"" it said. The developers have been in touch with local businesses and have arranged with local authorities for three parking spaces which may be affected to be suspended, it said. ""In addition, we are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short-term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future."" 20 Fenchurch Street, designed by architect Rafael ViÃ±oly, will feature about 33,000 square meters of glass -- an area equivalent to more than 4.5 soccer pitches -- once complete. It's not the only building reportedly to have directed scorching light onto the ground below. The Las Vegas Review-Journal said in 2010 that the glass-sided Vdara Hotel in Las Vegas was reflecting a ray of light so intense that it scorched the hair of a visitor using the hotel's pool, as well as melting a hole in a plastic bag he had by his sun lounger. Hotel pool employees called the phenomenon the ""Vdara death ray,"" the newspaper reported. A spokesman for the hotel's owner told the paper it was working on design solutions.

31e81b1f86ef31f92c1b4d52c003ac469d12f1e4,CNN,"(CNN) -- After hours of back and forth between members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America decided Friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in ""lifelong"" and ""monogamous"" same-sex relationships. Previous Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy, lay people to serve only if celibate. One of the country's largest Protestant denominations, the Lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality. While the recommendations passed at the weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, do not address recognizing same-sex marriage or civil unions, they do allow congregations to support same-sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same-sex relationships to hold clergy positions. The previous policy of the 4.6-million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate. Some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings. ""Brothers and sisters, I ask you, before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole, if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin,"" said the Rev. Steven Frock of the Western Iowa Synod. Among those on the other side was Alan Wold of the Northern Illinois Synod. ""If according to some I am going to be in err for supporting this... Let me err on the side of mercy, grace, justice, and love of neighbor. Let me err on the side of gospel, which makes all things new."" Many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church. So the members voted to re-order their resolutions -- moving to the top a resolution that the church ""commit itself to bear one another's burdens, love thy neighbor, and respect the bound consciences of all."" It passed with overwhelming support. Other religious denominations, including Episcopalians and Unitarians, have made moves to accept gay clergy, and Evangelical Lutherans would not be the first to accept those openly in same-sex relationships, said David Masci, a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. But ELCA would be the largest to make such a move. The church is the third largest Protestant denomination, representing 2 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Forum. The battle Friday was the latest in what Masci said many ""socially moderate"" denominations, including those in Judaism, are grappling with: balancing the growing acceptance of same-sex relationships with traditional teachings. As some have moved toward accepting same-sex relationships, within those same denominations ""you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it,"" said Masci. On hand for Friday's debate were hundreds of ""interested parties"" -- including some people who are not members of the church, said John Brooks, ELCA spokesman. When asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site, he responded, ""Interestingly, no."" In the convention hall, Brooks said, ""The debates haven't been rancorous or mean-spirited in any way. They've been quite civil. But people have been passionate with their feelings."" The Rev. Terri Stagner-Collier of the Southeastern Synod said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church. Her sister ""felt her church was being ripped away from her,"" Stagner-Collier said tearfully, adding, I urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family."" Sara Gross of the Oregon Synod said some ""dear members"" of the church will be lost if the resolution passes. But, she said, ""A vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying 'not all are welcome.'"" In a ""changing world,"" Gross argued, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America ""needs to be a voice that stands up and says 'yes.'""

78ab06fc69d8b8179b83fa4703be6eab72fbe856,CNN,"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan looked likely Sunday to win the election, a CNN tally of preliminary results showed. The Independent National Electoral Commission posted on its website the count from 28 of the country's 36 states and its capital, showing Jonathan with more than 19 million votes, compared to his main challenger -- Muhammadu Buhari -- who had close to 9 million votes. A formal announcement of the results could come as early as Monday. To avoid a runoff, Jonathan must get at least a quarter of the vote in two-thirds of the 36 states and the capital. Nigerians voted Saturday for their president, a week after parliamentary elections were marred by violence and accusations of fraud in Africa's most populous nation. Jonathan is the front-runner despite a poor performance in those elections by his People's Democratic Party. He is popular in the Christian and animist south. The former vice president assumed office after President Umaru Yar'Adua died last year following treatment for a kidney ailment in Saudi Arabia. Jonathan has led the nation of about 150 million people since May. About 73 million people were registered to vote. His main challenger, Buhari, is a former military ruler and was a contestant in the 2003 and 2007 elections. He is the candidate for the Congress for Progressive Change and enjoys support from the mostly Muslim north. Other candidates included Nuhu Ribadu and current Kano state Gov. Ibrahim Shekarau. A CNN iReporter in Lagos, who gave her name as Jan Young, said Saturday she expected the race to be tight. ""If the incumbent president wins, it won't be a landslide victory but a fair split between the ruling and opposition parties who campaigned for our votes. I also expect our nation would demand accountability from whoever wins at the end of the day,"" she wrote. Saturday's voting was largely peaceful, in contrast to the violence that characterized the country's parliamentary elections on April 9. During that vote, separate bomb blasts ripped through a polling station and a collation center in northeastern Nigeria. Human Rights Watch has estimated that at least 85 people have been killed in political violence so far. A new election chief promised free and fair elections, but the electoral commission was forced to put off elections earlier this year by a week after logistical problems, including party logos missing from ballot papers, were reported nationwide. It was a major setback reminiscent of the nation's 2007 elections, which the European Union described as filled with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and hosts many Western oil companies and workers. Nigerians voted April 9 for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. A gubernatorial vote will be held on April 26.",7,7.666660503853657
d2de630ddb244a7ba8acc20c7f2c79168ab5f914,CNN,"(CNN) -- For the first time in several weeks, authorities have released information about missing Malaysia Flight 370 not previously available to the public. The problem is, it's very technical and experts said it's going to take them weeks to figure out exactly what it means. On Tuesday the Malaysian authorities published a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the airliner that went missing March 8 and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company. Is there anything in the data we didn't already know? The data is dense and complicated, and even professionals will need time to analyze the logs, experts tell CNN. But there is some key general information that has emerged. The data includes the seven ""handshakes"" investigators said helped them conclude that the plane ended its flight in the southern Indian Ocean, where the search continues. ""Handshake"" is the lingo that Inmarsat uses. It means a signal between the satellite and the plane. The satellite sends a coded signal to the plane essentially asking ""Are you there?"" and the plane sends a signal conveying ""I am here."" Remember it was Malaysian authorities who, in late March, told relatives of the 239 passengers and crew that the aircraft crashed in the southern Indian ocean. The Malaysian government's decided to release the data now, said Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce on CNN's ""New Day."" The data constitutes ""raw communications logs over our networks,"" he said. ""That's all the information that we have that passed between our network and the plane during the fateful hours when the flight was lost,"" Pearce said. ""So it's everything -- we put everything out there."" Speaking of handshakes, what's this about a 'partial handshake'? Inmarsat and Australian officials have addressed something they call a ""margin of error"" -- or how far the plane could be from the location where authorities believe it crashed. The focus of the search has been the so-called seventh arc, which represents the location of a ""partial handshake."" Authorities believe that area is where the plane ran out of fuel. When it ran out of fuel, the plane's on-board satellite communications system stopped, and the ""partial handshake"" was the battery-powered communication's equipment powering up following a power interruption, authorities said. Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating the search, first suggested at a press conference in early April that may have happened. You've said it's going to take time -- how long exactly? An international group of experts is reviewing the data from Inmarsat and examining an analysis of the plane's performance -- and that enterprise could take two to three more weeks, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan told CNN Tuesday. On top of that, it's possible that continuing to review the data will further refine or even shift the search area from its current location, Dolan told CNN. It's not just people involved in the search saying that. Even Michael Exner, founder of American Mobile Satellite Corporation, a member of a loose confederation of experts who've demanded access to the information, said the information released Tuesday is too limited to verify Inmarsat's conclusion that the plane flew south, into the Indian Ocean. He joined the chorus of others who called for more time. But don't the Australians, the leaders of the search, have anything more to say? For the first time, Australian accident investigators outlined in a detailed report why they believe the plane crashed in the southern Indian ocean. The report, posted Monday on the ATSB's website, includes a map with seven concentric circles representing the ""seven handshakes"" captured in the Inmarsat data. This is where aviation experts -- who call themselves av geeks -- can begin their inside baseball debate. To start them off -- the Australians' report explains two key measurements: The first, the Burst Timing Offset (BTO), which allowed investigators to figure out how far away the plane was from the satellite at the time of each ""handshake."" The second, the Burst Frequency Offset (BFO), which helped investigators estimate the speed and direction of the aircraft, which led to the conclusion that MH370 flew into the southern Indian Ocean. You've probably seen family members on the news, outraged at the Malaysian government, accusing officials of not being transparent during the investigation. How are relatives reacting to the release of this data? ""It is very technical and we are not experts, so we may ask some other people who can help us,"" said Steven Wang on CNN Tuesday. His mother was a passenger. Sarah Bajc, partner of American passenger Philip Wood, told CNN's ""New Day"" that she believes Malaysian authorities have more information they're not releasing. She suggested that the Malaysian government received the data from Inmarsat and manipulated it before releasing it to the public. ""They're clearly covering something up,"" she said. ""Now, whether they're covering up their own incompetence or they're covering up wrongdoing or they're covering up on behalf of somebody else, for instance another more powerful government, it could be any of those scenarios."" She said that the families have reached out to their own hired experts who are analyzing the data, but that it is too soon to tell if they can draw any conclusions.",6,7.930963584690983
59240a4aefd6b5f0b0e0c7ffe791ca1b6b86e385,CNN,"London (CNN) -- Microsoft's popular Kinect for Xbox 360 has inspired countless ingenious ""hacks"" since its launch at the end of 2010. The motion-sensing device has been modified to produce everything from real-time light sabers to nifty trash bins which catch your garbage (however bad your aim), proving a catalyst for creativity and invention. Today, Kinect's reach extends far beyond its gaming origins, spurring advances in medical treatment. Researchers at the UK's University of Southampton, for example, are using the technology to help patients recovering from a stroke. A specially devised algorithm enables therapists to remotely track patients' hand and finger movements and guide them through exercises which compliment a wider program of physiotherapy. ""It widens our opportunities to make rehabilitation more accessible to people in their homes,"" says Cheryl Metcalf, lecturer in Biomechanics at Southampton. ""(Patients) can just plug it into their TV and be monitored over the internet,"" she said. ""The whole tele-medicine idea opens up so many different avenues to be able to look and measure progress objectively."" Aided by electrical engineering company Roke Manor Research, Metcalf and colleagues have created a prototype which is currently being assessed against the traditional laboratory-based system. It's an accessible technology which people are more willing to accept, says Metcalf, and Microsoft have been very supportive. ""We're very grateful to them for releasing the (Kinect for Windows) SDK (software development kit) and making it more accessible to people,"" she said. See also: 3-D printing: the shape of things to come . The kit has been a hit with developers with downloads in the ""hundreds of thousands"" since its release 18 months ago, according to Microsoft. The company itself has been busy looking at ways to exploit the technology through its network of research laboratories around the world. At Microsoft Research's UK base in Cambridge, scientists are currently trialing a new imaging tool for surgeons. ""Touchless Interaction in Medical Imaging"" gives surgeons the power to manipulate scans and medical images on a computer screen using hand gestures. Doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and London's St Thomas' Hospital have been impressed with the equipment, says Helena Mentis, one of the Microsoft Research team working on the project. ""They've all been extremely excited to be able to have hands-on manipulation of imaging data that they are so reliant on, particularly with the push towards minimally invasive surgery,"" Mentis said. Watch video: Hands-free browsing using Kinect . Dr Tom Carrell, vascular surgeon at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, says Kinect has the potential to radically change surgery. ""With Kinect, we could revolutionize the way we do complex operations. Patients will spend less time in theater, and surgeons will be more in control of the information they need,"" Carrell said in a statement. Kinect's influence could extend further says Mentis, manipulating 3-D models of the brain for neurosurgery and expanding touchless interaction into a whole suite of surgical tools. Back in Southampton, the same optimism persists about the progress that can be made using Kinect for Windows. Metcalf predicts that a commercially viable tool for stroke patients will be achieved within five years and that this flurry of activity is only the beginning. ""The other work that's going on around the world in different domains means we can all learn from each other as well,"" she said. ""It just pushes the whole field forward.""",6,7.176607477508181

6dc8c6767199e7b2a2c056ef788e2eadc5fa1e2c,CNN,"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- Seven teachers were kidnapped Thursday from Pakistan's volatile tribal Khyber Agency for having supported a polio vaccination campaign, an official told CNN Saturday. ""They were not the polio workers, but they had been picked up by the unknown kidnappers for allowing polio vaccination in their school, Hira Public School,"" said Nasir Khan, the assistant political agent of Bara Teshil of Khyber Agency. ""They were not directly related to polio vaccination, but had supported the workers as volunteers during the recent vaccination drive, and that's why they had been kidnapped,"" he added. Khidmat Kalaq Foundation, a local charity that runs the school, and a jirga led by a tribal elder were in talks to resolve the issue, he said. The school is in the Sipah area of Bara District in the Federally Administered Tribal Area. According to an official who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified, a three-day anti-polio campaign had ended Friday. The World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration said Saturday that the kidnapped teachers did not appear to have been involved in a polio vaccination campaign, as original reports suggested. ""We don't have anything to corroborate that whatsoever,"" Dr. Bruce Aylward told CNN in a telephone interview from Geneva, citing his contacts in the country who have spoken with people in the area where the abductions occurred. ""What we have heard is that that's not the case."" At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency; law and order problems in Bara have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease, which has been declared eradicated from adjacent India. Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants here since U.S. intelligence used a fake vaccination program to help in its hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad. Since July 2012, at least 22 polio workers have been killed. The polio campaign has a history of controversy in Pakistan. Some mullahs have preached against it, claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves Pakistani children sterile. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, remains endemic only in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After its case count spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 198 in 2011 to 58 in 2012 but that progress has stopped: Pakistan is the only one of the three countries where polio is endemic to see its numbers go up this year, WHO's Aylward said. As of November 19, it has seen 63 cases this year versus 54 cases as of that date last year, he said. A second concern is spread of the infectious viral disease from Pakistan to other parts of the world -- cases diagnosed this year in Afghanistan have been linked directly to virus from Pakistan, he said.

34d1897e9ca1b824a583c850a8faa82fe8d88dc6,CNN,"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will this week make her first visit to South Sudan, a nation barely one year old that is locked in a bitter dispute with its northern neighbor, as part of a six-country tour of Africa. Clinton sets off Tuesday on the 11-day trip, which is intended to emphasize U.S. efforts to strengthen democracy, encourage economic growth and further peace and security in Africa, Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement Monday. The visit begins in Senegal, a small country on Africa's west coast that has been an outpost of democratic stability in a region with a history of electoral chaos, civil wars and coups. Despite outbreaks of violence in Senegal earlier this year surrounding former President Abdoulaye Wade's decision to seek a controversial third term in office, power passed peacefully to the eventual victor in the presidential election, Macky Sall. Clinton will meet with Sall and ""deliver a speech applauding the resilience of Senegal's democratic institutions and highlighting America's approach to partnership,"" Nuland said. The secretary of state will then travel to one of the tensest areas of Africa: South Sudan, which has edged close to full-scale war with Sudan, the nation from which it separated in July 2011 after decades of bloody conflict. The two African countries still disagree over the demarcation of the border between them and the transportation and processing of oil from South Sudan, which obtained around 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent. The U.N. Security Council is pressuring the countries to find a peaceful resolution of the disputes. Border clashes have displaced at least 150,000 people and created a huge humanitarian crisis. While in South Sudan, Clinton will meet President Salva Kiir in order to ""reaffirm U.S. support and to encourage progress in negotiations with Sudan to reach agreement on issues related to security, oil and citizenship,"" Nuland said. Clinton's next stop is Uganda, where the authorities are dealing with an outbreak of the highly infectious Ebola virus that has killed at least 14 people this month. Uganda is ""a key U.S. partner in promoting regional security, particularly in regard to Somalia and in regional efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army,"" Nuland said. A highly effective celebrity-backed social media campaign earlier this year by the nonprofit group Invisible Children focused worldwide attention on the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, the fugitive warlord Joseph Kony. The African Union has stepped up efforts this year to capture Kony, deploying 5,000 troops in March after a resurgence in attacks by his forces displaced thousands of people in Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to U.N. estimates. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations of his vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army. President Barack Obama ordered 100 troops to central Africa last year to help in the hunt for Kony. The troops are advising regional forces.

He was 56. Billy Powell, center, poses with other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2006. Powell, who died early Wednesday, had survived the band's October 1977 plane crash in Mississippi that killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. Powell was seriously injured in the crash. More than 40 fans left messages on a fan Web site. ""Billy, you are truely free now. Rock on with Ronnie and the gang. You also will be forever missed,"" read a note signed by traceyspruill. ""I cannot believe the hurt that I have felt from being a Skynyrd fan, but I realize that it only hurts so much because I love the members of this band like my own family. We will always miss you, Billy. I can hear your fingertips rolling off those ivory keys right now. Thanks for being you. Rest in peace and may God bless you,"" another fan wrote. According to Orange Park Police Lt. Mark Cornett, Powell called 911 around midnight Tuesday from his condo at the Club Continental, complaining about chest pains. ""When paramedics and police arrived, they found him unresponsive on the bed,"" Cornett said. Powell was pronounced dead at the scene, and his cardiologist signed the death certificate at 1:52 a.m. ET Wednesday. According to the officer, Powell missed an appointment with the same doctor on Tuesday. Powell joined the original Skynyrd band in 1972, but he worked for the Jacksonville, Florida-based band for several years before that as a crew member. Among the Southern rock band's acclaimed songs are ""What's Your Name,"" ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" all released in the 1970s. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" reached the top 10 in 1974. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Two years after the plane crash, Powell, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington and Leon Wilkeson formed the Rossington-Collins Band. It broke up in 1982. A new Lynyrd Skynyrd band formed in 1987 and included Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's brother. It began a tour in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the plane was headed when it crashed. The band's last album, ""Vicious Cycle,"" came out in 2003.",2,9.220897461210583
3abad9e3ce985054eb793c0857da286c96c48b8c,CNN,"(CNN) -- HTC is dipping its toes in the camera market with the new Re: a supersimple handheld action camera that pairs with a smartphone. The L-shaped Re camera looks like an inhaler or small periscope. Just under 4 inches high, the waterproof gadget is mostly handle. It turns on when you grip it and features a fixed ultra-wide-angle lens, a single button and no viewfinder. It captures 16 megapixel still images and shoots 1080p HD videos at 30 frames per second or 720p videos at 120 frames per second. Though it works independently, the Re does a lot more when used with its Android or iOS apps. The apps can turn a smartphone into a viewfinder and make it possible to shoot time-lapse and slow motion videos. Why is HTC, traditionally a smartphone company, making a camera? In a way, all smartphone makers are already in the camera industry. Starting with Apple's iPhone, smartphone manufacturers have mostly obliterated the point-and-shoot by putting powerful cameras in everyone's pocket. Part of the problem was that traditional pocket cameras just couldn't catch up fast enough with the editing and instant sharing features smartphones offered. HTC is approaching its camera from a different angle: It's built as a phone accessory. Though aimed at a more casual user, Re is similar to the many portable action cameras available. Led by the hugely popular GoPro, action cameras have taken off in recent years. Rugged and powerful, they can be mounted on vehicles, heads and animals for intense videos. Like GoPro, the Re will have a line of custom mounts and clips. It can shoot up to 1 meter underwater. HTC says the camera will be available before the end of the year and cost $199. It comes in white, navy and red. The Taiwanese company announced the new camera on Wednesday, along with the Desire Eye smartphone. Built to capitalize on the selfie craze, the Desire Eye puts its most powerful camera on the front side of the phone, so people can get the highest quality image of their face and make sure they look good at the same time.",6,6.331053679298058

Those infected have no history of recent international travel, the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday, ""so exposure was likely from local mosquitoes."" The cases were reported in two southeastern Florida counties: Martin and Miami-Dade. Dengue acquired from local mosquitoes is rare in the United States, Florida health officials said, urging residents to take steps such as wearing repellent to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say dengue rarely occurs in the United States.

f03dc8199916fcf5577df5c8c8c3aacfdc225c81,CNN,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- The Chinese women's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during this year's Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, the International Gymnastics Federation said Wednesday. Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner  He Kexin was only 14 years old. The federation said it has concluded its inquiry into the matter after it confirmed the gymnasts' ages through official documents that the Chinese Gymnasts Association provided. The documents included passports, identity cards and household registers. However, the organization intends to further investigate the ages of two gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who participated in the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia. The federation said it did not consider  the explanations and evidence that Chinese authorities provided in regard to those athletes as satisfactory. The International Olympic Committee had asked gymnastics officials to clarify the situation after numerous commentators, bloggers and others questioned whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete.  Watch tiny gymnasts work out » . Athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place. In women's gymnastics, younger girls can have an advantage over older competitors on account of their often smaller, lighter and more agile bodies. The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Beijing games, and five members won individual medals. One of the challenges came from a blogger known as ""Stryde Hax."" The blogger claimed to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14. In Internet searches, ""Stryde Hax"" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. CNN was not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appeared to back up the claim. Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994. The International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct. Chinese gymnastics coaches also defended their team. ""Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,"" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams, referring to media inquiries. ""They shouldn't be suspicious.""",7,9.357202850108035
49016a64b2b570788a86b698719a0896ce1ee588,CNN,"(CNN)  -- President Obama has ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA-backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001. In an exclusive, CNN talked with President Obama in Ghana about his order to review alleged deaths of Taliban. ""The indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention,"" Obama told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview during the president's visit to Ghana. The full interview will air 10 p.m. Monday. ""So what I've asked my national security team to do is to collect the facts for me that are known, and we'll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up,"" Obama said. The inquiry stems from the deaths of at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners who had surrendered to the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The fighters were in the custody of troops led by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Afghan warlord who has served as chief of staff of the country's post-Taliban army. Dostum, a former communist union boss and militia leader who fought against the U.S.-backed mujahedeen in the 1980s, is known for switching sides as Afghanistan's political conflict has evolved. When the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, Dostum sided with the Americans and received military and CIA support to battle the Taliban. The allegations against him first surfaced in a 2002 Newsweek report, which cited a confidential U.N. memo saying the prisoners died in cramped container trucks while being transported from their Konduz stronghold in northern Afghanistan to Sheberghan prison, west of Dostum's stronghold at Mazar-e Sharif. At the time, the Boston, Massachusetts-based group Physicians for Human Rights said it found a mass grave in nearby Dasht-e Leili, where witnesses said the bodies of Taliban prisoners were buried. The finding prompted U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks, who led the invasion of Afghanistan, to support an investigation into the allegations. But The New York Times, citing government officials and human rights organizations, reported Friday that the Bush administration ""repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode."" State Department officials recently have tried to derail Dostum's reappointment as military chief of staff to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the newspaper reported, citing several senior officials who suggested the administration ""might not be hostile to an inquiry."" Dostum, a key ally of Karzai, was reportedly living in exile in Turkey until last month, when he was reinstated to his post as defense minister. He had left Afghanistan over allegations that he had kidnapped Akbar Bai, a former ally turned political rival. When asked by CNN about whether Obama would support an investigation, the president replied, ""I think that, you know, there are responsibilities that all nations have, even in war. And if it appears that our conduct in some way supported violations of laws of war, then I think that, you know, we have to know about that.""  Watch part of CNN's exclusive interview with the president » . Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, on Sunday praised Obama ""for ordering his national security team to collect all the facts in the Dasht-e-Leili massacre and apparent U.S. cover-up."" ""U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating jointly and accepted the surrender of the prisoners jointly with General Dostum's forces in northern Afghanistan,"" Sirkin said earlier in the week. ""The Obama administration has a legal obligation to determine what U.S. officials knew, where U.S. personnel were, what involvement they had, and the actions of US allies during and after the massacre. These questions, nearly eight years later, remain unanswered.""",1,7.396403569081771
16b16347f32ae745a70cf55121ec294b1d37c07c,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Community organization ACORN is fighting back after allegations that it is trying to register voters fraudulently and to swing the presidential election for Democrat Barack Obama. ACORN Executive Director Steve Kest announces the group's lawsuits and television spot Wednesday. The group this week released a 30-second TV ad calling on Republican candidate John McCain to stop ""attempts at voter suppression across the country."" It also said it was filing several lawsuits around the country to halt the alleged suppression. Republicans have ""challenged election officials, and they've filed lawsuits in an effort to thwart these new voters -- our citizens -- from casting their votes on Tuesday. This effort must be stopped,"" Delaware ACORN board member Hugh Alleyne said during a news conference Wednesday.  Watch ACORN, conservatives spar » . ACORN contends it tried to help authorities head off election fraud. ""In nearly every case that has been reported, it was ACORN that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities, putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious, encouraging election officials to investigate, and offering to help with prosecutions,"" ACORN said in an October 9 news release. On Friday, a Pennsylvania judge rejected state Republican Party demands to obtain lists of voters registered by ACORN. The judge, Robert Simpson, said the Pennsylvania Republicans failed to convince him of the need for a preliminary injunction that would have required immediate action in the final days before the election. The state GOP accuses ACORN of widespread fraud in helping register some 140,000 voters in Pennsylvania. ""This kind of manufactured crisis is masking [Republican] efforts to keep voters from voting,"" ACORN spokeswoman Ali Kronley told CNN. The top lawyer representing the Pennsylvania Republicans said they were ""disappointed."" But, Heather Heidelbaugh added, the wording of the court order indicates the judge thinks ACORN has problems. Simpson said he would favor ""expedited discovery"" should someone want to pursue ""evidence that in Pennsylvania practices of ACORN Outreach Workers can encourage duplicate voter registration."" In Lake County, Indiana, nearly half of the 5,000 registrations ACORN submitted in early October were not good. Indiana's Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita has requested a criminal investigation, and federal law enforcement officials are considering whether to open a federal investigation based on state reports. During the October 15 presidential debate, McCain said ACORN ""may be destroying the fabric of American democracy."" Officials for ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- calls such statements hysteria, but acknowledge that some of their hires have turned in improper voter registrations. On its Web site, the group contends that those employees were lazy and didn't want to work for their pay, making ACORN, not the public, the victim. Those workers have been fired and some even prosecuted, and the false registrations have not led to voter fraud, the group contends. ""Even the general counsel of the RNC [Republican National Committee] has acknowledged that he cannot cite a single example of an improper vote having been cast as a result of alleged voter registration fraud,"" ACORN Executive Director Steve Kest said. Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, who headed up President Bush's 2004 campaign in Ohio, has said that Obama once was an organizer and trainer for ACORN. Obama's campaign says that's not true. As an attorney, Obama represented ACORN alongside the U.S. Justice Department in suing the state of Illinois to force state compliance with a federal voting access law, the campaign's Web site says. And ACORN was not involved in Project Vote, a voter registration drive that Obama ran in Illinois in 1992, according to the Web site. ACORN, founded in 1970, calls itself ""the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."" It says it has more than 400,000 member families organized into more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in 110 cities. Besides voter registration, the group focuses on issues such as predatory lending, minimum wage and funding for public schools, according to the Web site. It also provides free tax-return preparation for low-income people and screening for state and federal benefit programs. Republican hostility for ACORN goes back a long way. Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said the Bush administration fired him and eight other federal prosecutors in 2006 for political reasons, among them his refusal to pursue election fraud charges against organizations like ACORN. ""It's easy to make accusations, but ultimately a prosecutor has to prove that case beyond a reasonable doubt in federal court,"" Iglesias said. Officials with the McCain campaign maintain that the dumping of thousands of phony registrations on local election boards makes it harder for those boards to do their job, opening the door to voter fraud on Election Day.

68ce525e1db342d28d2c2239af833a1a1a68af6d,CNN,"(CNN) -- You wouldn't necessarily expect a blockbuster exhibition on women's clothing to open with a giant image of a naked lady. But step inside London's Design Museum and you'll find Eve in all her unclothed glory, hand clasped around an apple before the first bite that sends the rest of us grasping for cover. We've been dressing ourselves ever since, say the curators of ""Women Power Fashion,"" a show chronicling how women have used clothing to empower themselves -- from Joan of Arc's criminally short tunics, to Joan Collins' eye-gouging shoulder pads in Dynasty. ""This isn't an exhibition about fashion, despite the fact that we use 'fashion' in the title,"" said co-curator Colin McDowell, rather cryptically, at the opening. ""It's about clothes and how women have used them to empower themselves, to intimidate people, and to make them feel sexy."" Gaze beyond Eve's naked form and you'll find the black sequined dress given to Princess Diana on her 36th birthday, and a baby-blue two-piece worn by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after becoming leader of her party. Indeed, what really brings this exhibition to life is not simply the lovingly preserved garments -- but imagining influential women wearing them in a very different world. ""We wanted to look at how fashion mirrors what's going on in society,"" explained co-curator Donna Loveday. ""As women's roles changed over decades, so did what they wore."" Among the vast collection of painfully rigid 19th century corsets, battered broad-brimmed hats worn by the Suffragettes, and towering Manolo Blahnik stilettos, are the personally selected outfits of 26 modern-day movers and shakers. The simple trousers, jacket, silk blouse, and red and white striped scarf owned by Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo may not immediately appear eye-catching -- but it has a special emotional pull. ""This scarf is my lucky charm, it's the one I wore on the evening I won the election for Mayor of Paris"" explained Hidalgo, the first woman to have job, and one who cites former U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton as a role model. ""How one dresses is very important,"" she said at the official exhibition opening, herself clad in a sleek black leather jacket. ""The garment is the presentation of ourselves to others. It's a world in which we have some authority. And by definition, women are considered as not having authority, as being powerless."" Among the faceless mannequins draped in clothes usually worn by some of the most influential women in the world, is a sweeping white satin Prada cape owned by celebrity architect Zaha Hadid. The Iraqi-born British architect also designed the exhibition, creating a maze of mirrors and lime green perspex signs that guide visitors through the decades. ""She behaved in exactly the way one wants Zaha Hadid to behave -- we never saw her,"" said co-curator and fashion journalist McDowell with a wry smile. ""We worked with her, and got missives passed backwards and forwards, but it was an Olympian performance,"" he adds, perhaps in reference to the architect's work on both the 2012 London and upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

088e22bf78e39d57c0951cd1d3b7ef9d0b819b57,CNN,"(CNN) -- A major international environmental group has pulled out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, saying the Kimberley Process had refused ""to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny."" So why are so-called ""conflict diamonds"" so controversial? What are conflict diamonds? Conflict or ""blood"" diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa, according to the World Diamond council, which represents the commercial diamond trade. The United Nations defines conflict diamonds as ""...diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council."" They are generally in ""rough"" form, meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut. At the height of the civil war in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world's diamond production. Who suffers? Apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels, thousands of men, women and children in countries such as Sierra Leone are used as slaves to extract diamonds. They are often forced to use primitive, back-breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands. The collected material is then separated using hand-held sieves. What is the Kimberley Process? The Kimberley Process started when Southern African diamond-producing states met in Kimberley, South Africa, in May 2000, to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence. The result was an agreement by the United Nations, European Union, the governments of 74 countries, the World Diamond Council -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as Global Witness. They established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are ""conflict-free."" Each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from, how they were mined, where they were cut and polished, the parties involved, and their ultimate destination. The idea is that members of the Kimberley Process cannot trade with non-members. Is it working? According to Amy Barry of Global Witness, the Kimberley Process has yet to demonstrate itself capable of stopping the trade because of a lack of political will among member states. ""Zimbabwe, for example, is a test case for the KP,"" she told CNN in 2010, alleging that Robert Mugabe's regime has benefited from the sale of blood diamonds despite it being a member of the Kimberley Process. She said the huge Marange diamond fields of eastern Zimbabwe are operated by military-run syndicates who beat or kill miners who don't mine for them or pay bribes. The extreme violence perpetrated by the military even included the mass murder of hundreds of miners by helicopter gunships, she added. But with just one or two member states able to veto any punitive action against abuses or infringements of the KP scheme, no decisive action has been taken against Zimbabwe. ""This consensus decision-making means tough decisions don't get made,"" said Barry. ""Certain countries are putting economic and political interests in front of defending the fundamental principles of the scheme."" Is the ""conflict trade"" limited to diamonds? No. According to Global Witness, rebel fighters and army units have hijacked the trade in mineral ores, used in the production of mobile phones and computers, from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while subjecting the local population to massacres, rape, extortion, and forced labor. The ""conflict minerals"" are then laundered into the global supply chain by export houses, before being transformed into refined metals by large international smelting firms. Global Witness says the operations of some of the world's leading consumer brands are now being scrutinized for evidence of links to this rogue trade.",2,12.383611925094215

Its head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said Wednesday the agency did not release information about deals in the works until they were done. ""Until we reach this point there is no precise information to give because the information doesn't exist,"" he said. Greece's credit rating has been slashed twice in the past two weeks -- most recently being downgraded to ""junk"" -- raising fears for the euro currency used by 16 nations across Europe. Markets worldwide tumbled when Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece earlier this week. It's the first European country to fall below investment grade. What Greece's debt rating downgrade means . The downgrade -- which makes it harder and more expensive for a country to borrow money -- was a major problem for Athens as it struggles to crawl out from beneath the country's massive debt. The national debt of 300 billion euros ($394 billion) is bigger than the country's economy, and some estimates predict it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. Germany is expected to contribute the lion's share of EU funding to bail out Greece. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday her country will do what it can to help Greece out of its financial crisis, ""but also Greece has to do its part."" She was meeting with Strauss-Kahn to hammer out specifics of the deal. ""Obviously what Greece has to do is a difficult thing, but I think they are committed to doing it,"" he said in an appearance with the German leader. Merkel is being pulled in two directions -- toward bailing out Greece in order to stabilize the euro, and away from forking out cash because it is unpopular with German voters, with local elections coming up soon. Former Greek Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said Thursday that German taxpayers have nothing to worry about. ""German taxpayers are going to make money"" when Greece repays the loans, he said on CNN's ""Quest Means Business."" ""Greece will never default,"" he added. He said the country needed the aid package because it no longer had the options it used to have for raising funds. ""The markets have closed, we cannot rely on the markets as we have relied on the markets for so many years,"" he said. Standard & Poor's slashed Spain's debt to a ""AA"" rating Wednesday, down from ""AA+,"" as Merkel and Strauss-Kahn focused on Greece. Who are the credit rating agencies? Spain's economy is among the largest in the European Union, significantly bigger than Greece's. Greek civil servants and private sector workers are planning a 24-hour strike May 5 to protest government austerity measures, the unions announced Wednesday. Sporadic demonstrations have already taken place in several cities, with sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters angry about the coming changes.

A trucker relaxes April 1 on sandbag pallets in Fargo, North Dakota,  which is preparing for more flooding. They hoped to fill 1 million, said Fargo spokeswoman Karena Lunday. ""If we get a million, that will be a total of 4 million we've made since the flood started,"" she said. The first sandbag effort began about March 23. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet at Fargo on March 28, breaking a record that had held since 1897, when the Red River reached 40.1 feet. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning Tuesday, predicting that melting snow -- and possibly rain -- will start to raise river levels on the Red River south of Oslo, Minnesota, this week. Lunday said forecasters expected the river to crest there between April 16-18, possibly reaching 35 feet on April 14. ""I don't think people are as worried as they were the last time, but the possibility of getting up to 40 feet is a concern,"" Lunday told CNN.

dc949bfb80938f4304c7175f0e5a766dd2b0e208,CNN,"(CNN) -- The former manager of the largest U.S. kosher meatpacking plant was arrested Thursday on federal conspiracy charges of harboring illegal immigrants and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft, federal officials said. Agriprocessors, the nation's largest kosher meatpacking plant, is in Postville, Iowa. Sholom Rubashkin, 49, a powerful member of the Hasidic Jewish community and former head of the kosher plant Agriprocessors, was taken into custody Thursday morning by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ""This investigation is not closed and is continuing,"" said Bob Teig, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Rubashkin was arrested in Postville, Iowa, a town of about 2,400 in the northeast corner of the state that is home to the kosher plant. He faces three counts: conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens for profit; aiding and abetting document fraud; and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft. If convicted, the first two counts carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000. The third count carries a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years, Teig said.  See photos around ""ground zero"" of the nation's immigration debate » . ICE spokesman Tim Counts said he could not comment about specifics. ""Things are still unfolding,"" he said. Calls to Agriprocessors seeking reaction have not been returned. Rubashkin made an initial court appearance Thursday afternoon, where he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on the following conditions: He must wear an ankle bracelet that tracks his movement, limit his travel to northern Iowa, surrender his passport and his wife's passport and provide a $1 million appearance bond with $500,000 to be secured by Wednesday, according to the prosecutor's office.

f3a80f5b08da9756ce18cac918bb35cebddf476b,CNN,"(CNN) -- A fourth man has pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime in the death of a black man who was beaten by a gang of young whites, then run over by a pickup truck driven by one of them in Mississippi in 2011. In a separate but related case, another Mississippi man admitted he was part of a group of whites who carried out other racial attacks against African-Americans around the same time. William Kirk Montgomery, 23, from Puckett, Mississippi, pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal hate-crime charges in the death of James Craig Anderson, who was murdered on June 26, 2011, in Jackson, Mississippi, the prosecutor says. Jonathan Gaskamp, 20, admitted to two federal hate crime charges in other attacks carried out on other African-Americans in or around Jackson. James Craig Anderson, 47, died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by Deryl Dedmon, who was part of a group of seven whites, mostly teenagers, from largely white Rankin County who decided to ""go f**k with some n*****s"" after a night of partying and drinking, law enforcement officials have said, quoting some of the suspects in the case. Life sentence in Mississippi hate crime case . Montgomery was one of the ones who left that party in search of a victim. Anderson, a worker at a local auto plant, was outside a Jackson hotel when he was confronted by the group. Anderson's death became national news after CNN obtained and aired videotape capturing the gruesome murder as it happened. The death of the black man, and the shocking videotape showing the murder, prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 537,000 people. On the videotape, two vehicles carrying the group of whites pull into the parking lot and stop where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the whites yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" On the videotape, Anderson first comes into view in the lower right corner of the screen, after he was beaten, according to police. He staggers into the headlights of the green F-250 truck, his white shirt easily visible. The truck backs up, then suddenly surges forward. As the truck nears the defenseless man, its headlights glow brightly on his shirt before he suddenly disappears underneath it. Three of the other whites who were there that night pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes earlier this year. Dedmon, John Aaron Rice and Dylan Butler, all now around age 20, each admitted to conspiracy and violating the 2009 federal hate-crimes law. They face sentences of up to life in prison and $250,000 in fines, federal prosecutors said. Dedmon also pleaded guilty to state murder and hate-crime charges in a state court and was sentenced to life in prison. Murder suspect carried 'backpack of hatred' Gaskamp was at a party with the others when they discussed going out to hunt and hurt blacks on the night Anderson was killed, authorities said, but he was not present when the group came upon Anderson. However, he was present at other attacks at other times, prosecutors now say. CNN had reported previously that the attack on Anderson was only one of a number of racial attacks carried out by the gang of young whites and others who were with them at various times, based on witness accounts and sources close to the investigation. Prosecutors have long told CNN that the additional attacks might bring more arrests or charges. Various groupings of the young men would, at various times, hunt out and target blacks, or others who appeared homeless or drunk, prosecutors said. These people were likely targeted, authorities said, because the group members believed they would be less likely to report attacks to police or to fight back. In these other attacks, according to prosecutors Tuesday, the group of white young men, sometimes along with young women, on numerous occasions drove from Rankin County, which is mostly white, over to Jackson, which is mostly black, specifically with the intent of assaulting blacks. Group members would often boast about what they had done later, prosecutors said. In late 2011 CNN filmed an interview with one former member of the gang who had changed his ways and felt bad about their behavior. That former member told CNN on camera that the group of whites would ""go out hunting"" for blacks to hurt on weekends. But until Gaskamp's plea Tuesday, no details of such attacks had been made public, or had even been substantiated. In one of the other incidents the gang carried out, prosecutors say, Gaskamp and other white teens drove to Jackson to find an African-American to assault, and Gaskamp brought with him a .40-caliber handgun. The group hurled beer bottles at numerous black pedestrians they ran across. Then, after seeing one black man who appeared to be drunk, a group of white teens set upon him, according to prosecutors. In that incident, prosecutors say, Dedmon, Rice and Gaskamp were among the ones who punched and kicked the man repeatedly on his face and all around his body, ""until the man begged for his life."" After the group left the man beaten and wounded on the street, Gaskamp wanted to go back ""so that he could use the gun he had brought with him to shoot the African-American man they just assaulted,"" according to court papers. But the group did not go back that night. ""These teens laughed and boasted about what they had done,"" said Robert Shuler Smith, the district attorney for Jackson and the main prosecutor in the case. And in court, federal prosecutor Sheldon Beer said, ""Members of the group thought it was funny that the man pleaded for his life."" Gaskamp could be sentenced to up to five years in prison for one count and 10 years for the other, Smith said. Montgomery faces up to five years for one count and up to life in prison for the other. Prosecutors tell CNN there may be other arrests or charges. ""This case is not over,"" Smith said. ""This is still ongoing. We would like to pursue justice fully for the Anderson family. We want the Anderson family to be pleased at the end of this case that justice was done.""",1,7.147818182870629
1632b80489b5112c0cef00cbe387b020d0ab8ec6,CNN,"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican announced Thursday in a general decree that it will excommunicate anyone who would attempt to ordain a woman as a priest and the woman herself. The Anglican Church has taken a different approach to ordaining women -- even accepting women as bishops. According to the decree, the excommunications would take place with immediate effect. The decree was signed by Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith. It was not persuasive to Regina Nicolosi, a program coordinator for Roman Catholic Womenpriests, who was ordained two years ago. ""We have come not to take that too seriously,"" said Nicolosi, a 66-year-old married mother and grandmother who lives in Red Wing, Minnesota, and said her group is composed of 40 to 50 women priests, none of whom are recognized by the church hierarchy.

She predicted that the church's resistance will backfire.

df2a1d0d353eb996e65f91197059dfd561fbe771,CNN,"(CNN) -- It's often assumed that older people generally aren't very digitally savvy -- but new research from Pew indicates that older people are becoming about as skilled online as younger ones. According to the 2010 Generations report from the Pew Internet and American Life project, ""The biggest online trend (we found) is that, while the very youngest and oldest cohorts may differ, certain key internet uses are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups."" The study found that internet users aged 34 and older are more likely than those age 33 and younger to engage in several online activities, including visiting government sites and getting financial information online. These online activities are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups: e-mail, search engines, getting health information, following the news, researching or making purchases (including travel reservations), online banking, supplying reviews or ratings, donating to charity, and downloading podcasts. And get ready: Your grandmother might soon try to friend you on Facebook. Even though younger people are significantly more likely to use social networking services, Pew reports that ""the fastest growth has come from internet users 74 and older: social network site usage for this oldest cohort has quadrupled since 2008, from 4% to 16%."" Some online trends are creeping down the age ladder, too. According to Pew, it used to be mostly older adults who searched for online health information. But now this has become ""the third most popular online activity for all internet users 18 and older."" Wireless net access is definitely not the exclusive province of youth. Like the recent iPass mobile workforce study -- which put the median aged of a mobile-enabled worker at 46 -- Pew found that 55% of people aged 46-55 access websites or other digital media or services via a laptop, cell phone, or other internet-connected mobile device. That figure drops to 46% for people aged 56-64, and 33% for people aged 65-73. The bottom line is, don't assume you know how digitally savvy someone is based on their age.

06e0845a168e9612b31a908d3141dcda03849c9b,CNN,"(CNN) -- ItÂ´s the ultimate repair tool. A silicone material that can be shaped like playdough, can bond to almost any surface and after a few hours of exposure to air becomes a super tough, durable rubber. ""Sugru"" - coming from the Irish word for ""play"" - is now being used to fix leaky pipes, create custom-made handles and even help a disabled, fingerless canoeist modify one of her paddles. Unlike existing moldable putty, Sugru doesn't go rock hard when dry, but stays flexible, waterproof and heat resistant up to 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit). ""We think that Sugru can be something as big or bigger than duct tape, superglue or anything else that you use to repair,"" says its Irish-born inventor Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh. However, like many great inventions before, it only came into existence by chance. Ni Dhulchaointigh, a design student at the Royal College of Art in London at the time, had been messing around in the workshop, trying out new combinations of materials when she started mixing silicone adhesive and wood-waste into small balls. They looked like wood when finished, but when you threw them on the floor they would bounce. ""I thought, that's random,"" says Ni Dhulchaointigh, who admits many other designers might have then left it at that. ""But for me, I knew that there was something there. There was something a little bit magical. I just didn't know what it was."" It was only as she began using bits of the material around her home to repair things that she had what she calls her ""eureka moment"" and came to realize its real usefulness and application. ""Every time I'd make up a batch of it for my experiments, I'd have bits left over. I hate wasting stuff so I started using the leftovers around my house just to fix little things, I modified a kitchen knife that was really uncomfortable. My sink plug was just slightly too small, so I just made a little ring to make that work. ""I was doing it completely unconsciously. And I was there beating myself up going, I can't find the application for this material, until my boyfriend James said to me one night, maybe there's not this one perfect thing for this material. Maybe what you're doing in the kitchen is actually the thing."" It took six years of hard work before the first packs of her material were being sold to consumers. Her story from the workshop to marketplace, together with the help of business partners and friends, has been a familiar one of luck, near bankruptcy and late salvation. ""It has been a long journey,"" she says. ""First of all, the technology has been difficult to invent. But second of all, you know, we're not a big company with big budgets behind us."" Send your photos of Sugru fixes to CNN's iReport . ""We've been doing it on a shoestring for years. And anyone who's ever pitched for investment funding will know it's a bitch. It's really difficult for an unlikely group of people to get investment funding. I mean, we probably pitched to over 100 investors where we got, maybe two or three over the years."" Around 2008, five years after she first came up with the idea, with a product almost ready to launch, Jane and her small team of partners found themselves close to running out of money, as promised investment from major manufacturers failed to materialize. Watch: See how versatile and strong Sugru is . In a last ditch attempt, they decided to scrape together enough money to build their own ""little cottage industry factory"" and do it themselves. And with the help of family and friends they put together 1,000 packs. ""What we're quite good at is design, it's what we do, so we had a fantastic package design and a really great website design. When we went live it looked like we were much bigger than we were."" From that point, the investors came on board fast and in less than three years they have ballooned to annual sales of $2 million, a staff of 25 and a customer base of more than 100,000 across 100 countries. Perhaps, the most unique thing about Sugru is that its practical uses is being demonstrated not by its inventor, but by the general public. Thousands of people have posted comments and pictures on Twitter, YouTube and other websites showing how they have put the material to good use. ""We get emails every day with pictures and stories of what people have done. They do things with it that we couldn't have dreamed of. It feels like magic sometimes."" Ni Dhulchaointigh says her product is the ultimate tool in the battle against wastefulness. ""I think it can really benefit our urban way of life, where we depend so much on buying new things all the time and replacing them if they're not quite right. It's not only wasteful, but it doesn't make the most of us as human beings with all the potential that we have.""",7,11.515841721500601

2e94fd340d2e9f71b606cb44e8819f7d88c4de3f,CNN,"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Angry protests are a common sight in Pakistan. Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet. AntiTaliban protesters in Lahore. But in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban. ""I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I'm not scared,"" vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin. She was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting ""the Taliban is the enemy of Islam"" in Urdu. Public protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban's recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are ""unIslamic"" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis. Neha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban. ""I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I'm living,"" the 23-year-old student said. ""These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam."" ""There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us,"" Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing » . More than 250 miles away, Pakistan's military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country's northwestern tribal regions. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country's constitution. Mehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban's version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture. ""Our way of life is being threatened,"" said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. ""And if we don't do anything about it, then you're just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country's all about is going to stand for nothing."" Rokni said he fears the Taliban ""want to change the way we exist."" Lahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks. ""Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone,"" Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said. As he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city's police headquarters. In March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team's driver. Weeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan's Taliban. Police in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan's second largest city. ""They're here in Lahore, this is the thing,"" said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, ""Lal"" which means ""Red."" ""Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don't they'll shoot them."" Rahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for ""Lal"" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban. ""We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy,"" he said. It is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan's wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country. Either way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban's threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led ""war on terror."" Mehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists. ""If the Taliban take over then I'll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don't want that,"" she said. Some Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf. More than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city's Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement. The government in Karachi has issued a ""shoot on sight"" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city.

6089ebf3e72a3087121245d9308ff87335e30741,CNN,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan officials sounded an alarm Saturday over NATO bombings of three ports that they said would trigger a crisis by limiting the movement of supply ships carrying critical supplies in and out of the war-torn nation. NATO jets destroyed eight Libyan warships in the ports of Tripoli, Al-Khums and Sirte after concluding that Col. Moammar Gadhafi had started using naval assets to lay mines and hamper international humanitarian aid, said Mike Bracken, NATO's military spokesman. Libyan officials said, however, that the airstrikes violated the United Nations resolution mandating the protection of civilians. Amran al-Forjani, Libya's chief coastguard commandant, called the operation a ""crazy attack."" No deaths or injuries were reported. Bracken said at a Friday news conference that the NATO strikes were justified. Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid, Bracken said. ""He was using maritime forces to lay mines. These were legal targets,"" he said. NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi's nearly 42 years of rule. NATO and human rights groups said Libyan forces have targeted aid ships coming in and out of Misrata, where a bloody see-saw battle has raged between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels. But the coast guard commandant denied that his vessels were used to attack Misrata or any other Libyan city. A Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area Friday said the commercial port, not the nearby military port, was hit. From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area, it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit. Six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel in dock for maintenance, said Mohammed Ahmed Rashed, the port general manager. The port remained operational, according to officials, but the strikes would impact the limited movement of supply ships. Libyan officials said the port is the main food and fuel supply line, and they expect the strikes to deter freight ships from coming because of security concerns and to increase the insurance on ships and goods. In another development, the European Union will open an office in Benghazi on Sunday, officials said. Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, will open the office, said the National Transitional Council, which is based in the city. The council, in a statement, quoted Ashton as saying,  ""It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya. I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council, civil society groups and our international partners, and will report back to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday. Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people. It is the EU putting words into action."" Also Saturday, Libyan rebels released four French nationals detained in Benghazi since May 11. The four traveled to Egypt on Saturday, where they were taken in by French consular authorities, the  French Foreign Ministry said. And in western Libya, a government bus carrying three foreigners working for international media organizations -- Phoenix TV, BBC and Reuters -- was attacked by an angry mob in Zawiya. The journalists were on their way to the Tunisian border. They escaped unharmed. Yijun Zhou, a reporter for Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV, said an angry crowd of dozens surrounded the bus and a man with a knife slashed the tires of the bus, kicked in the doors and climbed aboard followed by five more men. Reuters producer Guy Desmond, who was also on the bus, said at least two of the attackers had pistols and one had a knife. They shouted at the journalists, demanding to know their nationalities and employers.The journalists were taken to a police station for two hours before they returned to Tripoli to get another bus back to the border. Meanwhile, pro-Gadhafi forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya, one of the Libyan leader's former generals said. As of Friday night, one rebel was dead and three were wounded, one of them critically, the former commander said. He now commands rebels in Zintan, using the name Hajj Usama. The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan, about 90 miles southwest of the capital, Tripoli. In response, Usama said he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi's advance. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.",7,9.697097921534803

Morgan Lawless, who has cerebral palsy, plays baseball at Bay Creek Park near Atlanta, Georgia. The 14-year-old middle-school student clenched her teeth as she swung the bat into a single. Instead of running to first base, Lawless zoomed over in her motorized wheelchair. Lawless has cerebral palsy. She's among nearly 300 children who play in a special-needs baseball league at Bay Creek Park in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Loganville. ""It's actually fun because we get to be kids and we can play like regular people,"" Lawless said. What's different about this ballpark is that the field is made of a rubberized material that allows for easier movement in wheelchairs. ""We started out on a dirt field,"" said league founder Cathy Smith. ""But power wheelchairs and dirt don't mix."" Smith helped raise some of the half-million dollars in private and county funding needed to build the field in 2004. She said she gets goosebumps whenever she watches the young players come across home plate. ""The grin and smile on their faces just says it all."" Coach Tom Estes joined the program eight years ago with his now-15-year-old son, Justin, who has cerebral palsy. Estes noted that some of the players, like his son, use a wheelchair, but others with autism, Down syndrome and multiple sclerosis are ambulatory.  Health Minute: Watch more on special needs baseball » . During a game, the children are paired with young helpers from another local baseball league. No special skills are required to participate, Estes said. ""If we have to help them hit, help them run, help them catch, we are simply here to let them play baseball."" The coaches have taken extra precautions to make sure no one gets hurt. The players wear batting helmets, and a coach feeds large, softball-sized rubber balls into a pitching machine to control the direction. There are no umpires, and no one really keeps score. ""We have a lot of tie ball games,"" Estes chuckled. The games are short, just two innings, but everyone gets to play. ""It's not about competition as much as it is about the ability to just do what other kids do,"" said Mike Lawless, Morgan's father. He said his daughter looks forward to the games all week. So does Estes' son. ""Until you get involved, you don't realize the closed life they live,"" Tom Estes said. Being part of the team gives the players a sense of independence and self control and gets them outside in the fresh air, he said. ""They're out here doing the same thing as the other kids. They really don't do that on a normal basis."" The weekly games also give the kids something to brag about in school on Monday morning, Estes said. ""They hear everyone else talking about it...and my son can say, 'Yeah, I hit a home run yesterday, too. It was great.' "" Justin Estes seemed to take all the attention in stride. And what does he think is the best part about playing baseball? Pointing past his wheelchair to the smooth surface of the field, he said simply, ""No ruts.""",3,11.023121776635179
5501c7d032d82fcd9d53cb0636caac692af04b41,CNN,"(CNN) -- Around the world, and in developing nations especially, there is an overwhelming demand for higher education. Despite worldwide increases in tertiary enrolment numbers, there still remains disparity between those with access to quality education and those without. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, only 6% of college-age students are enrolled in higher education. John Defterios: The world's next economic powers don't need the West . That number rises to 72% in North America and Western Europe, but hovers around 20% to 40% for most developing regions, according to UNESCO reports. Without higher education, most people face a grim future. But once you consider the possibilities provided by an internet connection and the growing availability of quality online education resources, the conversation about accessibility shifts from ""where"" to ""how,"" and exciting new opportunities (and challenges) arise. So how do we actualize the idea of education for everyone? Read more: Does Brazil deserve its 'B' for BRIC? At Coursera, only one-third of our students are from the U.S., and 40% are from the developing world. Not surprisingly, three of our biggest countries outside the U.S. are Brazil, India, and Russia, where the number of jobs that require a higher education greatly exceeds the number of people with education sufficient to do these jobs. In Russia, for example, new student enrollments rose 230% since January 2013 (surpassing new student growth from the U.S., which is up 178%). Our large international growth poses challenges in dealing with cultural and language differences. The challenges . Despite our global reach, most of the course material and lectures found on our platform are in English, making the courses inaccessible to many students whose native language is not English. To address this issue, we are taking a two pronged approach. First, we are working with our partner universities in non-English-speaking countries to offer courses taught natively in languages other than English (currently French, Spanish, Chinese, German, and Italian). More from Koller: Top college courses, for free? We are also building up a network of ""translation partners"" - non-profits, companies, and universities - to translate Coursera lectures from popular courses into a selection of languages common among our students. Reducing language barriers opens up new possibilities and applications of online education. Experiments in global learning . Moscow-based Digital October (one of our translation partners) has experimented with creative ways to use online education to transcend cultural and language barriers. The center for new technology and entrepreneurship recently hosted a multi-national ""ideahack."" This interactive meet-up centered around the University of Pennsylvania's online Gamification course, and attracted more than 200 live students from Moscow and 15 students from three continents around the world via video conference, with the event being simultaneously translated for Russian and English audiences. Fareed Zakaria: How to beat inequality . Those attending worked in small groups applying principles learnt from Professor Kevin Werbach's Coursera course. Professor Werbach participated virtually throughout the event. Princeton's Professor Mitch Duneier taught his sociology class to a global audience. He says that: ""Within three weeks I had received more feedback on my sociological ideas than I had in a career of teaching, which significantly influenced each of my subsequent lectures and seminars."" These insights have reshaped the way he teaches his Princeton students on campus. One student wrote to him, saying, ""It has been an incredible experience for me, one that has not only taught me sociology, but the ways in which other cultures think, feel, and respond."" Bill Gates: I just don't see room for education cuts . By their very nature, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) foster an open environment where people from all walks of life can contribute to a thriving collaborative community. Translation of online courses further helps increase access to people from diverse backgrounds, and thereby enables the true globalization of education. Other models for online education are also being explored, such as the flipped classroom, which makes high-quality course content available in conjunction with local instruction. This can provide much needed expansion of education in the many countries that lack qualified instructors. The future . With the rise of online education, the notion of a ""global classroom"" is being discussed by educators and the media alike. To me, achieving a ""global classroom"" means using education to erase barriers between people of different cultures and backgrounds; it means giving people the opportunity to learn without the limits imposed by physical or socio-economic circumstances; and it means giving schools and instructors around the world the ability to transcend boundaries to bring high-quality education to their students.

7cca08e338a367162023e9a12bfa26ccd140b7a1,CNN,"(CNN) -- It is one of the most passionate derbies in world football. Not only do Internazionale and AC Milan share a city, they also share a stadium -- the San Siro -- but as they prepare to meet for the first time this season the notoriously febrile atmosphere this enduring fixture generates might be significantly muted. The Italian authorities have ordered the closure of the Curva Nord section of the stadium, where Inter's most vociferous fan congregate, in response to chanting aimed at Napoli supporters in their game last weekend. Now, in what is Inter's ""home"" game, the Nerazzurri risk being outnumbered by the fans of their bitter rival club. It is the latest in a string of turf war incidents that come under the banner of territorial discrimination, where regional disputes between sets of fans are played out in chants during top-flight matches. While the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) used to hand out hefty fines to deal with such incidents, clubs agreed prior to the start of the season to use the threat of stadium closures in order to tackle the problem head on. Juventus' stadium was partially closed for two Serie A matches earlier this season after their fans sang derogatory chants during a victory over Napoli, prompting an appeal from the club's general manager Beppe Marotta for their supporters to stop bellowing ""self-harming"" songs. Italian football is now locked in a duel fight, to try and combat incidents of racist chanting towards black players that have blighted the game both this season and last, and these long-running spats between different parts of Italy's cities as well as its regions. Italians frequently define themselves by their region and that regionalism is often played out in the nation's football stadiums. And in an interview with CNN World Sport in October, Juve's president Andrea Agnelli said it was vitally important to make a distinction between racism an these regional turf wars. ""Italy is the land of the 1,000 boroughs,"" Agnelli exclusively told CNN. ""There is rivalry between two boroughs that are 50 meters away and they don't talk to each other. ""A lot of what goes under racism in terms of international news is actually territorial discrimination. Is that acceptable? No, but it is completely different to racism. ""It is the same song that has been sung for 25 or 30 years and suddenly what happened in August, the board of the (Italian) federation changed the (punishment) from administrative fines to penalties that led to the closure of a part of the stadium or the stadium itself."" Agnelli argued it was ""nonsense"" that the new edicts had effectively handed too much power to hardcore groups of fans who are usually the protagonists when offensive songs are aired. ""As it stands, it is unreasonable and it obviously gives too much control to the group of hardcore fans; now they have a tool to decide what is going to happen. ""Again, there is that subtle but definitive distinction between racism and typical Italian territorial confrontation. ""It is going to be difficult to (change anything) in the middle of the season because some punishments have already been done."" A group of Inter's fans have also called the closure of the Curva Nord ""nonsensical"" while some say they plan on boycotting the match in response to the league's decision. Stadium closures have become a frequent occurrence over the past few seasons in Italian football, but mostly in response to incidents of a racist nature. The most high profile came in a friendly match between AC Milan and lower league team Pro Patria in January 2013, when AC midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng left the field after being the subject of monkey noises from a section of the home support. Specter of racism . His protest made headlines around the globe and prompted soccer's authorities to confront the ugly specter of racism in football. The game's world governing body FIFA subsequently set up a racism task force that suggested harsher punishments for players or clubs found guilty of discrimination. But still the abuse continued. In May 2013, Boateng -- who now plays for Schalke in Germany -- and teammates Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari were the targets when Milan's clash with Roma was temporarily halted as visiting fans chanted racist abuse at the trio. Agnelli acknowledged there is a problem in Italian football regarding racism and welcomed the tougher stance from the game's ruling bodies but warned it would still take some time before players from different cultures were fully embraced. ""Any form of racism should be fought,"" he said. ""In Italy there is a high degree of attitudes that aren't ready for embracing different cultures and religions. ""I came to high school in England in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and there are things that were said then that were considered normal that would be considered unreasonable now. ""The UK has started much earlier than us in terms of embracing different cultures and regions. ""The UK has always had a much higher percentage of black people in the country so it was much more normal for you. ""We are in the United Kingdom of the 1970s (in Italy) so you have to place things into context. ""If you judge it from a British point of view, what has happened is unacceptable, but you have to understand that you need to take some steps before certain aspects are digested and made familiar and embraced by a population, a culture and a country."" Agnelli says it is hypocritical for clubs to be complaining about the punishments when they voted them through prior to the start of the season. ""Up until last year the same chants were sung and it was an administrative fine, â‚¬20,000 or â‚¬30,000 and nobody cared,"" he said. ""Suddenly, because of these penalties, it came to the news. ""Italy is very peculiar on that front, so you should distinguish between territorial discrimination -- which we are not in favor of -- but it is very different from racism, they are not on the same level. ""The same people who (have been) moaning about it are the same people that in August voted that they were fine with the fines that would be given. ""So there has to be a step up in terms of attention into everything that happens in the governance of football because that was obvious and evident it was coming.""",7,6.623514129650285
af2a3c29d1f8f821d40f7b923300ced041bf4000,CNN,"(CNN) -- French gangster Redoine Faid, the subject of an international manhunt after his brazen escape from a prison last month, is back in custody, the country's Interior Ministry said Wednesday. Faid held five people, including four guards, at gunpoint at a detention center in the northern city of Lille on April 13, officials said. He then burst his way to freedom, detonating explosives to destroy five doors. Early Wednesday, French police arrested Faid, labeled France's ""public enemy No. 1,"" at a hotel in the Seine-et-Marne region to the east of Paris, the ministry said. Between 70 and 80 police officers took part in the predawn raid, Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre told reporters. Faid was asleep and offered no resistance when police entered his hotel room. An accomplice was with him in the room and has been taken into custody, Fevre said. Police found one firearm in the room and another in a car parked nearby. During his six weeks on the run, Faid had worn a wig and let his beard grow in order not to be recognized, Fevre said. He'd changed location frequently but has connections in the area where he was caught, the prosecutor said. ""When you are on the run, you need a lot of money and you need to separate yourself from all your close relatives,"" said Fevre. He suggested Faid had failed to meet one or both of these requirements. As well as the jailbreak, Faid is suspected in the murder of a policewoman in 2010 and faces a possible life sentence, Fevre said. However, he won't go back to the Sequedin prison from which he made his audacious escape, Fevre said. The four guards Redoine took hostage in April are still on medical leave, he added. Inspired by the movies . Faid fashioned himself as a modern-day gangster. He thought big -- getting inspiration from the movies, as when he wore a hockey mask like Robert DeNiro's character in ""Heat"" -- and acted boldly, attacking armored trucks among other targets. In his 2010 autobiography, ""Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime,"" Faid chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of France's most notorious criminals. In 1998, after three years on the run during which he fled to Switzerland, Faid was finally caught. Sentenced to 20 years, he ended up spending more than 10 years in high-security prisons around France. After getting out, Faid put himself out there -- not only with his book, but as the subject of numerous interviews. The Frenchman insisted he'd sworn off his wicked ways. This promise didn't last for long. In 2011, Faid landed back behind bars. There he stayed until his dramatic escape last month. Authorities issued a European arrest warrant covering 26 countries, and Interpol worked to track him down as well. On Wednesday, that hunt came to an end.

Authorities have not officially identified the victims. The Arlington Police Department said it will need to consult with the medical examiner's office before doing so. However, church members who gathered outside NorthPointe Baptist Church after the discovery Thursday afternoon said the 29-year-old pastor of the church had been killed and his 67-year-old ministry assistant wounded, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. A family member of one of the victims contacted police after not being able to reach their loved one. A friend who went by the church saw a person lying on the the floor motionless through a church window, police said. Police arrived a short time later and discovered the two victims inside. Police said a car belonging to the ministry assistant is missing and may have been taken by a suspect or suspects in the case.

5dad6d2730b4668a8b4d8dec4fa73234bbad446b,CNN,"Buchanan, New York (CNN) -- Stepping into the containment dome of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 is almost surreal. It's like entering a movie set, but instead of walking by wooden props, we're passing through an 11-foot-thick concrete-and-steel wall. This is the nuclear facility that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to shut down, the long-time target of both anti-nuclear and environmental activists, the nuclear power plant that sits only some 25 miles from New York City. Just a strip of yellow tape warning of radioactive danger separates me, my producer Sheila Steffen and cameramen Rod Griola and Ken Borland from white-uniformed technicians who are removing groups of nuclear fuel rods (204 rods are packaged together in each fuel assembly) and inserting new ones, a month-long process that takes place every two years. Armed guards stand behind us, even after we have cleared three levels of tight security and a radiation briefing. Getting into the White House is easier, far easier. Around my neck are two Indian Point security passes and two dosimeters that will measure the amount of radiation I receive: one will be sent for analysis to a laboratory, the other is an electronic-arming dosimeter, a real-time radiation detector set to beep if I were to receive a dose of 100 millirems per hour. (During our radiation briefing we are told a chest x-ray delivers 8 millirems.) A massive 100-ton steel plug hangs from cables. Below, workers surround the nuclear core, which is underwater. They control machinery that delicately moves the fuel assemblies through a water-filled canal connected to the spent fuel pool, where rods filled with uranium pellets cool down for years. There are nearly 50,000 uranium pellets in each fuel assembly collection of rods. Pumps keep water circulating into the pool so it remains at a temperature of 100-degrees Fahrenheit (compared to the 2,100 degrees that nuclear fuel can reach before it would meltdown). So, keeping the power on here is essential to averting disaster. Indian Point receives its power from the same electric grid to which it contributes. If the power goes out -- and it briefly did only three weeks ago due to a utility technician's error -- backup diesel generators kick in to keep the plant functioning. That's exactly what happened during the recent outage. Each of Indian Point's two reactors have three auxiliary diesel generators, and then there are separately located backups to those backups as well as diesel-driven fire pumps that can keep the spent fuel rod pools filled. It's all designed to avoid the kind of catastrophe that occurred at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plant managers spend lots of time thinking about potential emergencies and how to avert them. ""Our plant is designed to handle the worst natural disaster. Our people are trained. We have many layers of redundancy,"" said John Dinelli, director of operations at Indian Point. The plant is built to withstand at least a 6.0-magnitude earthquake, greater than the region has ever experienced, though researchers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory warn a 7.0 is not out of the realm of possibility since they have determined the plants is built near the intersection of two active seismic zones. ""We believe that we can handle a (magnitude) 7 earthquake,"" said Joseph Pollock, vice president of operations for Entergy, the plant's owner. ""The theoretically highest predicted earthquake in this area would be of a magnitude where our plant design will be able to withstand that and we would be able to respond and shut the plant down in a safe manner."" In truth, Indian Point's operators say, a severe hurricane is a far more likely event, for which they also have extensive contingency plans. During the month-long refueling process at unit No. 3, the containment dome's hatch remains open. To be prepared for a natural hazard -- or even the possibility of an attack -- Indian Point keeps a giant plug sitting on a massive forklift nearby that plant workers can shove into place within 15 minutes to protect the reactor. Such precautions and procedures are part of Entergy's application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year operating license renewal. Unit No. 3's license expires in 2015, unit No. 2 in 2013. (Indian Point shut down its original reactor, No. 1, in 1974). Back inside the dome, after technicians vertically lift a 12-foot fuel assembly from the nuclear core, they turn it horizontally and move it along a water-filled canal to the adjacent building that houses the spent fuel pool where the assembly is positioned in an upright rack for cooling, which takes years. The pool about 40 feet deep, surrounded by 6 feet of concrete on all sides, and it has a greenish tint to it. Workers stand on metal ramps overhead, prepared to accept the next spent fuel assembly. My electronic arming dosimeter registers a .3 millirem, its first detection of radiation. In a locked, plexiglass-enclosed case not far from the pool sit brand new fuel assemblies fresh from Westinghouse, waiting their turn for a swim to the nuclear reactor core. As precise as the underwater operations are, they are not without flaw. In unit No. 2, Indian Point's other active plant, there has been a relatively small leak during refueling that officials say has let out as much as eight gallons of contaminated water a day into the containment dome area. ""We haven't found the exact location of the leak to be able to do the repair and stop it,"" said Pollock. ""We're working with a couple of firms. Right now there's a technique being used in Germany that we're trying to see if it would work here and we're going through that evaluation right now."" Pollock says the leak is neither cause for concern nor a safety hazard since it's within one of the reactor domes. As we leave the spent fuel pool, we hand in both our dosimeters for analysis before stepping into a device that detects if we've picked up any contaminants on our clothing or shoes. I step in, push my chest against the oversized metal detector style contraption, wait an uncomfortably long 30-seconds, then do the same with my back up against the device. My heartbeat slows as I step through the locked security gate and walk back towards the largest part of the nuclear plant: the power-generating room. This is where the steam that's created from the nuclear reactor flows through huge tubes to turn giant turbines that power the generator that produces the electricity Indian Point sends off to the grid. Each plant generates 1,000 megawatts of power, providing as much as 30% of the electricity for New York and Westchester County. Since unit No. 3 is undergoing refueling, workers are busy maintaining and upgrading the turbines and generator. Both Indian Point plants are pressurized water reactors, as opposed to the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, which is a boiling water reactor. Pressurized reactors aren't necessarily safer than boiling water reactors, they just employ a different technique to harness the heat generated by nuclear fission to produce steam. As the nuclear crisis unfolds in Japan, Indian Point officials say they're hoping for details that might help operations here. ""Undoubtedly we will come back with lessons learned to continue to improve our safety margins and increase them even further,"" said Pollack. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is initiating a safety review of Indian Point and all other U.S. nuclear power facilities, as part of its response to the crisis in Japan.",2,9.915736803391788
2f72b6e52be5b500a41dbe05d64504c905ff9596,CNN,"(CNN) -- The U.S. government allegedly spied on prominent American Muslims under the same program it used to keep tabs on suspected terrorists, according to documents held by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. Journalists Glenn Greenwald and Murtaza Hussain, writing for The Intercept, said Snowden provided them documents that show that at least five American Muslims were monitored by their own government for periods between 2002 and 2008. The names of Republican Party operative and lawyer Faisal Gill; attorney Asim Ghafoor; international relations professor Hooshang Amirahmadi; Muslim civil liberties advocate Agha Saeed; and the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Affairs, Nihad Awad, all appear on a spreadsheet that purportedly lists individuals under NSA, CIA or FBI digital surveillance. The spreadsheet shows more than 7,000 e-mail addresses that appear to include the names of foreigners linked to terrorist organizations and U.S. citizens suspected of terrorist activity, according to The Intercept's report. But also on the list are the names of the five prominent Muslim-Americans, who have never been accused or charged with terrorism, and who deny any involvement in terrorism. Accusations of profiling . Two of them -- Gill and Ghafoor -- told CNN that they were targeted just because they are Muslim, a violation of their rights. ""I can't think of any other reason,"" Gill said. ""Absolutely. No other reason,"" Ghafoor said. Gill said he had a security clearance working in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""That's why my No. 1 reaction was of shock and surprise because there's nothing in my background that would lead any law enforcement agency to suspect me of any acts of terror,"" Gill said. Ghafoor is a civil rights attorney who represented clients in terrorism-related cases. ""If it's my clients that's causing it,"" Ghafoor said of the alleged spying on him, ""that's a reason for pause -- to find out what benefit does the government have listening in on the lawyer's communications with his or her client? What information can they use in court? ""Imagine a government lawyer telling his or her supervisors we had to listen to his calls and maybe we can go to court to beat him,"" Ghafoor said. Ghafoor said that the government apparently spied on his Yahoo e-mail -- not his e-mail with his law firm. ""I feel sorry for the agents who had to read all of that. There's not a whole lot you will get from my Yahoo account,"" Ghafoor said. Opinion: A year after Snowden, the real costs of NSA surveillance . Gill served in the Navy and later became a senior policy adviser in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. Gill also worked as a spokesman for American Muslim Council, whose founder and executive director, Aldurahman M. Alamoudi, was sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2004 for activities with nations and groups with ties to terrorism. But the U.S. government allegedly spied on Gill from 2006 to 2008 -- after Gill left the council and when Gill was the Republican nominee for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, journalist Greenwald told CNN. Gill said he did not know Alamoudi and hardly had contact with him. Moreover, after he left the Muslim council, Gill disclosed that job to the U.S. government, which eventually gave him a security clearance. ""Surveillance needs to happen but there has to be a reason for it,"" Gill said. ""There was nothing in my background."" He asserted that authorities have a 99.6% success rate in obtaining warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, or FISA, Court, which rules on U.S. requests to do surveillance on suspected terrorists and spies. Gill described that success rate ""ridiculous."" ""If you go to any county in the United States...it would not be that high. Clearly there is something wrong,"" Gill said. Gill told The Intercept that he believes that his e-mails were intercepted because he is Muslim. ""Look, I've never made an appearance or been a lawyer for anyone who's been (associated with terrorism),"" he told The Intercept. ""But there are plenty of other lawyers who have made those appearances and actually represented those governments, and their name isn't Faisal Gill and they weren't born in Pakistan and they aren't on this list."" U.S. response . In a joint statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department denied that the U.S. government conducts surveillance based on anyone's politics, religion or activism. ""Unlike some other nations, the United States does not monitor anyone's communications in order to suppress criticism or to put people at a disadvantage based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation or religion,"" the statement said. Any surveillance of U.S. citizens requires a court order from the FISA Court, the statement says. ""These court orders are issued by an independent federal judge only if probable cause, based on specific facts, are established that the person is an agent of a foreign power, a terrorist, a spy, or someone who takes orders from a foreign power,"" the statement says. But The Intercept reported that at least one of the five American Muslims was spied on without a FISA warrant. In addition, one of the documents provided to The Intercept by Snowden instructs agents on the proper way to compose a memo to request FISA surveillance. In the example, it lists a fake name -- ""Mohammed Raghead"" -- as a placeholder. An NSA spokeswoman quoted in the report said that the agency would not allow such insulting language to be used in its training documents. CAIR, the nation's largest Muslim civil liberties group and led by Awad, called for a full accounting of government spying on American Muslims. ""This is an outrageous continuation of civil rights era surveillance of minority community leadership by government elements who see threats in all patriotic dissent,"" the group said in a statement.

When he left her home in Ohio to go work in West Virginia's Upper Big Branch South Mine, Napper left behind letters for his girlfriend and small daughter. According to his mother, Pam Napper, the letters told them, ""If anything happens to me, I'll be looking down from heaven at you all."" He told his girlfriend he loved her and asked that ""my baby girl"" be taken care of, Pam Napper said. ""He grabbed my hand and he said, 'Mom, I love you,' "" she said. ""I said, 'I love you too, Josh, I'll always love you.' "" Were you and your family affected by the blast? Share your story .

""I was just sitting on the couch that morning, Monday, and I just felt in my heart and my stomach that something was definitely wrong,"" she said. Joshua Napper had been working in the mine for eight weeks. When he asked his mother if he could, she initially said no but gave in after he begged her. ""He said, 'Please, mom,' "" she said. ""I said, 'OK, you're 25. I have to let you go. I have to let you make your own decisions in life.' "" She said her son called her one day last week at 3:30 p.m., long before he should have gotten off work. ""Bad ventilation in the mines,"" he told her. ""They sent us home early."" ""They sent the whole crew home,"" Pam Napper told CNN's Roberts. ""It scared me, because I've been raised all my life with coal mines. But you know, we've never heard of explosions and things like this, that's going on in the mines now."" In the aftermath of Monday's blast, some have pointed to numerous citations -- including some for ventilation issues -- issued to Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine. Asked if she had any questions for Massey, however, she said no. ""I just know there were things there that weren't right,"" she said, but added her brother would never have endangered her son or his son if he believed the work was unsafe. ""I think it was just a freak accident,"" she said. ""I think something just happened. I don't really know."" She is grappling with losing three members of her family. ""I've been in a coal miner family,"" she said. ""This is not the only one we've lost. We've lost younger ones, too."" Such losses are part of life in a West Virginia mining family, she said. ""It's their living; that's how they make a living,"" she said. ""That's just West Virginia, and when something bad happens, we come together.""",2,8.705041329525605
14804f15246ff3c352af785a8c800375e44d829b,CNN,"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday. Searchers have discovered hundreds of pieces of wreckage from Air France Flight 447. ""The debris ... will be sent to Toulouse where they will be examined at the Center of Aeronautics Tests of Toulouse (a branch of the Defense Ministry) under the control of the police and the BEA investigators,"" said the French air accident investigation agency BEA. The wreckage was transported to France from Brazil by the ship ""La Ville de Bordeaux,"" according to the plane's manufacturer Airbus. It will be taken overland to Toulouse by truck. Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather as if flew from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France on June 1. Only 51 bodies were recovered, and the search is ongoing for the cause of the crash. The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- commonly known as ""black boxes"" -- stop giving out acoustic broadcasts after 30 days. But investigators decided to continue listening for the ""pings"" for another 10 days after that. On July 10, two U.S. naval vessels and the French Navy submarine called off their search for the recorders, which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how and why the plane crashed. The second phase of the search will involve France's oceanographic ship ""Pourquoi Pas?"" which carries specialized exploration and intervention vehicles, according to the BEA. The French vessel will conduct new searches using diving equipment and towed sonar, the BEA said. Finding the recorders is of ""capital importance"" and ""no effort must be spared in achieving this end,"" Air France has said. ""We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful,"" an Air France representative told CNN. The crash was the worst in Air France's 75-year history. Earlier this month, investigators revealed that the plane bellyflopped intact into the Atlantic Ocean. Investigator Alain Bouillard said it was still not clear what caused the crash. The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said in the past, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult. ""It is as if it fell in the Andes (mountains),"" Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said. Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military. Investigators have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, Bouillard said.",2,9.825908068585976
aa701dcdd85a129aeb9ea8b239f6cbfa44a37f9e,CNN,"(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales is apologizing to the Jewish community in neighboring Argentina for having hosted the Iranian defense minister last month. Morales ""recognized he made a mistake,"" according to a statement posted Saturday on the website of the Argentine umbrella organization for the Jewish community, DAIA. The published apology came a day after Jewish leaders met with the president to discuss the case and other matters. The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is wanted in Argentina for his alleged role in planning the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people. Bolivia's defense ministry had invited Vahidi to attend the inauguration of a military academy as a guest. Bolivia's president was also at the event. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" for Vahidi, which seeks other governments' help in detaining him for possible extradition, and the DAIA demanded that Bolivia arrest him when they learned of his visit. Instead, Bolivian authorities asked Vahidi to leave the South American country immediately, which he did. Morales told the Jewish group that ""sincerely, I have to admit that this was undoubtedly a mistake."" At Friday's meeting, in addition to the Vahidi case, representatives from the DAIA and Morales also discussed international security, terrorism, Holocaust deniers, diplomacy and development. Vahidi's boss, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has in the past denied the existence of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of some 6 million Jews during World War II.

Said Yousif al-Muhafda is accused of disseminating false information about clashes between security forces and protesters in the country's capital, the state-run Bahrain News Agency said Thursday. Al-Muhafda, the head of documentation for the Bahrain Center of Human Rights, was arrested Monday during a demonstration, attorney Mohamed Al-Jishi said. Just before his arrest, the center said a series of posts went out on his Twitter account, describing a shotgun injury, tear gas and ""security forces spraying pepper spray on female protesters faces as they mock them/laugh."" Al-Muhafda has been using the account for months to document what he says are human rights violations in Bahrain. A government prosecutor pointed to one Twitter post, which showed a picture of an injured leg. The image, posted Monday, ""resulted in protests and acts of sabotage that disrupted security on that same day,"" Bahrain's government news agency said, citing Deputy Attorney General Mohammed Salah. The activist's attorney says he was observing the demonstration, not participating. He is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Human rights activists have criticized the arrest, saying it is part of a growing crackdown on social media posts. ""The authorities are placing extensive surveillance on social media, and several were arrested because of their online posts in an act that serves to intimidate others to move into self-censorship,"" the Gulf Center for Human Rights and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said in a statement. Bahraini authorities imposed a ban on public protests in October, saying it was necessary because ""increasing violence has resulted in death and serious injury to many.""

e680e97b0c67b9b5f2e8ad15410ac8d0f5d5c900,CNN,"(CNN) -- A possible constitutional crisis loomed in Malawi following the reported death of President Bingu wa Mutharika, once hailed as a positive steward for the southern African country. Mutharika, 78, died of a heart attack on Thursday and his body was flown to South Africa, according to government sources. However, there was no formal government statement announcing his death, and the chaotic politics of the impoverished nation raised questions about what happens next. Under the constitution, Vice President Joyce Banda would succeed Mutharika. However, Banda was expelled from the ruling Democratic People's Party in 2010 in a dispute with Mutharika over the president's efforts to position his brother rather than the vice president as his eventual successor. Banda formed her own party, but remained vice president. A government spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of the president's death but declared that the vice president cannot take over the presidency. ""The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency,"" said Patricia Kaliati, who serves as information and civic education minister. In a news conference earlier Friday, Banda told reporters she was kept ""in the dark"" regarding the president's condition. However, the Malawi defence forces, which provides security for the sitting president, shifted security members to Banda's residence amid news of the death. While declining to comment on the president's condition, Kaliati appealed to Malawi residents to remain calm and only listen to information coming from official government sources. The United States and Britain have urged Malawi to observe the succession process in the constitution. ""We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power. We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly,"" said Johnnie Carson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. During her news conference, Banda, along with former President Bakili Muluzi, called on Malawians to adhere to the constitution regarding the issue of succession. Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries, was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an ""economic engineer."" He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014. His initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy. He implemented a subsidy program for agricultural products that was credited with boosting the economy of the largely agrarian nation. Malawians welcomed his focus on reducing reliance on food aid and attaining self-sufficiency. However, his popularity plunged in recent years as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts. Anti-government groups accused Mutharika of dragging Malawi back into a dictatorship, citing the passage of bills they say infringe on citizen rights. Protesters took to the streets last year demanding immediate government action to address the economic plight. Security forces cracked down, leading to more than a dozen deaths and sparking international condemnation. Critics also accused Mutharika of jeopardizing international relations and risking foreign aid that benefits the nation's poor. Last year, Mutharika expelled a British envoy who was quoted criticizing him in a leaked diplomatic cable, straining relations with one of Malawi's largest foreign donors. In return, Britain asked Malawi's top envoy to leave the country and rescinded her invitation to the royal wedding. At the time, London said it was halting ""all general budget support"" to the nation. Last month, the United States announced it was suspending $350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its democratic governance.

8986bae56f553b23e113ef20805d79b3602e43ed,CNN,"(CNN) -- The international draw of its star players, the huge sums paid for rights to broadcast live action and the loyal nature of its consumers have long made the English Premier League an attractive home for investors. In recent years this has included a number of American billionaires who, having made their money with sport franchises in the United States, saw ownership of teams including Manchester United (Malcolm Glazer), Liverpool (Hicks and Gillett) and Aston Villa (Randy Lerner) as the best way to expand a global portfolio. Stan Kroenke -- owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche and Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids -- could be the next to join this elite group after a major shareholder at London-based Arsenal confirmed that she is looking to sell her stake. Kroenke already owns 29 percent of the Champions League quarterfinalists, and needs only one more percent to trigger a complete takeover. Blog: Should Stan Kroenke buy Arsenal? But with the economic downturn compounding both Liverpool and Manchester United's struggles with debt and growing fan unrest -- coupled with Kroenke's recent confirmation of a takeover bid for the St Louis Rams -- would it be wise for the American to aim his sights on owning Arsenal now? CNN's business correspondent Jim Boulden helps break down Kroenke's decision. Why invest in the English Premier League? The recent sale of their overseas television rights amounted to over $1.5 billion, while the domestic rights went for much more. This means the Premier League clubs can sign expensive players on big wages, according to Boulden. ""A lot of the league's strength is to do with Sky and its multi-billion dollar deal to show the games around the world,"" he said. ""Sky gives an enormous amount of money to Premier League clubs."" Could Kroenke expect much profit from Arsenal? Boulden says the main way to maximize profit is to keep a club healthy, and deliver success on the pitch before selling it on down the line for a profit. He said: ""I look upon Stan Kroenke like these other guys in America: the Glazers own a NFL team, the guys who own Liverpool own hockey clubs in America. They only make money if they hold onto them for a really long time and sell them."" Is Arsenal a financially healthy club? Yes, according to Boulden. He says the club had to take out a big loan to build its new stadium -- the Emirates, which opened in 2006 -- but that is being chipped away. He explained: ""There is a small section of seats at Arsenal's new ground that generates as much money on a match day as the entire former ground did. All other seats are gravy, so the amount of money they make per game is phenomenal."" The site of the former ground has been turned into flats, which has also generated a considerable amount of money, Boulden said. Boulden believes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move. ""Arsene Wenger's theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs haven't even noticed them. By the time they come good, and most of them do, he would have to pay $20 million to get these guys."" He says these players can also be sold on for huge profit, like in the case of France striker Nicolas Anelka, who came through the Arsenal youth system before being sold to Real Madrid for $35 million. Would Kroenke put the club in debt to buy it, as did the owners of Manchester United and Liverpool? The Glazer family bought Manchester United by putting the debt onto the club, and their most recent accounts show they are over $1 billion in debt. Boulden says any similar move at Arsenal may not do the club any good. ""Arsenal already has a debt from the building of the new stadium, so it would be hard to see how Kroenke would get a bank to agree to give them more debt,"" he said. Does Kroenke's extra investment in the St Louis Rams limit his spending power? Boulden says Kroenke's purchase of the Rams makes it very unlikely he would also fight to acquire Arsenal at the same time: ""The fact that he has just ingested the Rams -- one of the worst teams in the NFL -- means he is going to have to spend his time and effort trying to rebuild that club. It's hard to see that he would do that and try to take over Arsenal -- that would be a lot for one person to take on.""",7,10.662719815981937

58916e736b059f937ce927e0bcc28fce1fea35fa,CNN,"(CNN) -- Authorities in Mississippi are holding a father of five in the deaths of his children, ages 1 to 8, the state's Department of Public Safety said Tuesday evening. ""The seriousness of this violent crime is unconscionable,"" said Albert Santa Cruz, Mississippi's public safety commissioner. Timothy Jones Jr., 32, is being held in Smith County on child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution. The children, reported missing from South Carolina last week, were found dead in Alabama on Tuesday, authorities said. Their remains were discovered off a dirt road in Wilcox County, said Sgt. Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Jones led law enforcement to the crime scene, Jarrett said. No other details were immediately available about how the children died. A multi-state search for the children and their father involved the FBI and state law enforcement agencies. It was launched after the mother told Lexington County, South Carolina, sheriff's investigators on September 3 that she has been unable to contact her former husband. ""Neighbors told deputies that the children's father said he was moving with his children from his home near Lexington to another state,"" said Lexington Sheriff Lewis McCarty. Jones and the children's mother were divorced. They shared custody of the children, according to the Lexington County, South Carolina, Sheriff's office. On Saturday, Jones was taken into custody in Mississippi on suspicion of driving under the influence. When his SUV was towed, authorities found evidence of a crime, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A check of the National Criminal Information Center found he was wanted in South Carolina.

4365b079246cf19f1dc203f79260ca1a837d6ac4,CNN,"(CNN) -- This is no treasure hunt for a casket of gold at the bottom of the ocean. Instead, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, with this search potentially for no more than a few partly rotten timber frames on Newport Harbor's sea floor. For years, the whereabouts of one of the most famous ships in nautical history -- HMS Endeavour -- has remained a mystery. ""I don't like to call it treasure as there's no gold or silver,"" Dr Kathy Abbass, the executive director of Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, a not-for-profit organization set up in 1992 set up to study the area's maritime history, told CNN. ""But it's an intellectual treasure."" The Endeavour is now believed to have been intentionally sunk -- in a new life and under a new name -- during the American Revolution in 1778. Endeavour is endemic to every Australian and New Zealand child's education with a rich British and American history to boot. It was the boat on which Captain James Cook achieved the first recorded contact with the east coast of Australia, Hawaii, and the first circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook also provided the first accurate map of the Pacific and is believed to have shaped the world map more than any other explorer in history. So how exactly did the British Royal Navy vessel get from exploring undiscovered far flung lands to lying in waters off the east coast of the United States, sharing the ocean floor with torpedoes and other 18th Century vessels? A visit by Abbass to the Public Records' Office, now The National Archives, in London uncovered the fact that Endeavour had been sold into private hands and was known as the Lord Sandwich by the time of its demise. ""Lord Sandwich was the first lord of the admiralty at the time so the name makes sense -- a nod by its private owner,"" she says. ""We know from its size, dimension and these records that the Sandwich was the Endeavour."" In its new guise, it was used to house Patriot prisoners before it was one of 13 ships scuttled in a bid to stop a French invasion at Rhode Island. ""The American army was assembled on the mainland and the French sent a fleet to help,"" she continues. ""There's speculation that had the French fleet succeeded on that day, the revolution would have ended in Rhode Island rather than linger on for five more years. ""The British knew they were at great risk so they ordered 13 ships out to be scuttled in a line to blockade the city. They were sunk in fairly shallow waters. The French realized they couldn't get close to the city and had to stay away but they still cannoned the city."" It is a far cry from its previous existence, arriving in Botany Bay (part of the greater metropolis that is Sydney now) in 1770. It was a voyage on which it first came close to its demise by running aground on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a section later renamed Endeavour Reef, which Cook navigated in the dark and from which he escaped by ditching weapons on board to lighten the load of the vessel. It is now believed to rest alongside 12 other vessels in a two-square-mile area where that conjoined scuttling took place eight years later. Nine of the ships have already been located -- the most recent just last month -- and there is every chance that Endeavour could already be among those nine, although reaching that conclusion is a slow and pain-staking process. Simple math would suggest there is a 70% chance Abbass and her team have already dived among the 300-tonne ship's ruins. In recent weeks, the quest has been picked up courtesy of a new partnership with Australian Maritime Museum, located in Sydney just a short boat ride from the Botany Bay that Cook first encountered. Head of research Dr Nigel Erskine is a maritime archaeologist whose Phd was on HMS Bounty and who has dived with regularity in Newport Harbor. In Australia, the countdown has begun to 2020 and the 250-year anniversary of Cook's arrival on Australian soil. Erskine admits that finding the ship, of which a replica has been made and was launched in 2012, would be a major fillip. ""I'm 60 years old and growing up there was a picture of Captain Cook and the Queen in most school rooms,"" he recalls. ""It's obviously a massive part of Australia's heritage."" However, finding Endeavour is no certainty. He adds: ""It's absolutely possible it might have been destroyed. Newport Harbour is very busy and there's 13 ships there, American and English. It's like an underwater jigsaw puzzle."" The search is done using a variety of methods such as sight sonar, which he likens ""to shining a torch on the ocean floor"", as well as GPS. Abbass is a realist too but is confident in the outcome. ""I don't know if we'll find all 13 but I think we have a good chance,"" she says. ""It may have been salvaged or destroyed when the harbor was dredged but we don't think that happened. We have a great chance of finding Endeavour."" Unlike her Australian counterparts, she is not solely obsessed with finding the one ship but with all of them, in her quest for greater maritime knowledge of American and British vessels at that time. If and when Endeavour is properly found, who does she belong to? All Royal Navy vessels still belong to Britain wherever they end up coming to rest. Privately owned vessels, however, like the Lord Sandwich, as she became known, are a different matter. And when uncovered she will belong to Rhode Island, although getting to that point was not without its concerns. ""There's no gold in the vessel so there wasn't an issue of treasure salvers,"" she explains. ""But with the history of Endeavour, there was a concern of someone trying to get to her. But a law is now in place that she belongs to Rhode Island although that doesn't mean we won't share her."" The waters in the harbor are murky and visibility, at best, is no more than six feet. That combined with the cost of equipment and man power -- with limited financial resources -- makes it a slow process. The state of preservation depends how much the timber frames of the vessels are under silt, which because of their lack of oxygen effectively preserve the wood. For Abbass, those murky waters have become her life's work. The search for that particular treasure goes on.",7,10.215659144161021

Sandra Samuel bravely saved the life of Moshe Holtzberg, 2, but says she sees no heroism in her actions. But Sandra Samuel sees no heroism in her actions amid last week's terror attacks on India's financial capital that killed nearly 180 people -- including baby Moshe's parents, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. She only wishes she could have done more. ""Even today, I am thinking I should have sent the baby and done something for the rabbi and his wife,"" Samuel told CNN in an exclusive television interview in Israel, where she now lives.

She found the child crying as he stood between his parents, who she says appeared unconscious but still alive. Based on the marks on Moshe's back, she believes he was struck so hard by a gunman that he fell unconscious at some point as well. ""First thing is that a baby is very important for me and this baby is something very precious to me and that's what made me just not think anything -- just pick up the baby and run,"" Samuel said.

Peter Boone is chairman of Effective Intervention, a UK-based charity, and a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics. They run http://baselinescenario.com/, a global economy Web site. Simon Johnson, above, and Peter Boone say the U.S. could be in for a long period of virtually no growth. (CNN) -- Euphoria returns! Who could have guessed that Bank of America stock would rally 70 percent the week it learns the Feds are demanding new capital equal to nearly half the bank's market capitalization? The ongoing grim news -- on rising unemployment, continued (albeit slower) economic decline, and ordinary working Americans being hammered on all sides -- is being ignored by stock and commodity markets. Is America now back on track for growth? The answer to that is almost surely no. Rising stock markets don't necessarily mean a sharp recovery is under way. Consider the case of Japan in its first lost decade of the 1990s. After falling 63 percent from its peak in late 1989, the Nikkei staged a 32 percent rally in one month. It then remained volatile but around the same level for nearly 10 years -- because the return on assets and capital investors could earn proved so low throughout that economy. During the 1990s, Japan's banking system was burdened with bad loans that kept eating into profits and its nonfinancial companies had excess capacity that had to be wound down; these problems were made worse by a decline in the working population. The initial excess of capital, supplemented by high ongoing savings from households and corporations, kept interest rates low. Throughout this period the price/earnings ratio on stocks ranged from 30 to 50 (it's 51 today), compared with 15 to 20 in Europe and the United States. The logic was simple: With so little return available on all assets, local investors were willing to pay up for stocks even if the dividends were a paltry 1-2 percent. Does this sound familiar? We think so. The current rally in stocks marks one clear success -- the fear of a systemic collapse due to loss of confidence in our financial system has subsided. This is good news, and an important achievement of President Obama's team. However, our ""turning Japanese"" phase may just have begun. The ""stress tests"" that were just completed do not mark the renewed health of our banking system. We still have 22 percent of Americans with houses worth less than their mortgages, and there are parallel problems for commercial property and other sectors. Many bankruptcies are yet to come. Most publicly traded large homebuilders are deep in debt, yet they are burning cash and waiting to see if -- magically -- the two-year stock of unsold housing can somehow disappear. We've barely begun to downsize our auto industry, and the parts suppliers and dealers that go along with it, to reflect the lower level of consumer spending and scarcer availability of credit for the future. All of this is also true across much of Europe. In essence, Europe and the United States both are saddled with zombie banks (which don't really lend), zombie corporations (which don't grow), and a decline in the relative size of the working population (as more people try to retire). This ""Japanese"" scenario can persist for many years. The biggest risk now is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury try to re-leverage our way out of a Japanese-style prolonged recession by flooding the economy with cheap credit -- like they did in 2002, but to an even greater degree. Cheap government finance for powerful banks is a great cocktail for re-election; running stress tests that weren't really stressful is a good indication this is where policy is heading. This time the money won't come from consumers (or from China, as it did after 2002); it will be American and European central banks providing funds and our governments running massive budget deficits. If this is the strategy, the next crisis will be even more traumatic. Budget deficits over 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product and trillions of dollars of new loans to the banks from the Federal Reserve are recipes for hyperinflation and, if the Fed and Treasury don't pull away the punch bowl soon, sharply increasing inflation is very much in the cards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Johnson and Peter Boone.",7,12.23690437755585

1cd6245a290e39114c0fb2f3cc01e5d7cc345e02,CNN,"(CNN)French officials are still trying to determine what caused gunmen to attack a satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. But, according to French media, the gunmen yelled, ""We have avenged the Prophet!"" as they stormed the office. Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine attacked on Wednesday, has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. The prohibition again illustrating the Prophet Mohammed began as a attempt to ward off idol worship, which was widespread in Islam's Arabian birthplace. But in recent years, that prohibition has taken on a deadly edge. A  central tenet of Islam is that Mohammed was a man, not God, and that portraying him could lead to revering him in lieu of Allah. ""It's all rooted in the notion of idol worship,"" Akbar Ahmed, who chairs the Islamic Studies department at American University told CNN. ""In Islam, the notion of God versus any depiction of God or any sacred figure is very strong."" In some ways, Islam was a reaction against Christianity, which early Muslims believed had been led astray by conceiving of Christ, not as a man but as a God. They didn't want the same thing to happen to Mohammed. ""The prophet himself was aware that if people saw his face portrayed by people, they would soon start worshiping him,"" Ahmed told CNN. ""So he himself spoke against such images, saying 'I'm just a man.' "" In a bitter irony, the sometimes violent attacks against portrayals of the prophet are kind of reverse idol-worship, revering -- and killing for -- the absence of an image, said Hussein Rashid, a professor of Islamic studies at Hofstra University in New York. In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo's office was burned down on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. The cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the Prophet Mohammed, with a bubble saying, ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" In September 2012, as France was closing embassies in about 20 countries amid the global furor over the anti-Islam film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked Mohammed, along with a cover that seemed to show Mohammed being pushed in a wheelchair by an Orthodox Jew. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence. ""The aim is to laugh,"" Leger told BFMTV in 2012. ""We want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist. They can be Muslim, Jewish, Catholic. Everyone can be religious, but extremist thoughts and acts we cannot accept."" But for many Muslims, depictions of Mohammed, revered not only as a prophet but also as a moral exemplar, are no laughing matter. Satirical representations of Muhammad are not new, although they are very modern, said Rashid. ""In the context of Europe, where in many countries Muslims feel like they are besieged, these images are not seen as criticism, but as bullying. Violence, as a response, is clearly wrong and disproportionate. However, it is not so much about religious anger, as it is about vengeance."" But even in the United States, where Muslims are relatively acclimated, extremists have opposed the portrayal of Mohammed on ""South Park,"" the satirical cartoon show, and the subsequent ""Draw Mohammed Day,"" that erupted in response. Mohamed Magid, an imam and former head of Islamic Society of North America, told CNN that the Muslim prohibition on depicting prophets extends to Jesus and Moses, whom Islam treats as prophets. Some Muslim countries banned the films ""Noah"" and ""Exodus"" this year because their leading characters were Hebrew prophets. In Sunni mosques, the largest branch of the faith, there are no human images of any kind. The spaces are instead decorated with verses from the Quran. But there have been historical instances of Muslims depicting the prophet, especially in Shiite branches of Islam,  Omid Safi, a religious studies professor at Duke University, told CNN. ""We have had visual depictions of the prophet in the form of miniatures and pictures in the Iranian context, the Turkish context, the central Asian context,"" said Safi. ""The one significant context where depictions of the prophet have not been image-related has been in the Arab context."" Johari Abdul-Malik, the imam for Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia, told CNN that depictions of the prophet 's teachings were sometimes used to bridge gaps in illiteracy. Even historical renditions of Mohammed by Muslim artists were careful not to paint the prophet in too much detail. For example, Ahmed told CNN that Muslim artists in the 15th and 16th centuries would depict the prophet but took pains to avoid drawing his face. ""It would be as if he was wearing a veil on his face, so the really orthodox could not object -- that was the solution they found."" In a  Muslim film called ""The Messenger,"" which circulated throughout the Muslim world in the 1970s and 1980s, Mohammed was shown only in shadow. In  the Quran, there is ""no statement from the prophet requesting his image not be recorded,"" Abdul-Malik told CNN. Instead, the teaching about images comes from the hadith, a record of the sayings and actions of the Prophet Mohammed and his closest companions. The hadith is considered secondary only to the Quran in terms of textual authority, but the sometimes contradictory accounts have led to centuries of debates within the umma, or global Muslim community. Scholars of religion say opposition to portraying Mohammed wasn't generally violated in earlier centuries because of a gulf between Western and majority-Muslim nations. In the age of globalization, non-Muslims and critics of Islam have felt free to depict Mohammed, including in offensive ways. In 2006, for example, a Danish cartoonist's depiction of the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse sparked demonstrations across the world.

98b68822c4c777a9da6ea1ef7f85a9ccd48a765a,CNN,"(CNN) -- The killings we've seen at a Connecticut elementary school, and more recently at the Boston Marathon, are fortunately rare events. Mass killings have remained at a stable level for the past two decades. But they are just the tip of a chilling violence iceberg that has titanic financial and social costs to society. More such occurrences are always around the corner. So why, despite our best social efforts, have we systematically failed to melt that malevolent iceberg? In my book ""The Anatomy of Violence,"" I argue that the answer goes well beyond gun control and is hidden away below most people's radar screen. The true culprit is bad biology. Bad brains result in bad behavior. A new body of knowledge is documenting beyond reasonable doubt that we need to put the brain on trial as a prime suspect. You've heard of neuroeconomics, and likely neurolaw. Now it's time for ""neurocriminology"" -- the application of neuroscience tools to dissect violence all the way down to its root causes. Nearly 200 twin and adoption studies have shown that a full half of aggression, crime and violence can be chalked up to genetic influences. Once genes are invoked, biological influences inevitably hold sway. Genes translate to altered brain functioning that in turn transforms behavior. More than 100 brain imaging studies have now documented structural and functional brain impairments in aggressive adolescents and violent adult offenders. Brain dysfunction is just as much a cause of crime as bad neighborhoods and poverty. Yet it has been ignored because while it's easy to see bad neighborhoods, it's harder to peer inside a person's head. By ignoring these biological influences, we are turning our backs on finding an antidote and instead face more future violence. The seeds of sin are sown early in life -- and not just by genes. Toxic early environments also worsen brain functioning. Mothers who smoke or drink during pregnancy double or triple the odds of their babies becoming violent offenders decades later, even after accounting for other social influences. Birth complications also predispose to adult violence, especially when combined with negative home environments. Born bad? Not exactly. But early biological predispositions beyond the individual's control propelling them on a flight path to violence? Absolutely. We aren't exactly what we eat, but not eating enough can make for malevolence. Poor nutrition during pregnancy almost triples the rate of antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. Children with poor nutrition at age 3 are more aggressive and antisocial in the teenage years after controlling for a host of social adversity factors. All of these early influences impair brain structure and function, and they contribute to the brain impairments we find in criminals and psychopaths in later life. Kids' brains may hold clues to future criminals . Is biology destiny? No, it's not. We can change these biological menaces that threaten to create the violent offender. We know from dozens of randomized controlled trials that medications ranging from stimulants to antipsychotics to mood stabilizers are surprisingly effective in reducing aggression in children and adolescents. There's no question that medications that reduce testosterone in adult sex offenders also diminish sexual drive and also incidents of sex offenses. Biological interventions need not be draconian, and it's never too early to stop the rot. Providing nurse visitations to poor mothers where advice is given on reducing smoking and alcohol use cuts juvenile delinquency in half 15 years later. Early environmental enrichments that include better nutrition, more exercise and cognitive stimulation from ages 3 to 5 both improves brain functioning at age 11 and also reduces crime at age 23 by 35%. We can prevent violence by enhancing early brain development and reducing exposure to toxins. While it's never too early to stop the rot, it's never too late, either. Two randomized controlled trials in England and the Netherlands have shown that supplementing the diets of young prisoners with omega-3 reduced serious offending by 35%. Omega-3 is a long-chain fatty acid critical for brain structure and function. It's not a final solution, but isn't it worth further consideration? We all too often wait until it's too late. We prefer to avoid awkward scientific findings on the biology of violence that question our concepts of free will and punishment and harken back to the bad old days of eugenics and brain lobectomies. These are the two edges of the sword that have killed off advances in violence prevention in the past decades. In my book, I argue that we should instead grasp the neuroethical nettles that threaten to choke the growth of the new field neurocriminology, recognize that there is more to crime than bad environments, and attack the brain basis to violence. If we were to promote a minimal biological baseline for the healthy brain development of every child in society to reduce the likelihood of future violence of the type we saw at Sandy Hook Elementary School, is that really eugenics? Not it's not. Better brains can make for better behavior for some, and a better future for all. More on the criminal brain: Nature vs. nurture .

bb2a4b1d1014b006ce028e961fe724faa73aea7b,CNN,"(CNN) -- A man was killed by a grizzly bear Wednesday morning at Yellowstone National Park, according to the National Park Service. The visitor was hiking with his wife along the Wapiti Lake trail when he surprised a female bear with her cubs, the park service said. The bear attacked and fatally wounded the man in an attempt to defend her cubs. A group of nearby hikers called police after they heard the victim's wife crying for help. The name of the victim is being withheld pending notification of family members. There have been no reports of bear encounters along or near the Wapiti Lake trail this season, park spokesman Al Nash said in the statement. A bear warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points. All trails and back-country campsites have been closed until further notice. Park rangers are working to clear the area of all back-country users. ""It is extremely unfortunate that this couple's trip into the Yellowstone backcountry has ended in tragedy,"" said Dan Wenk, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. ""Our heart goes out to the family and friends of the victim as they work to cope with their loss."" This is the first bear-caused human fatality in Yellowstone since 1986, Nash said. Bear attacks are extremely rare. No visitors were injured by bears in the park in 2010. Park visitors are advised to hike in groups of three or more people and to be alert for bears and make noise in blind spots. It is not known if the victim or his wife was carrying bear pepper spray at the time of the incident. Bear pepper spray has been effective in stopping aggressive bears.",2,8.791895419252771

205ec8a6e56c6414852629f28928d5515ad5a508,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""The Maze Runner"" ran away with the weekend box office, ringing up the best debut since early August. The post-apocalyptic action flick, based on James Dashner's novel of the same name, cruised to victory with an estimated $32.5 million debut. In the world of young adult fiction turned Hollywood fodder, that's closer to a mega-hit like ""The Hunger Games"" than a flameout like ""The Mortal Instruments."" In ""The Maze Runner,"" Dylan O'Brien stars as the newcomer among a group of teens trapped in a mysterious glade, unsure why they're there or how to navigate the massive, menacing maze that appears to be their only way out. The film's strong opening should help restore some of the faith in YA novel adaptations after the recent weak performance of ""The Giver."" In fact, since the ""Maze"" novel is part of a trilogy -- and since the movie nearly made back its $34 million production budget in just three days -- it was no surprise when Fox announced plans for a sequel before the weekend even ended. ""The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials"" is scheduled to hit theaters September 18, 2015. Opening in a sluggish second this weekend was R-rated thriller ""A Walk Among the Tombstones,"" starring AARP action hero Liam Neeson as an alcoholic former detective turned unlicensed private investigator. Its lukewarm total of $13.1 million was still enough to hold off the weekend's other new wide release, ""This Is Where I Leave You,"" which stars Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda as a dysfunctional family reunited by a funeral. After a month and a half, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" finally fell out of the box office top five, but it didn't go far: It landed in sixth place, with total domestic ticket sales now at $313 million, and $632 million in worldwide grosses. Look for the ""Guardians"" sequel in 2017. On a less successful note, writer/director Kevin Smith's comic horror tale ""Tusk"" managed to pull in just $886,000 after opening in 600 theaters. Justin Long stars as a smarmy podcaster who, while searching for stories, heads to Canada, where a man takes him prisoner and begins turning him into a walrus. Yes, you read that correctly.

7038ea90a20cf0265728d22edc66906b074a9292,CNN,"(CNN) -- Nintendo released details about its upcoming Wii U console during a news conference Thursday. But, as happens in the age of social media, reactions began pouring in just as fast as the facts were coming out. The Japanese game company made announcements in Japan, the United States and Europe, each one talking about the three main points everyone has been wanting to know: when will Wii U be available, how much will it cost, and what games can I play on it? Prices and release dates vary around the world, but U.S. gamers will get first crack November 18. A basic version of the console package will sell for $299, while a ""deluxe"" version -- including additional memory, a stand and charger for the GamePad, and the ""NintendoLand"" game -- will go for $349. Reaction in the gaming community ranged dramatically from joy to pessimism. As prices for the two versions of the console were announced, a split seemed to form over whether the Wii U was too expensive for what it appears to be offering. TheVoices, a commenter on the CNN.com story, said, ""Just can't see myself spending money on another product like this. I'll wait for the 720 (Xbox whatever it is called) or the PS (Playstation) 4."" G4 Network host and reality-TV vet Blair Herter joked on Twitter, ""Not a fan of the Wii U's price but I'm getting it for my kid because even though the child hasn't been born yet I WILL BUY HIS/HER AFFECTION."" However, others were just as quick to point out the history of new console release prices. Twitter user Brandon Whaley reminded people what the PlayStation 3 cost when it came out in 2006. ""I still don't get the fuss over the Wii U price,"" he tweeted. ""The PS3 was FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE DOLLARS at launch."" A Twitter user in the UK offered an international perspective on the price battle. Larry Bundy Jr. tweeted, ""Dear US friends, Please stop complaining that the Deluxe Wii U is $350. In the UK, it will be Â£330 ($533) and ship WITHOUT a sensor bar!!!"" If it wasn't the dollars (or yen or euros) being discussed, the topic centered on the games being offered. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime said that more than 50 games would be available from the launch to the end of March but didn't say specifically which titles would be available at launch. Some games drew more attention than others. ""Bayonetta 2"" was announced as a Wii U exclusive, drawing howls of protest and disbelief from many on social media who enjoyed the original on other consoles. Others were excited about the news. Ally Tamara from Canada wrote on Twitter, ""Well I guess I'm gunna have to buy a WiiU now since Bayonetta 2 is only going to be on that platform. I apologize to my Xbox and PS3."" The variety of announced titles tried to hit as many different genres and fan bases as possible. Many people found at least one game that attracted them to the new Wii U console. Perry, commenting on the CNNMoney.com story, wrote, ""Sold. I was almost positive that I was getting a Wii U before, but with Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate coming... Please, take my money."" Video game writer Matthew Furtado said on Twitter, ""Nintendo Land sold me on the Wii U. Tons of fun with those games today. Never mind the brilliance of NSMBU (""New Super Mario Bros. U"") and lots of others."" David MacArthur added, ""Looking at ZombiU changed my opinion of WiiU. Excited. Hope Nintendo release more than a handful of games aimed at adults this time."" Despite reports of brisk pre-orders, other people urged caution and patience before rushing out to get the new console. Some are worried Nintendo is just playing catch-up to Sony and Microsoft, and wonder what happens when their new consoles arrive. ""I don't hate the #Wiiu, but there's nothing yet that demands a day 1 buy,"" wrote Richard Wiltshire on Twitter. ""can we not be nintendo fanboys just this once please internet?"" James Andrews is concerned about next-generation consoles. ""What's so special about the wiiU? it's just a wii with Playstation 3 graphics and a tablet. Come on Nintendo be more creative!"" ""I'm still not impressed. If it's only 'on par with current consoles'... the ones that are at the end of their cycle... that's scary,"" wrote Samantha (Twitter handle: @reluctant_gamer). Still, commenters generally agreed that the Wii U will sell well in the beginning, pointing out how successful the Wii console sold on launch. The trick is to sustain that initial momentum, many say, will be releasing a stable of good games people will want to play. Two game reviewers said they were hopeful for the outlook for the new console. Max Parker, video game columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said, ""I'm optimistic because of more info on good exclusives. Plus it seems genuinely different from the rest of the crowd. I'm up for a change of pace."" And a Twitter post by Ben Kuchera, senior editor for the Penny Arcade Report, may sum up the overall feelings of many about the Wii U -- at least for now. ""Nintendo Wii U: More expensive than I'd like, software focus on casual, but a ton of potential. Overall? Can't wait."" What do you think about Nintendo's announcement?

Slave Lake was devastated by a May wildfire that destroyed homes and other structures. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will meet emergency services personnel from the fire brigade, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the medical response team in the town before visiting with families affected by the disaster. Later Wednesday, the royal couple will head to Calgary, Alberta, for a series of events Thursday and Friday. William and Catherine are expected to visit a total of four provinces and one territory during their nine-day tour -- their first official foreign trip as a married couple. On Tuesday, William and Catherine made the northernmost stops of their journey when they visited sites in the Northwest Territories. The couple took in customary aboriginal activities, including traditional drumming, dancing and sports, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Afterward, William and Catherine spoke at a session of Youth Parliament and met with aboriginal elders and young adults from the Northwest Territories. On Monday, William and Catherine toured Prince Edward Island, racing in dueling dragon boats and visiting Province House, the second-oldest active legislature building in Canada. Afterward, the couple headed to Dalvay-by-the-Sea. There, Prince William -- a military helicopter pilot by training -- joined his Canadian counterparts in taking part in a ""waterbird"" emergency landing in a nearby lake. In the exercise, which was originated by Canadian armed forces for use in search-and-rescue missions, the helicopter's engine is cut off and it then lands in the water. When it is about one-quarter submerged, the propellers are restarted to bring the helicopter back toward the sky. The Prince Edward Island visit came a day after the most controversial stop on their tour in the French-speaking province of Quebec. William and Catherine attended a ""Freedom of the City"" ceremony at Quebec City Hall, where the prince addressed the crowd in French after being met by cheering supporters. Nearby, a small but vocal group of anti-monarchy protesters gathered. Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. The royal couple also visited Maison Dauphine, a center that provides assistance to troubled street youth in Quebec. They posed for pictures and seemed at ease as artists showed off their work. The prince played a quick game of foosball. The duke and duchess started their Canadian tour last Thursday in Ottawa, Ontario. After they wrap up their tour on Friday, the duke and duchess will head to California for three days. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.",2,6.444229579328485
68e1d848d8fa30f8bdf2475bdc1dd225d55484ab,CNN,"(CNN) -- Investigators have heard a signal from the flight data recorders of the Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last week, they announced Sunday. Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday. ""A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning,"" the French air accident investigation agency, known as the BEA, said in a statement. Commonly known as ""black boxes,"" the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash. The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Moroni, the capital of the Comoros Islands. One person, a 13-year-old French girl, survived.

Chapman's testimony last week was his eighth request for freedom since he became eligible for release under the 20-years-to-life sentence for his second-degree murder conviction. The commissioners denied parole as they've done seven times before -- in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. The decision said the board found a ""reasonable probability that (Chapman) would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law"" and that his release ""would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law."" The hearing transcript and the decision were made public Wednesday. The commissioners questioned Chapman about why he decided to kill Lennon and how he carried out the murder. ""I was confused,"" he told them. ""I needed a lot of attention at that time, and I took it out on him."" Chapman, who was 25 at the time, said his life had ""sunk to a depressed state"" and he was drinking. ""I just saw that as my way out, you know, a lazy way out of my doldrums. It was a horrible decision, but I knew what I was doing."" Decision was made at a young age . The idea of killing Lennon began when he read a book about the Beatles as a child, a time when be was ""feeling left out,"" he said. ""I just said to myself what would happen if I killed him,"" Chapman said. ""I remember that, and then the idea just avalanched on me that this was something I am going to have to do. It grabbed ahold of me and wouldn't let go."" He acknowledged to the board that he had several ""alternate targets"" to kill, although the names were redacted in the published transcript. The commissioners noted that all of the former targets are now dead. Retired cop reveals letters from Lennon's killer . The police officer who arrested him showed CNN letters sent to him by Chapman in 1983 saying that actors Marlon Brando and George C. Scott, former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis and CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite were on his hit list. He made two trips to New York to stalk and plan, he said. His first trip ended when his wife convinced him to return to their home in Hawaii, where he said he tried to get counseling. ""They said that there was a backup and they couldn't see me,"" Chapman said. He convinced his wife that he had thrown away his gun and she had no idea his second trip to New York was to kill someone, he said . ""I told her I was coming to New York to write a book, a children's book, and that I kind of needed space to find myself and she believed me,"" Chapman testified. ""She really did.

""I told him I had the gun, but I couldn't get bullets, and I needed protection while I was in New York,"" he said. ""He gave me five bullets."" Lennon was ""very kind"" to him when Chapman encountered him before the shooting, even signing a copy of his latest album, he testified. He knew he ""could have turned it around"" and not killed Lennon, but he chose not to, he said. ""That bright light of fame, of infamy, notoriety was there,"" Chapman said. ""I couldn't resist it. My self-esteem was shot, and I was looking for an easy way out. It was a bad way out, but it was the way I chose and it was horrible."" Lennon a 'great and talented man' He told the parole board that he realized the pain he has caused by killing Lennon, who he said was ""a great and talented man."" ""I am sorry for causing that type of pain,"" he said. ""I am sorry for being such an idiot and choosing the wrong way to glory."" He's no longer seeking notoriety, he said. ""Got enough of that. I don't need anymore."" ""I am interested in one thing and that's ministering to prisoners,"" he said. ""Me and my wife have a ministry. We distribute brochures that tell people about Christ."" His wife has stood by him for 35 years. She visited last year and is planning to visit later this year, he said. ""I can't believe she stuck with me all these years but she has,"" he said.

Researchers at the University of Michigan said Denmark's prosperity, stability and democratic government placed the country at the top of the rankings, with Colombia, Canada, Puerto Rico and Iceland all in the top 10. The United States -- the world's richest nation -- ranked 16th among 97 countries, while Britain was placed 21st.

0a50865864a332a56d91e2929d8a5cf7a185107d,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal officials said Thursday more needs to be done to warn rescuers of special dangers at the scene of small plane crashes. Although firefighters are well versed about the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris, they may not be aware that some aviation systems -- systems considered safety devices aloft -- become especially hazardous on the ground. Among the hazards: ejection seat rockets, airbag components, and explosive charges that deploy parachutes that can lower the entire aircraft to the ground. ""These explosive components, if they remain charged and are unknown to first responders and investigators, pose a high level of risk to those working in and around the aircraft wreckage,"" the National Transportation Safety Board said. The safety board cited five incidents since 2001 in which first responders and accident investigators who responded to plane wrecks were evidently unaware of the hazard of explosive components. ""In some cases, they began performing rescue, fire suppression and accident investigation activities that might have inadvertently activated the explosive component, posing a great risk of injury,"" the safety board said. None resulted in fatalities or injuries to the responders. In one incident -- the January 2012 fatal crash of an experimental jet near Rainbow City, Alabama -- a police officer became aware of the hidden dangers only after an NTSB investigator told him by phone not to allow the recovery of the pilot's remains until the pilot's ejection seat could be deactivated. In another incident, firefighters attempting to put out a blaze at a Cirrus SR22 crash took additional safety precautions after being told the plane had a BRS -- a solid-fuel rocket used to deploy the plane's parachute. The NTSB is recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration take additional steps to address the safety issue. The FAA should require aircraft owners to disclose the presence of explosive safety devices when they register their aircraft every three years. The online registry is easily available to first responders, the NTSB said. The FAA also should issue a safety bulletin to first responders, the board recommended. The FAA said it will review the recommendations. ""We have collaborated with ballistic device manufacturers, airplane manufacturers, firefighting organizations and other first responder groups to develop training about the potential hazards at an accident scene and to ensure that warning markings meet the necessary guidelines,"" the FAA said in a statement.",3,7.72987467058699
83cb38397e92c83d1f35e49aad4174a6045824e8,CNN,"(CNN) -- FIFA is coming under growing pressure from some of Europe's leading football federations to take ""urgent action"" and restore confidence in the world governing body. Under-fire FIFA has faced heavy criticism over its refusal to publish a key report into allegations of corruption surrounding the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in Russia and Qatar. England's 2018 bid was singled out for particular criticism by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert when he delivered his 42-page summary of Michael Garcia's report last week. But the English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has hit back, confirming he will be writing to every member of the FIFA executive committee asking for full publication. ""I am writing to each member of the FIFA Executive Committee on behalf of the FA to urge you to insist on the publication of Mr Garcia's full report as a matter of some urgency. ""As you probably know the reputation of FIFA was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week."" FIFA had hoped Eckert's summary would draw a veil over the bidding process, but that hope was scuppered when American lawyer Garcia said the 42-page report was error ridden. ""The failure to publish Mr Garcia's report and his statement that the summary report which was published contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations"" has resulted in a further decline in public confidence of FIFA,"" added Dyke. ""We cannot go on like this. Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly."" Dyke went on to ask members of the FIFA executive committee to think of the greater good for FIFA and football. ""I know some of you believe that FIFA's reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with FIFA and I know Mr Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organization he leads,"" said Blatter. ""However, in England we see it differently. If you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about FIFA, particularly those in the Sunday Times, they do provide compelling evidence of wrong doing. ""They cannot be simply dismissed as ""racist"" or ""an attack on FIFA"" as Mr Blatter described them at the FIFA Congress in Brazil. ""Urgent action is needed if confidence in FIFA is to be rebuilt in England. The FA is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of Mr Garcia's report."" Dyke's move comes after the England's 2018 bid team was accused of acting improperly during the bidding process by the report. The FA was accused accused of attempting to ""curry favor"" with former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who left his role in 2011 following allegations of bribery. The report claims that the England bidding team sponsored a $55,000 gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union, allowed the Trinidad and Tobago under-20 squad to hold a training camp in the United Kingdom in 2009 and attempted to help a ""person of interest"" to Warner find a job in the country. A spokesman for the FA refuted the claims in a statement on the organization's website. ""We note the FIFA Ethics Committee has today published a 42- page report in relation to the bidding processes for the FIFA World Cups in 2018 and 2022. ""We were not given any prior notice of the report before publication. We do not accept any criticism regarding the integrity of England's bid or any of the individuals involved. ""We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable cooperation', willingly complied with the investigation. We maintain that transparency and cooperation around this entire process from all involved is crucial to its credibility. ""We also note that after a lengthy investigatory process and assessment, the report has concluded that the 'potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the England 2018 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/22 bidding process as a whole'."" Simon Johnson, who was part of the England 2018 bid, told CNN last week that the report was a ""politically motivated whitewash"". ""Even before it was published, I had no confidence in the report,"" he said. ""Now Garcia has come out and told us there are inaccuracies why should anyone believe anything? ""Mr Garcia had limited powers and couldn't investigate everybody he wanted to. ""He didn't speak to a number of members form the executive committee.""",1,10.31648284820607
5cc06a1ea18e81f464582b29c42be75a933cc556,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN)Here is a look at some of the strongest potential contenders to replace California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who announced this week that she will not run for re-election in 2016. Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have held the state's two Senate seats for more than two decades, setting up a potentially wild scramble for Boxer's seat. California's Republican Party has been decimated in recent years -- with no obvious GOP candidate emerging. But the state's top-two primary system could well lead to a Democrat vs. Democrat runoff in November of 2016. KAMALA HARRIS . Kamala Harris, a former San Francisco District Attorney, replaced then-Attorney Gen. Jerry Brown in 2010, filling a job that is one of the best stepping stones to higher office in this state. In that post, she continued her longtime focus on reducing recidivism and truancy, and won accolades for vigorously pursuing banks accused of foreclosing properties on homeowners without following procedures. At the same time, critics have said she has been too cautious in taking positions on controversial issues like the legalization of marijuana. The daughter of a Jamaican-American father and an Indian-American mother, Harris has gained national notice and enjoyed a strong friendship with President Barack Obama, who could help her raise money for a bid.  At a 2013 fundraiser, Obama called her ""brilliant,"" ""dedicated"" and ""tough"" before joking that she was ""by far the best-looking attorney general in the country."" (He later apologized, and she expressed her strong support for him through a spokesman). Barbara Boxer's retirement sets off wild scramble . During her six years as San Francisco's district attorney, Harris faced criticism because of her opposition to capital punishment. She infuriated many police officers when she refused to pursue the death penalty in 2004 for the suspect who gunned down Officer Isaac Espinoza with an AK-47. But when she ran for attorney general, she said she would enforce the state's law. She followed through last year when she announced that she would challenge a federal judge's decision declaring California's death penalty unconstitutional. GAVIN NEWSOM . Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is best known for touching off a national firestorm in 2004 by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco. Denying gay men and women that right, he told CNN in 2004, was ""wrong and inconsistent with the values this country holds dear.""  He added that he was willing to end his political career over the issue. Instead, the decision helped him develop a strong fundraising base among advocates of LGBT rights in California. Newsom is now serving his second term as lieutenant governor -- an office with limited powers that has made it more difficult for him to directly influence policy. But as a member of the UC Board of Regents, he has tried to block tuition hikes and develop proposals to improve higher education -- endearing him to the younger generation of Californians. He has also outlined his agenda to reinvigorate the state's manufacturing base and enhance the work force, as well as ideas to reduce homelessness, which he tackled as San Francisco's mayor. When he left that office in 2010, Newsom claimed he had reduced the level of homelessness in San Francisco by 40% over his tenure, by moving many of them into supportive housing. Newsom proposed an interagency council on the homeless to Gov. Jerry Brown after taking his No. 2 post, but got nowhere. Pelosi on Boxer retirement: 'What?' Newsom and Brown have had a notably frosty relationship over the years. When Newsom briefly ran for governor in 2009, he told Democratic delegates at a state convention that he represented the party's future and compared a vote for Brown (who had not yet announced) to a ""stroll down memory lane.""  With Brown in the wings, Newsom struggled to raise money and withdrew from the race. ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA . Villaraigosa's long career in the public eye has included stints as a union organizer, speaker of the California Assembly and most recently mayor of Los Angeles between 2005 and 2013. His deep roots within Southern California's Latino community boosted his margins in each of his campaigns, and would give him a notable edge in a statewide race. He was a controversial figure as a mayor -- often criticized for having big ambitions and limited follow through. But he presided over a drop in violent crime and major initiatives to make the city more energy-efficient. Most notably, he doggedly pursued funding to improve Los Angeles' woefully incomplete public transit system. He championed a 2008 voter initiative for a half-cent sales tax increase over 30 years that accelerated funding for expanding rail networks around Los Angeles County, as well as LA's long-awaited ""Subway to the Sea."" (For now, that line won't actually make it all the way to the ocean, but construction recently began on the extension that will run to Westwood by 2035). Ironically, the battles that Villaraigosa took on during his time as mayor might endear him to some independent voters in California, but have complicated his relationship with labor groups (whose financial support and manpower cannot be underestimated in an expensive statewide race). Though Villaraigosa was once an organizer for the United Teachers of Los Angeles, he engaged in a bitter battle with the teachers' union as he tried unsuccessfully to assert control over the troubled L.A. Unified School District.  His relationship with city employee unions also suffered during the city's financial crisis after the recession when he tangled with city workers over raises, layoffs and what he viewed as much-needed pension reforms. TOM STEYER . Tom Steyer, the billionaire investor who spent more than $74 million -- much of it his own money -- during the 2014 midterms to try to make climate change a key issue, is one of the few potential contenders who could fund his own bid for Boxer's Senate seat. Forbes has estimated the net worth of the former hedge fund manager at $1.6 billion. He and his wife, Kat, have pledged to give away the bulk of their fortune to philanthropic and public interest causes. Steyer's enormous investment in the midterms through his Nextgen Climate Action Committee had little demonstrable success in what turned out to be a Republican wave in November. But the Democratic activist has dismissed the notion that Republican gains last year would discourage him from future political endeavors. He told the Los Angeles Times after the election that he felt ""great"" about what his organization had been able to do. ""We set out to put climate on the ballot in a bunch of states, to build an organization and to build a relationship with a bunch of voters,"" Steyer said. He has said he is committed to advancing his agenda over several election cycles. While Steyer may be weighing a run for Boxer's seat, he is also intrigued by the possibility of running for governor when Brown leaves office in 2018.",1,9.741718898108386
789c4bec886eaa4f0f913fc6e51147ff9f53752f,CNN,"MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- A moderately strong earthquake rocked Mexico City on Friday afternoon, shaking the earth in the sprawling capital. People in Mexico City stream into the street as a magnitude 5.7 earthquake hits. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 5.7, and placed the epicenter near the city of Puebla, about 85 miles southeast of Mexico City. It hit at 2:24 p.m. local time. The Mexican seismological service measured the quake at 5.9. People in the city reported the earth and buildings shaking. Thousands of panicked people streamed into the streets as stopped cars snarled traffic. Parts of the city were without electricity Friday afternoon but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Earthquakes are a frightening experience for the 20 million residents of Mexico City, where thousands of people perished in a massive quake in 1985. The city, built on volcanic ash and clay, is particularly vulnerable to temblors. Aldo Pontecorvo of the humanitarian agency World Vision said the shaking lasted about 20 seconds. It came out of nowhere and ""without any warning,"" said Pontecorvo, who said he was in his office when the quake struck. Earlier this month, a moderate earthquake was measured off the coast of Mexico's western Baja California peninsula.",2,7.394364939710253
8f0df7c333ce70325859fcb2893009f8a6dab637,CNN,"(CNN) -- As American families try to stretch their food budgets during the recession, some are turning to the backyard, rather than the grocery store, as the place to look for produce. Susan Hopper of Tampa, Florida, uses her garden to teach her students where food comes from. Recession gardens are catching on with many first-time planters who want a healthy meal at an affordable price. The gardeners are following seed-strewn paths laid by Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt, both of whom have used the White House lawn to show the value of a garden during tough times. The scope of today's trend is shocking even to those in the gardening industry. W. Atlee Burpee & Co., the largest seed and gardening supply store in the country, says it has seen a 25 to 30 percent spike in vegetable seed and plant sales this spring compared with last. ""I've been in the business for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like it -- even remotely like it,"" said George Ball, chairman and CEO of the company. In 2008, there was a 15 to 20 percent uptick in seed sales because of high food and gasoline prices. Not since the '70s, when the company saw sales increases in the 10 percent range, has gardening seen such buzz, he said. The National Gardening Association expects 43 million American households to grow their own fruits, vegetables, herbs and berries this year. That's up 19 percent over last year, according to a 2,559-household survey the group conducted in January. Tell us about your garden on iReport.com . About a fifth of the gardeners this year will be new to the activity, the survey says. Most -- 54 percent -- said they will garden because it saves them money on food bills. A slightly larger group say they garden because homegrown food tastes better. There's evidence that recession gardeners stand to see substantial savings at the grocery store checkout. Last year, Burpee released a report saying a family will get an average 25-to-1 return on its investment in a garden. So, by that count, a family that spends about $200 on a medium-to-large garden, as Michelle Obama reportedly did, will save $5,000 in grocery bills over the course of a year. That statistic is inflated, said Mike Metallo, spokesman for the National Gardening Association. Metallo's group says a $70 investment in a garden will yield $600 in produce for the year. To get those savings, a gardener has to know what to plant, when to plant it, where to plant it, how to deal with different soil types and how to care for the garden.  Watch the community of Serenbe bring food from farm to table » . That knowledge isn't innate these days, especially for urban dwellers. Bobby Wilson, president of the American Community Gardening Association, says all of that interest is great, but he worries that Americans aren't equipped to grow their own food without some help. ""Many of the people that want to get into the gardening and greening movement right here have never gained the skills,"" he said. ""Many of them came up in an era where there was no vocational education, so there was no need to learn anything about horticulture or agriculture."" He said all of the country's elementary schools should have gardens so future generations will learn how to save money and fend for themselves. Susan Hopper, a 41-year-old elementary school teacher in Tampa, Florida, said she started a garden last year, partly to teach her family and her students about the food chain. See Hopper's garden on iReport.com . ""I have three children of my own, and they think chicken comes in tenders and nuggets,"" she said. ""I was concerned about their health, and I wanted them to understand that food is a process that we're a part of, and it just doesn't come in neat packages."" Hopper grew up watching her older family members garden, but when she first decided to plow a patch of her own yard, she wasn't too successful. Florida's growing season is somewhat reversed, she said, so even though she had read Internet articles about how to garden, she didn't know the local tricks needed to make her plants survive. In the process of digging back into the soil, though, some new gardeners are struggling with the fact that they're several generations removed from a farm. Pamela Price, a 38-year-old mom in San Antonio, Texas, said her garden isn't profitable just yet because of droughts in her state. See Price's ""victory garden"" on iReport.com . She grew up in a family of ranchers and farmers, but she's forgotten much of what she learned when she was young. ""We are fortunate that we don't have to rely on [the garden], but I certainly want to make sure that, in the event that something happens, we would know how to,"" she said. ""It's a life skill."" Price said she's started to look at her local environment anew as she learns which plants will or won't grow in the harsh climate. That gives her a connection with history, too, she said. She recently read a book about how some of Texas' residents a century ago had similar issues. Wilson, of the community garden association, said new gardeners should seek advice from neighbors. On every block, there's a gardener who is willing to talk about the process, he said. Face-to-face conversations are more helpful than Internet searches when it comes to learning about the local environment, he said. One way to tap local garden knowledge is to join a community garden, where neighbors turn up communal plots together. The activity is expected to see a fivefold increase this year, with 5 million households saying they're at least ""very interested"" in participating in a community garden, said Metallo, of the National Gardening Association. New gardeners should start out small, he said. That way you'll learn as you go and won't get as frustrated. ""You don't have to go hogwild crazy,"" he said, adding that people who tear up their entire yards are usually disappointed. ""Get comfortable with it.""",7,10.096947837015522
43c7ec4357d895265cc6b3371f45c15eeb452fa0,CNN,"(CNN) -- Before I set out to travel this world, 12 years ago, I used to believe that the human race as a whole was basically a few steps above wolves. That given the slightest change in circumstances, we would all, sooner or later, tear each other to shreds. That we were, at root, self-interested, cowardly, envious and potentially dangerous in groups. I have since come to believe -- after many meals with many different people in many, many different places -- that though there is no shortage of people who would do us harm, we are essentially good. That the world is, in fact, filled with mostly good and decent people who are simply doing the best they can. Everybody, it turns out, is proud of their food (when they have it). They enjoy sharing it with others (if they can). They love their children. They like a good joke. Sitting at the table has allowed me a privileged perspective and access that others, looking principally for ""the story,"" do not, I believe, always get. People feel free, with a goofy American guy who has expressed interest only in their food and what they do for fun, to tell stories about themselves -- to let their guard down, to be and to reveal, on occasion, their truest selves. I am not a journalist. I am not a foreign correspondent. I am, at best, an essayist and enthusiast. An amateur. I hope to show you what people are like at the table, at home, in their businesses, at play. And when and if, later, you read about or see the places I've been on the news, you'll have a better idea of who, exactly, lives there. ""Parts Unknown"" is supposed to be about food, culture and travel -- as seen through the prism of food. We will learn along with you. When we look at familiar locations, we hope to look at them from a lesser-known perspective, examine aspects unfamiliar to most. People, wherever they live, are not statistics. They are not abstractions. Bad things happen to good people all the time. When they do, hopefully, you'll have a better idea who, and what, on a human scale, is involved. I'm not saying that sitting down with people and sharing a plate is the answer to world peace. Not by a long shot. But it can't hurt. Anthony Bourdain .

6912c6e163f3f51ef30ad7485efd3d8c8308c2e8,CNN,"(CNN) -- Between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion tons of ice in Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska have melted at an accelerating rate since 2003, according to NASA scientists, in the latest signs of what they say is global warming. This image shows the changing rate of mass in mountain glaciers on the Gulf of Alaska. Using new satellite technology that measures changes in mass in mountain glaciers and ice sheets, NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke concluded that the losses amounted to enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay 21 times. ""The ice tells us in a very real way how the climate is changing,"" said Luthcke, who will present his findings this week at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco, California. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, mission uses two orbiting satellites to measure the ""mass balance"" of a glacier, or the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss. ""A few degrees of change [in temperature] can increase the amount of mass loss, and that contributes to sea level rise and changes in ocean current,"" Luthcke said. The data reflects findings from NASA colleague Jay Zwally, who uses different satellite technology to observe changing ice volume in Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctica. In the past five years, Greenland has lost between 150 gigatons and 160 gigatons each year, (one gigaton equals one billion tons) or enough to raise global sea levels about .5 mm per year, said Zwally, who will also present his findings at the conference this week. GRACE measured that mountain glaciers in the Gulf of Alaska lost about 84 gigatons each year, about five times the average annual flow of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, according to NASA. ""Every few extra inches of sea level have very significant economic impacts, because they change the sea level, increase flooding and storm damage,"" said, Zwally, ICESat Project Scientist. ""It's a warning sign."" Melting ice, especially in Greenland and the Arctic, is also thought to contribute to global warming, Zwally said. When the vast ice sheets and glaciers melt, they lose their reflective power, and instead, oceans and land absorb the heat, causing the Arctic waters and the atmosphere to warm faster. ""We're seeing the impacts of global warming in many areas of our own lives, like agriculture,"" Zwally said. As an example, he cited the pine beetle infestation of this summer in the forests of Colorado and western Canada. ""They were believed to be spreading because the winter was not cold enough to kill them, and that's destroying forests,"" he said. In the 1990s, Greenland took in as much snow and water as it let out, Zwally said. But now, about 15 years later, sea levels are rising about 50 percent faster, making the global climate situation even more unpredictable. ""The best estimates are that sea levels will rise about 18 to 36 inches by the end of the century, but because of what's going on and how fast things are changing, there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.",2,9.246087840254635
fefd987f033621e9eb7d45d05a70d23ed0e3d5fd,CNN,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Raymond Thomas is a jolly man who laughs easily and likes to say ""Forget it"" a lot. He'd like to forget the devastation wrought at the Port-au-Prince harbor where his fleet of trucks used to pick up cargo. Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake sent a quarter-mile pier crumbling into the sea along with two of his trucks. The few workers who went into the water swam to safety, Thomas said, but the port remains shut down, and desperately needed aid cannot be unloaded quickly. ""Now we're just starving to death,"" he said, worried that the airport and smaller harbors cannot handle the necessary volume of relief supplies. ""That was the whole country right there,"" he added, pointing at two toppled cranes on the remains of the pier that stand out against the clear-blue sky. Thomas owns Raymond and Sons Trucking, a fleet of 35 trucks that haul cargo from the port. The company employed about 50 employees, all of them now out of work. ""I'm out,"" Thomas said. The port won't be back for a while. Roads have been split apart and buckled, fences have fallen over. ""Oh, forget it,"" Thomas said. ""Forget it. It might take a year to rebuild it. Forget it."" Yet he feels fortunate because although his home was destroyed and his business is shattered, no one in his family died in the quake. Asked what happened, he demurs with a hearty laugh. ""Forget it,"" he says. ""I don't want to talk about it."" He then relents, calling his family's survival ""a miracle."" His wife was outside their house and he was driving home in his red 1995 Honda CRV sport utility vehicle. ""I felt like the whole car was going to take off like an airplane,"" he said, laughing. He wasn't wearing a seat belt, he admits. ""This is Haiti. In Miami, I wear a seat belt."" Another laugh. Thomas' 40-year-old daughter, Marjorie, and her 15-month-old son had just left earlier that afternoon to return to her home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Asked if it was a miracle that she missed the quake by such a short time, he laughs again, saying, ""You bet your sweet heart."" On Friday, he was wearing a bullet-proof vest after someone tried to rob him the day before. Someone wanted to take his cell phone he said, and the port is near the roughest part of town. For now, Thomas and his wife are sleeping in a tent. And for now, also, his mind is on the port. He's not alone. Tug boat owner Roger Rouzier also seem a dim future without the port. ""We cannot receive the help by plane,"" Rouzier said Friday. ""We need to receive help by boat."" Rouzier estimates that before the earthquake, more than 70 ships each unloaded about 8,000 tons of material every month. ""I personally unload three or four a day,"" he said. ""The whole country depends on this port. If we're going to save people, we have to do it by boat."" Without the port, Thomas sees serious consequences for Haiti, one of the poorest nations on Earth. ""We'll starve to death, that's all,"" he said. ""We'll just starve to death."" And it won't take long for trouble to reach the streets, he said. Especially since many of the nation's criminals escaped when Port-au-Prince's prison collapsed in the quake. ""Very soon we're going to have a riot,"" Thomas said, this time not laughing. How soon? ""I don't give you a week,"" he said. No laugh there either.",7,10.444372212563117
0a050dbe85bff2aa1efd4dbeb4628bc6fc9f46f1,CNN,"(CNN) -- With a star-studded client list that includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lindsay Lohan, Julia Roberts and Michelle Pfeiffer, Trelise Cooper is an internationally known fashion designer. Starting out with a boutique store in Auckland, New Zealand, during the mid-1980s, Cooper's ascent onto the fashion stage -- and the front covers of Vogue and Marie Claire -- is made more remarkable by the fact that she never received any formal training as either a designer or seamstress. Instead, Cooper relied on her self-confessed ""obsession"" for detail, as well as a natural eye for fashion. ""I was born a fashion designer"" she says, and soon after she set up shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching. Cooper took up the ""Fusion Journey"" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital. Although it's a city she had been to on business many times before, she says that she'd never allowed herself the time to study its traditional dress in earnest. See more Fusion Journeys . There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making. In her own words, Cooper retraces the footsteps of her Fusion Journey. Trelise Cooper: I absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing. My ranges are full of influences from 19th-century French, English, even American vintage styles. So it's no surprise I have always enjoyed combing through flea markets in small towns and finding rare antique gems to steal some inspiration. I'm also obsessed with detail, so when I find a Victorian gown or a 50s bridal slip that I like, then it's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching, embroidery or beading used at the time. In the West, unfortunately, most of our expert hand-stitching traditions have been lost -- the skills have not been passed on and the seamstress geniuses from the couture houses of Europe have not been replaced. That is why I'm often traveling to India. It's one of the very best places in the world to find that expertise still thriving. From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work. Honestly, I can give them any old historical piece that I've found and they will either take it away and recreate it almost perfectly, or they'll say ""hmmm ... I don't know this stitching, but I know a place nearby that does."" It's a fashion designer's dream! So in one sense, I've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while. However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations. I just love the color and the vibrancy that is India. New Delhi is exciting and chaotic and noisy and dusty and smoky and hot. Everything is so full of intense color and I realized that, on a subconscious level at least, I've been influenced by Indian style ... In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world? Read related: Dancing to the music of love in Buenos Aires . Walking through the streets, you see color combinations that you'd never imagine would work. I recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright, radiant pink mixed with a lime green print. I mean, lime and pink! It sounds garish, but on her, with the quality of the dye and the way the colors had been combined it looked absolutely stunning. We made our way to a shop that I can only describe as a treasure trove of fabrics and other goodies. This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations. There were ideas there, old and new, that I'd never thought about. Already I could envisage opportunities to use all sorts of different laces and braids, detailed examples of hand stitching, with some other antique dresses we'd picked up from a local supplier. Much as I love them personally, I don't sell things like saris -- and I never would -- it's not a style that would appeal to the tastes of my particular customers. However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins. I worked on the new line for many months, and these are the elements I hope I managed to incorporate into them. I think they've added an opulence, a romance. But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it. The garment takes them on a journey, and so my journey with the garment has finished.",7,11.332094266164102
a8aeae4d0113060e3bc24d75f7efe969ae76d17e,CNN,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's National Olympic Committee has finalized the list of its athletes who will represent the nation at the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held at the Chinese capital, Beijing, this year. Thilini Jayasinghe, shown here in 2006, will compete in badminton for Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan team of three men and four women includes athletic sensation Susanthika Jayasinghe; javelin thrower Nadeeka Lakmali; badminton player Thilini Jayasinghe; shooter E.M. Senanayake; and boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. In addition, the NOC has included Mayumi Raheem and Daniel Lee for the swimming events. This time, too, Sri Lanka is pinning hopes on veteran athlete Susanthika Jayasinghe, who will be competing at the Olympics in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter events. Although she stands at No. 31 in the IAAF rankings list for the 100-meter sprint, it does not exhibit her true potential. Her best performance in the 100-meter this year was 11.24 seconds, recorded at the Doha-Qatar Super Grand Prix last month. Susanthika's pet event is the women's 200 meters, for which she won the bronze at the Sydney Olympics, eight years ago. According to the IAAF rankings, she stands at No. 8 in the 200-meter rankings. Her best time in 200 meters for this year is 22.73 seconds, recorded at the Carson Adidas Track Classic last month. The other person to watch is boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. The flyweight boxer is the first Sri Lankan boxer to be featured in the Olympics in 40 years. Sri Lanka was last represented in boxing at the Mexico City games held in 1968. The Sri Lankan media has already begun a huge ""Go for Gold"" campaign to motivate Ratnayake to bring Sri Lanka its first Olympic medal in boxing in its 60 years of connection with the world's greatest sports show.

3d66ae61ce5998c5bdebb05d21417e6dcec92416,CNN,"(CNN) -- An elderly woman who was known as Colombia's ""Queen of Cocaine"" was gunned down in the northwestern city of Medellin, police said Tuesday. Griselda Blanco, 69, was killed by two bullets at close range -- a violent end not unlike the ones that authorities say she ordered during her prime in the 1970s and 1980s. Witnesses heard the roar of a motorcycle and two gunshots Monday afternoon, Medellin police spokesman Diego Chavarria said. By the time authorities arrived at the scene in Belen, a residential neighborhood in Medellin, they found Blanco lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Blanco, also known as ""the godmother"" and ""mafia's mother,"" gained notoriety in the 1970s and '80s when, authorities say, she was responsible for shipping multi-ton shipments of cocaine from Colombia to Miami. She was also the mastermind, investigators say, of countless murders. She was also linked to drug lord Pablo Escobar. Previously on CNN.com: Alleged leader of Colombia's Rastrojos drug gang arrested . In 1975, Blanco was charged in Miami with conspiring to manufacture, smuggle and distribute cocaine in the United States. For the next decade, she lived in Colombia, using false names and documents to hide from authorities. The Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Blanco in Irvine, California, in 1985. She was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. But prosecutors were not done with her. Blanco was charged in 1994 with ordering three murders in the Miami area. The killings -- including that of 3-year-old Johnny Castro, who was shot while riding in a car with his targeted father -- happened in 1982. Talking about her case at the time she was charged, Al Singleton, a sergeant with the Metro Dade Police Department, said police believed Blanco was responsible for dozens of murders in the Miami area. ""If she was not one of the most prolific traffickers in the Miami area, she clearly was one of the most violent. We've got her, conservatively, estimating her to be involved in at least 40 homicides between Miami, Queens and Broward County,"" he said at the time. After serving her sentence, Blanco was deported to her native Colombia in 2004, where she apparently lived a quiet life. Local media reported that she was gunned down as she was leaving a butcher shop with a pregnant daughter-in-law, who was not injured. According to a report by CNN affiliate Caracol TV, Blanco was the mother of four children. One of them is still serving a sentence for drug trafficking in the United States, and two were murdered. The fourth lives in Colombia. Colombia peace talks set for October .",1,6.448259633702479
5690b7fc707e7a5100bc2fdee9e9ddc9b9da0fcd,CNN,"(CNN) -- They left the field with their heads bowed. Looks of shock, anguish, disbelief spread like wildfire. It mattered little. They had blown it. As Liverpool's players walked off the turf at Selhurst Park, the remnants of their title challenge were left in tatters. In the space of nine second half minutes, Liverpool's hopes of winning a first league crown in 24 years were obliterated by a Crystal Palace side which continues to produce wonders. Leading 3-0 courtesy of goals from Joe Allen, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez, Liverpool appeared perfectly set to take the title race down to the final day of the season. But Palace hit back in style -- scoring three dramatic, late goals to snatch a point and leave Manchester City in pole position to win its second Premier League crown. ""It is 99 goals we have scored, which is a phenomenal achievement by the team -- but you have to defend,"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told the BBC. ""It is no good scoring all those goals if you defend as we did tonight. ""There is no doubt. Manchester City will go on and win it. We needed to win to keep the pressure on going into the last game and we did not do that. ""You have to have that maturity to see it through and we did not do that. It was bitterly disappointing and I would expect Manchester City to go on and win their two home games. ""Congratulations to Crystal Palace, they produced a great fightback and punished our mistakes."" With 78 minutes of the contest having elapsed, Liverpool led 3-0 and was cruising to the top of the Premier League and a three point advantage. Palace, a revelation under manager Tony Pulis, had rarely threatened and appeared to have run out of steam. But what followed would have shocked even the most seasoned of football supporters as Liverpool imploded. This was carnage -- carnage which would have been greeted with glee by those in the blue half of Manchester. First, with 11 minutes remaining, Damien Delaney's deflected drive reduced the deficit. Merely a consolation, or so one thought. Two minutes later and Palace scored another, substitute Dwight Gayle firing home from 10-yards to reduce the arrears further. Liverpool, whose defense has been fiercely criticized so often this season, appeared dazed and confused as if it had been hit with a right hook from a heavyweight boxer. And with just two minutes of normal time remaining, Gayle lashed home an unlikely equalizer to break Liverpool hearts. ""It was obviously very frustrating,"" added Rodgers. ""For 75 minutes we were outstanding. We scored three goals, we created many chances, then we conceded with 12 minutes to go and we have to see the game out better than that. ""You cannot come here against a very good side, be the threat that we were and then defend as we did. It is criminal really. ""It is the fault of the team, coach, manager, everyone. We win and lose together. The supporters were brilliant for us. They helped us get in front but we ended up conceding three goals in the last 12 minutes. We win and lose together, so we will take the blame and move on."" It had been inconceivable that Liverpool would fail in such spectacular fashion following their impressive start to the second half. Leading through Allen's first half header, Sturridge's deflected effort gave the visiting side a two-goal cushion before Suarez added a third in the 55th minute. It looked as if Liverpool would simply continue to score at will, gradually chipping away at City's superior goal difference. That it didn't owed much to the team's poor defending as much as Palace's grit and determination. This result will surely allow City to take the crown -- but Rodgers is not giving up just yet. He added: ""We go top tonight as well, with 81 points with a week to go in the season and we are sat here devastated. ""We finished seventh last season. We are ahead of schedule. We have made great strides but I am certainly here to fight and win titles and I will be relentless in that. ""We are trying to build something sustainable. This season has shown we will be capable of doing that. Next year I believe we will make more strides forward and hopefully be up there challenging again."" Liverpool must now wait and see how Manchester City gets on against Aston Villa on Wednesday night. Rodgers' side lead the table by one point but has played a game more. Victory for City would leave it requiring victory in its final home game against West Ham to seal the title. Juventus triumph . Meanwhile, in Italy, champion Juventus celebrated winning the title with a 1-0 victory over Atalanta. Simone Padoin's 72nd minute strike was enough to give the home side all three points. In the night's other game, Lazio was held to a 3-3 draw by Verona.",2,9.049624290031236
5f7a869908e864b70e83282b289ed1274c1f7f0d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Behind the state banquet and smiles from Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's visit to London this week caused a wave of dissent. The UK political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East. And behind the USA, the UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. UK Trade & Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 ""High Growth Markets"" along with UAE and Qatar in the region. As the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportunities for UK thrive in a variety of sectors. Saudi Arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities. The $26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents. The aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities. The UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia, behind USA, Germany, China and Japan. In 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion. While the balance of trade continues to be favor of the British, Saudi Arabia's exports to Britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap. This year, exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SABB. And this isn't all about oil. In the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to the UK were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports. Products being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite the UK's dominance in the sector, chemicals. According to SABB, there are also more than 150 Saudi-British joint ventures underway with a value of around $15 billion. As John Sfakianakis, chief economist from SABB says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. ""The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week,"" says Sfakianakis. The contract between the Kingdom and the UK Ministry of Defence via BAE is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training. This comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia. This probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. BAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business. But as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. ""The relationship is far deeper than that,"" he says. ""Saudi Arabia's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense. Everything else takes a subsidiary part in that.""

245da19bd912891ffdd93da7fc373b802238ca63,CNN,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The identity and nationality of an alleged al Qaeda operative arrested in Pakistan remained shrouded in mystery and conflicting information Monday, a day after Pakistani officials said one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists was in custody. A Pakistani military official said Monday that the man arrested is a foreign operative linked to al Qaeda. The official did not specifically describe the man as American and gave no further details. On Sunday, a senior Pakistani government official said that Adam Gadahn, a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda, had been arrested. A second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed Gadahn's arrest. But a U.S. intelligence official said there appeared to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody. Other U.S. officials also said they had no indication Gadahn had been captured. U.S. counterterrorism officials said Monday they had received no indication from Pakistan that any American had been arrested. One official said there was ""no validity"" to reports that Gadahn was arrested. Another called the reports ""bogus."" News reports Monday cited Pakistani officials as saying that a different man, believed to be an American member of al Qaeda, had been arrested. But U.S. counterterrorism officials said the United States has not heard of the person, who was identified in some reports as Abu Yahya Mujahdeen al-Adam, an American born in Pennsylvania. One official said the reports coming out of Pakistan were a ""real head scratcher."" Rick Snelsire, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, said Monday that the embassy had not received any information about an American being detained by Pakistani security forces. Gadahn, 31, also known as Azzam the American, was indicted on charges of treason and providing material support to terrorists in 2006. The U.S. government has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his capture. He is the first American charged with treason since 1952. Reports of an arrest Sunday came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising a November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. On the video, Gadahn said the Army major charged with gunning down 13 people ""lit a path"" for other Muslim service members to follow. Authorities have targeted several key Islamist figures in Karachi -- the heavily populated port city and financial capital of Pakistan that, for some time, has functioned as a hideout for Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers. A city of 13 million -- with some estimates saying there are 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi has seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan. Many fled there during fighting and Pakistani military offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan, making Karachi a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters.

52a86cf59a19290683054f5f7345cfd2bd9b4089,CNN,"(CNN) -- One of the UK's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback thanks to a profit making partnership between private landowners and conservation organizations. The heath fritillary -- a rare species exclusive to the south of England that thrives in cleared woodland environments -- has declined sharply over the past 25 years as forest clearing has become less common. But population numbers are on the rise again after the introduction of a forestry management scheme that enables rural landowners to cash in by creating butterfly habitats on their property. ""We were down to 12 colonies (of heath fritillary) in 1995 and most of those were very small,"" says Dr. Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, the organization behind the projects implementation. ""Since then we've been able to work with landowners to get the management back up again and we are now looking at 25 colonies in the same area."" See also: Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests . The conservation scheme works by first sourcing locations where there are remnants of heath fritillary colonies. Those who own the land identified during this process -- be they individuals, businesses or wildlife trusts -- are then approached for permission to carry out the conservation work. This primarily consists of clearing the areas pinpointed of their indigenous plant life and repopulating them with the lighter foliage the heath fritillary requires to prosper. If landowners agree to take part in the project, they are then able to sell on the discarded lumber that accumulates during the clearing and ensuing maintenance process at a profit. See also: Brazil tries to balance farming and forests . ""A lot of this is about persuasion,"" says Warren. ""You have to deal with loads of different people who all have their own agenda and financial constraints."" ""When you go in there and say 'there is a rare butterfly on your land' you can sometimes get a very bad response,"" he adds. Although Warren admits the profit margins remain relatively small at this stage and that the scheme itself relies on grants from the Forestry Commission to break even, he sees potential for much larger projects in the future. He says that there are currently numerous sites throughout the UK -- where nearly three quarters of butterfly species have seen their numbers decline in the last 10 years -- being scouted for their suitability by Butterfly Conservation. There are also scores of endangered butterfly species across Europe that could benefit from the implementation of similar cleared woodland schemes, he adds. See also: Can wooden skyscrapers transform concrete jungle? ""There are a whole suite of them (countries) where woodlands are not being managed to the detriment of butterflies,"" says Warren. Yet despite his enthusiasm for the project, Warren cautions that there must be a balance struck between maintaining natural forest environments and manipulating their makeup through woodland clearing. ""We wouldn't advocate every woodland area be managed as there are many other species that depend on mature woodland to thrive,"" he says. If an equilibrium between profit, species conservation and respecting natural forest ecosystems can be achieved however, all kinds of diverse forest wildlife could benefit, he adds.",2,9.48871211531144
94c7eecaf99ce6a49cbccb2578cb81580defc058,CNN,"Durban, South Africa (CNN) -- Your phone rings. Someone's trying to sell you financial services. The person you're speaking to is likely to be sitting in a massive room with hundreds of other people. And if you're in an English-speaking country, the chances are they will have an Indian accent. India may be the world leader in call centers but in South Africa the government is hoping to grow its own industry, so the person calling you in the future could be a South African. Amazon and Aegis are among the internationally renowned companies using South African call centers. British company Coracall has also opened a call center in South Africa. The company's CEO, Philip Lightfoot, says he looked at other international call center destinations, including India and the Philippines, but was lured to Durban. ""The main reason for coming to South Africa was the pool of talent, with regards to the employees we could bring in,"" he says. But it was the South African accent that's proved particularly compelling for his business interests. ""For the UK in particular there has been a stigma around the Indian accent,"" he says. ""South Africa, as a destination, because it has such a neutral accent, especially Durbanites have such a neutral accent, means the UK population is receptive to speaking to individual from South Africa, and in particular, Durban."" Read related: African CEOs look to bright future . Coracall currently employs 300 people, but it has plans to expand over the next three years. Its staff, many of whom happen to be from Durban's large Indian community, are calling the UK asking about customer satisfaction for a major car company. The South African government wants to attract more companies like Coracall to its shores, as well as grow its own domestic industry. It has introduced a number of financial incentives in the hope of achieving this. Companies are now eligible for grants for investment and training, as well as tax breaks for job creation. ""It has had a massive impact,"" says Suleman Shaikh. He runs a call center in Johannesburg that deals specifically with the South African consumer market. He adds: ""It has made the industry much more competitive in terms of attracting offshore investment into the country. ""We can now compete with other offshore locations, such as India and the Philippines, much more favorably. It has lowered the barriers of entry into the market and it really has given the industry that competitive edge we have been looking for."" Read related: Mxit - South Africa's Facebook beater . According to South Africa's national association for companies operating in the ""Business Process Service and Outsourcing"" market, this competitive edge is beginning to deliver results. The industry grew over 85% from 2007 to 2010. Around 10,000 people are currently employed in this sector but that is expected to rise to 40,000 by 2015. ""The industry has grown exponentially over the last 10 years,"" says Shaikh. ""I have seen the industry grow from a few thousand agents to tens of thousands agents. I have seen it grow from just pure domestic operators to at least six new entrants from the UK entering South Africa over the last 24 months."" For the South African government there are incentives too; this is a labor-intensive industry and one that is proving lucrative. Between 2009-10 the industry made nearly $250 million in exports. South Africa's success in this area is attracting interest from other African countries, according to Brendon van Staaden, the CEO of Inter-Active Technologies. His call centers provide services for Samsung and the cable television provider Multi Choice, but he also provides technology for businesses opening their own call centers in other parts of Africa. ""It is incredible the amount of commitment that African countries are making to this industry,"" van Staaden says. ""If you look at the prospects we are faced with over the next four to five years it is a very exciting space to play in. ""We have come of age in South Africa. As a result of that the African states, particularly the neighboring states, have begun to notice this a lot."" It's unlikely that South Africa's call center industry will outflank India's, even with its rising labor costs. However, this industry is growing at a time when South Africa is struggling with unemployment. But it seems not everyone is convinced by the local accent. ""Usually our Scottish customers have a bit of difficulty understanding us,"" says Durban call center worker Rhoda Anandam. ""That's because of their accent themselves, because they are used to communicating with people of their same accent.""",7,11.211512686033753

1eef1343be42cbfb0d76c92524b785e4a794ace0,CNN,"(CNN) -- Real Madrid shot to the top of La Liga on Saturday night after they won and their city rivals Atletico suffered a shock loss at Almeria. Diego Simeone's side surrender first place on goal difference following a four-goal swing on Saturday night as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 4-2 and Atletico lost 2-0. Relegation-threatened Almeria scored twice in the last 10 minutes to seal an unlikely victory with both goals coming courtesy of midfielder Verza -- the second from the penalty spot after Atletico goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia saw red. Carlo Ancelotti's side had a more routine evening at the Bernabeu in large part thanks to Gareth Bale. With Cristiano Ronaldo serving the first game of a three-match suspension after being sent off last weekend, it was left to the Bale, who returned to action after missing the three previous games with a calf injury, to guide Los Blancos to three points. The Welsh international put Real ahead in the seventh minute, seizing on a mistake by center back Chechu Dorado before chipping the ball home past goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo to score his 11th goal of the season. Eighteen minutes later, Bale turned provider with a cross from the right which was met by Karim Benzema who doubled the lead. The visitors put themselves back in the game two minutes before the break with a superb strike from Mario Gaspar, but Madrid settled supporter's nerves by re-establishing a two-goal lead in the 64th minute -- 20-year-old striker Jese providing the finish. Back came Villarreal five minutes later with a Giovani Dos Santos free kick which set up what could have been a nervous last 20 minutes for the home side, but the game was put to bed by Benzema with his second of the night in the 76th minute. The results give both Real and Atletico 57 points from 23 games but with Real shading the goal difference by one (plus 41 goals versus plus 40). Elsewhere in La Liga, Rayo Vallecano recorded a resounding 4-1 win over Malaga to lift the second-from-bottom side level on 20 points with 18th place Valladolid who play Elche on Sunday. Valencia moved up to eighth with an even more emphatic win following their brilliant 3-2 win at the Nou Camp last weekend. A 5-0 drubbing of bottom side Betis Sevilla means Juan Antonio Pizzi's side are now level on 31 points with Sevilla who will be hoping they can repeat Valencia's trick when they host Barcelona on Sunday evening.

He died in a car crash in Donetsk."" ""He was a talented footballer, open and friendly guy. Maicon loved life and knew how to make it positive and bright. Tragic, untimely and absurd death took away a wonderful person from our ranks. Maicon was only 25 years old. ""It is a terrible bereavement for each of us. FC Shakhtar expresses condolences and sympathy to Maicon's family and friends. May he rest in peace..."" Maicon joined the Ukrainian champions from Volyn Lutsk in 2012 and made six appearances. At the time of his death he was on loan to fellow Ukrainian side Illichivets Mariupol. Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna said: ""I have no words. We have lost a very good man, a friend, a colleague, a friend. This is a difficult and tragic moment in the life of Shakhtar and its fans."" Read more: Liverpool hammer Arsenal .

2f866cbd4637990201ffb089231423757e04b7ce,CNN,"(CNN) -- Livestock producers suffering through one of the most severe droughts in decades will most likely have to wait until Congress returns from its August recess before getting any new federal disaster assistance. A Senate Democratic leadership aide tells CNN that the Senate is ""unlikely"" to take up an aid bill that the House plans to pass Thursday before lawmakers dash out of town for a five-week break. The aide said the Senate can't accept the House bill because there are too many differences between it and an-already approved Senate measure, both in terms of who is covered and how the cost of the aid is offset. The drought assistance was part of a broader five-year farm policy bill that got bogged down in the regional and partisan politics of the House, despite major efforts in recent weeks to pass it. But with mounting pressure from drought-stricken livestock producers, the House decided at the last minute to extend disaster aid just for them before leaving town. The House bill would help cover the cost of livestock loses and the high cost of feed because of the drought. With bipartisan support earlier this summer, the Senate passed its own five-year farm bill that includes disaster assistance for livestock farmers and ranchers. The Senate has pushed the House to pass its own bill so the two versions could be quickly reconciled and the disaster assistance could once again be available. Livestock producers are in a different predicament than other farmers because in the last five-year farm bill, the livestock portion was extended for only four years and has now expired. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, warned Tuesday that if the House wanted quick Senate action on that aid, it should pass the Senate's version of it. ""I think that what the House should do is take the provisions we have in our bill that we sent to them, and if they want to do something about drought relief, send that to us,"" Reid said. But House Republicans decided Wednesday they would pass their own language and then leave it to the Senate. Republicans said Senate Democrats would suffer political consequences if they chose not to pass it.",2,12.724175320245372
5f152736cff33983107e1618b381c7c7c743c229,CNN,"(CNN) -- Saying they will not tolerate interference with the right to worship, federal prosecutors announced Thursday that a Texas man has been charged with calling in a bomb threat to an Islamic center that is building a mosque in Tennessee. Javier Alan Correa, 24, of Corpus Christi was indicted on two charges, including a civil rights violation, by a federal grand jury in Nashville, according to U.S. Attorney Jerry E. Martin. According to the indictment, Correa, who had not surrendered, called the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and left a voice message on September 5 saying, among other things, ""On September 11, 2011, there's going to be a bomb in the building."" That date was the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Imam Ossama Bahloul of the Islamic center said the indictment showed that the United States is a ""nation of law."" Tennessee mosque's fate up in the air after court ruling . ""We are used to messages of 'go back home' and 'you worship a false God,' "" Bahloul said. ""This message is different."" Bahloul turned the phone recording over to authorities. ""Today's indictment should send a message loud and clear,"" Martin said. ""The Department of Justice will not tolerate violence or threat of violence against the Muslim community here in Murfreesboro. If you engage in this type of illegal conduct, we will come after you. The right to worship and assemble is a bedrock guarantee of this great nation."" The construction site for the mosque has been vandalized multiple times, Martin said. Federal agencies offered a $20,000 reward in their investigation of an August 2010 arson that damaged construction equipment at the site. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has existed for more than a decade, but the fight over the new mosque erupted when planning commissioners approved the 52,960-square-foot building on Veals Road. The backlash was stinging and included lawsuits and the arson. A sign announcing the mosque was spray-painted with the words ""Not Welcome."" A Rutherford County judge ruled last month that plans for the building are now ""void and of no effect."" Opinion: Muslims in America, it's time to demand justice . Chancellor Robert Corlew said the planning commission violated state law by not providing proper public notice. The county has since been blocked from granting an occupancy permit. Construction on the mosque has continued. It might be completed by July 20, in time to observe Ramadan, Islam's holy month, if the Islamic center receives the permit. Bahloul said the majority of people in Rutherford County are accepting of the Muslim community. Correa is charged with one count of intentionally obstructing by threat of force the free exercise of religious beliefs and one count of using an instrument of interstate commerce to communicate a threat to destroy a building by means of an explosive device. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years for one count and 10 years for the second, as well as a fine of up to $250,000 for each offense, officials said. David Boling, spokesman for Martin, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, said he could not comment on the specifics of the case against Correa. A Corpus Christi phone number for Correa was not operating Thursday afternoon. A message left with the federal public defender's office was not immediately returned. Bahloul said he had mixed feelings over the charges. ""I feel that American values prevailed, but I feel bad for his family,"" he said.

6a8a70d26c3d46d8e625df153909bf392dd68703,CNN,"(CNN) -- He was once a prized asset chased by a host of Europe's top clubs but after months in the wilderness at Italian giants Inter Milan, Wesley Sneijder has opted to join Turkish club Galatasaray. The midfielder, who was part of the Netherlands' side that lost the 2010 World Cup final to Spain, has joined the Istanbul-based outfit in a deal thought to be worth around $10 million. Sneijder, a former Real Madrid player, is due to fly into Istanbul to be paraded in front of the club's notoriously loyal and vociferous fans on Monday. The 28-year-old last played for Inter back in September and had been linked with English clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, but he has opted for a move to the less regarded Turkish league instead. In quotes posted on Galatasaray's official Twitter feed Sneijder said: ""I am very happy with my agreement with Galatasaray. ""I can't wait to wear the Galatasaray shirt. I know that Turkish people are very passionate about football. I feel in good shape and hope to already play in the next match against Besiktas. ""I heard a lot about Coach Fatih Terim and know his career in Italy well. It will be good to work finally work together. Turkish? I hope to learn it soon."" Sneijder also thanked Inter's fans on his official Twitter page: ""Bye Milan, thanks for everything ... Always in my heart! Thanks to all the fans. On my way to Istanbul now ... Excited!"" The club also confirmed the deal had been completed on their Twitter account and their official website, over a week after they agreed a fee with Inter, the 2010 European Champions League winners. A statement on the Gala Twitter feed read: ""An agreement with Inter Milan and Wesley Sneijder for the transfer has been agreed. The conditions of the deal will be made public and the player will sign the contract after health checks.''",7,8.649322178803278
4e25982a81b339d6472f19254e5c94eeabb5177b,CNN,"(CNN) -- Up for auction: Spanish airport costing up to a reported $1.5 billion, little used. Starting price? $150 million. If that sounds improbable, you haven't been keeping up with the fallout from Spain's burst property bubble. The fire sale of the country's first private international airport has become a powerful symbol of the economic downturn triggered by that implosion. With a 4,400-meter-long runway, Europe's longest, on which the world's largest airliner, the Airbus 380, can land, Ciudad Real International Airport sounds as if it has quite a lot going for it. Accepting bids from this week until December 27, the five-year-old facility 200 kilometers south of Madrid also has a passenger capacity of 10 million people a year and, something rare for an airport, star quality. Last year, the Oscar-winning Spanish director Pedro Almodovar shot part of his last film, the high-flying romp ""I'm So Excited!"", at the so-called ""ghost airport,"" the Australian reports. 'Don't land here!' Plus points aside, what the airport equivalent of real estate agents might try to gloss over are the huge yellow crosses painted all over the runway. Like hoardings on an abandoned building to keep squatters out, they're designed to stop pilots landing at the airport by accident, where they could only recently have found themselves surrounded by a gaggle of Almodovar's actors playing screamingly camp air crew. Which would have been confusing. Another downside is that location, which sounds as though it might have been breezily dismissed amid the giddy excitement of the aforementioned 10-year development boom. No one really goes to Ciudad Real, at least not on vacation. Lonely Planet calls it ""an unspectacular Spanish working town."" The sparsely populated surrounding region of Castile-La Mancha is where the Spanish literary character Don Quixote famously ""tilted at windmills."" Indeed, the airport was first called Aeropuerto Don Quijote. Cervantes' hero also gave rise to the word ""quixotic,"" meaning extravagant, unrealistic and impractical. Hmm. More: Man wakes up locked in on United jet . 'Near Madrid' The airport was meant to serve the Spanish capital and the Andalusian coast by high speed rail, but it appears to have been planned in the same vein as other far-flung but optimistically named airports, such as Paris Beauvais TillÃ© (85 kilometers from the French capital). Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Air Berlin flew in to Ciudad Real International, but the airport opened in the same year, 2008, as the bursting of the Spanish property bubble tipped the country's economy into double-dip recession. By 2012, the airport's custom had dwindled to a few private arrivals, including Prince Harry reportedly flying in for a boar hunt. Later that same year, its operators having filed for bankruptcy, the airport closed for business. Only to open up, now, for bids. In a statement to CNN, however, Francisco Perez, one of the bankruptcy administrators, insisted that widely published reports about the $1.5 billion cost to build the airport were untrue. The actual construction cost was only about one-third of that, he said, but it was difficult to determine the overall price tag due to a large number of pending court cases by property owners over expropriation costs for the land where the airport was built. ""We are aware that inside and outside of Spain there's the idea that building this airport was absurd and doesn't make sense economically because it's an airport 'without passengers,'"" Perez wrote. ""Nevertheless...that has nothing to do with reality. ""It's an airport mainly aimed at business and industrial activity -- air cargo and [other] businesses in the aeronautical industry,"" he said in the statement. ""There is a large amount of unbuilt land, zoned for industrial use, around the airport that is being offered to the buyer as part of the airport package,"" he added. Princely sum . Who'd buy an airport? An idle Saudi prince? They probably get enough sun. Amazon's Jeff Bezos could snap it up: he might save on freight. Or maybe Ryanair should actually buy its own airport. They say every cloud has a silver lining. For now, Ciudad Real International is waiting for one to appear.",7,9.030801753241345
7bcb0e435c5bc6c91352a1db4266a0f3efb6a9cb,CNN,"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Indian boy has batted his way into cricket history with a record-breaking innings of 498 in a school tournament in Mumbai, India. Armaan Jaffer, the nephew of former India international batsman Wasim Jaffer, hit the highest score ever made by a schoolboy in a local under-14 competition on Wednesday. It was only three runs short of the alltime first-class record set by West Indies star Brian Lara in 1994. Jaffer's huge total came from 490 balls, from which he hit 77 fours, and surpassed the 439 his Rizvi Springfield school teammate Sarfaraz Khan scored in 2009. Rizvi eventually declared on an intimidating 800-8, with opponents IES Raja Shivaji School on 52-2 in reply at the end of the second day's play. Despite his notable achievement, Jaffer expressed his regret that he was unable to reach 500 runs. ""I am a little disappointed that I missed the 500-mark but as we say, 'One mistake and you are back in the pavilion,' "" he said in quotes reported on the Cricinfo website. Jaffer and his teammates talk about his feat on YouTube . His uncle Wasim had previously broken the same record, but Jaffer insisted beating the landmark figure never crossed his mind and he thanked his coach Raju Pathak for his guidance during the innings. ""I was not thinking about any record, not about Sarfaraz's 439 and not even about Wasim uncle's 403. I was just following my coach's instructions. I am thankful to him for his motivation."" Pathak said he had given his batsman a free reign to play as he wished, having been on 295 when he resumed his innings. ""He is a very disciplined player,"" he said. ""I had told him last evening I want you to play a long innings, so go ahead and score as many runs you want. ""Based on your innings, we will declare the target. But he surprised me as well and created a record innings. I am very pleased with his game."" Like millions of young cricket hopefuls in India, there is one man who Jaffer hopes to emulate when he is older. ""Sachin Tendulkar is my idol. His determination and focus are the things that stand out.""",7,6.053083010088465
7f1f17dcf07a299d8d7bd843adc12a77b29534e4,CNN,"SHENANDOAH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Crystal Dillman says she will never understand why a group of teenage boys beat her fiancé to death. She says she will spend the rest of her life seeking answers -- and justice -- for the man she has lost as she struggles alone to raise her three young children. ""My life is forever destroyed,"" said Dillman, who was 24 at the time of her fiancé's death. ""My family is forever destroyed."" Her fiancé, Luis Ramirez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, was walking down the street in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, on July 12, 2008, with Dillman's half-sister, who is white. A fight broke out between him and a group of white high school football players. He died from his injuries two days later, leaving a small community stunned at the brutality of the crime. A central issue in the case is race in a town with a reputation for being an ethnic melting pot. Witness Eileen Burke said she heard the group call Ramirez a ""spic."" One of the boys who was charged as a juvenile, Brian Scully, admitted telling Ramirez to ""go home, you Mexican motherf---er."" Residents speak out about the crime, racial overtones . Scully was charged with ethnic intimidation. Another teen pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations in a plea deal. But two teens who faced a local jury were acquitted of charges of ethnic intimidation. Dillman doesn't doubt that the attack was racially motivated. ""They said some racist remarks to him,"" Dillman said of the teens. ""Truly, in my heart, I believe they beat him up because he was Latino."" Many in Shenandoah deny that race played a role and say it was just a street fight gone wrong. The young men involved were ordinary high school students -- good kids, according to their families, friends and coaches. Shenandoah resident interrupts CNN interview . It took almost two weeks for arrests to be made. But on July 25, Colin J. Walsh, 17, and Brandon J. Piekarsky, 16, were charged as adults with homicide and ethnic intimidation. Derrick M. Donchak, 18, was charged as an adult with aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Walsh, who admitted throwing a punch that left Ramirez unconscious, got straight A's in school and ran track. His father says he was never a troublemaker. See photos of key figures in the case . But how do ordinary kids get caught up in such a brutal incident? Experts say everyone has biases, and violent instincts are common, especially in young adults. Young offenders . ""Hate is part of our culture,"" said Jack Levin of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern University. ""It transcends generations, it's widely shared, and it's learned from an early age,"" Levin said. ""Even otherwise decent, honorable people can be pulled into it."" Jack McDevitt of Northeastern University's Institute on Race and Justice said, ""We all carry around biases with us, and it's not the extraordinary monster that decides to act on it. Generally speaking, it's someone more like us and our children than a member of the [Ku Klux] Klan."" Research conducted by both Levin and McDevitt shows that there are three major types of hate crime offenders: . • ""Thrill seekers"" who look for excitement and power in attacking a person they perceive as different. • ""Retaliators"" who seek revenge for a real or perceived crime against someone similar to the attacker. • ""Defenders"" who are trying to protect their neighborhood or way of life. Perhaps the most expected type is also the rarest: an offender who may be a member of a group like the KKK and has a deep-seated hatred of a specific ethnic group. ""Hate criminals, most of them young men, believe they are carrying out the fervent, unspoken wishes of their communities,"" said Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report. McDevitt says offenders often ""believe other people share their biases ... everybody feels the way they do, or at least the majority."" By taking action, he says, they think ""they're being heroic while others are scared."" Communities most likely to experience a hate crime have a ""special combination of ethnic homogeneity and a rapid in-migration of groups perceived to be outsiders,"" according to Donald Green, a professor at Yale University. He says a ""flashpoint"" can occur ""when there's a boundary-crossing."" For example, ""an inter-ethnic, inter-sex relationship on public display."" Offenders sense that an outside group is crossing a boundary, and when women are involved, it can trigger a defensive reaction, especially among young men. Shenandoah's rich immigrant heritage has long been a source of pride in the former coal-mining town, and families have held tight to their cultural traditions for generations. But an influx of Latinos in the late 1990s brought some discomfort. Cheap housing and jobs in agriculture and construction drew undocumented immigrants -- among legal Latino residents and citizens -- to a community that was struggling economically. Crimes against Latinos rising . FBI statistics show that anti-Latino crimes are on the rise. There were 595 anti-Latino crimes in 2007, up almost 40 percent from the 426 crimes in 2003; the Latino population in America grew only 14 percent during that time. In December, Ecuadorean Jose Osvaldo Sucuzhañay died after he was beaten with a baseball bat in Brooklyn, New York. One month earlier, a group of seven teenagers with a history of harassing Latinos went out looking for ""Mexicans to f--- up"" and fatally stabbed Ecuadorean immigrant Marcelo Lucero in Patchogue, New York. FBI figures from 2007 show that anti-Latino attacks account for about 8 percent of all hate crimes. About 35 percent of hate crimes were directed at blacks, 16 percent at homosexuals and 13 percent at Jews. But experts say hate crimes in general are underreported. States are not required to report those figures to the FBI. And it can also be hard for law enforcement and prosecutors to prove that a perpetrator's motive was hate, especially if a robbery occurs or the attacker had a prior relationship with the victim. Often, the victims themselves -- especially Latinos who may not be in the United States legally -- don't report the crimes and may mistrust the police. McDevitt says many victims may not realize or want to acknowledge that they have been the target of a hate crime. Experts say communities can heal after hate crimes occur, and even prevent them from happening altogether, if local leaders take certain steps. ""Different people need to be welcomed,"" McDevitt said. Donald Green says a community can portray change as positive, ""saying, 'we've got more great restaurants, more people who work hard, more people who are family-oriented,' "" for example. Still struggling . Eventually, Piekarsky was convicted of simple assault and consumption of alcohol, and Donchak was convicted of simple assault, and three counts of corruption of a minor, providing alcohol to minors and consumption of alcohol. The jury acquitted Piekarsky and Donchak of ethnic intimidation charges. Piekarsky was sentenced to between six and 23 months in prison and Donchak from seven to 23 months. Walsh pleaded guilty to violating Ramirez's civil rights. More than a year after Ramirez's death, Shenandoah is still struggling. Civil rights officials at the Department of Justice are investigating the death and the actions of the Shenandoah police officers who urged the boys to get their stories straight before talking to investigators. But there is no closure for Crystal Dillman. ""It's not done for me,"" she said, ""not by a long shot. That's not justice at all. Not even close.""",1,6.089125422680046
efbcdbeb873b94f4a60e45fc98828cc4a67db6ad,CNN,"(CNN) -- Hannah Brencher never planned on starting a worldwide movement. Her life wasn't going as planned so she looked for a way to cope. That's when she started writing. ""I began leaving love letters all over New York City back in October 2010,"" Brencher writes on her personal website, ""as a way to try to fight off my own loneliness and depression."" She took it even further and went on to write over 400 letters to strangers around the world. Her kind words turned into More Love Letters, an international organization that has sent notes of positivity and encouragement to people in all 50 states and 50 countries. Those deserving of letters are nominated, with friends or family explaining why they're deserving of an outpouring of support. Writing volunteers read the nominations and respond to those that move them. Brencher described the organization as the ""best accident"" that ever happened to her. The letters are as unique as the individuals who write them. A quick glance at the More Love Letters website shows some written on embellished stationary while others are written on plain index cards. The messages written in the letters are meant to touch the heart of the reader. ""Dear Friend, Embrace today. You are amazing, beautiful, loved. Brighten a room with your smile,"" states one letter. Another one is more lighthearted. ""I hope today is/was a good hair day and that you felt confident in what you chose to wear."" Whatever the message, these letters make an impact. ""(The More Love Letters team) received an e-mail from a girl who had been riding on the subway and she had just found out that her mother had cancer,"" Brencher said. ""She actually looked down to the side of her and she noticed that there was a love letter sitting there with all the words of encouragement that she could possibly need."" In fact, in addition to sending letters directly to those who are nominated, More Love Letters encourages recipients to pass their messages on, or leave them for others to find. People find the letters in the strangest places. ""I have heard of everything from in the grocery store to in coffee shops,"" Brencher said. ""We've seen a lot of people start to leave love letters in their favorite books."" Brencher said one book in particular seems to be a popular location to leave love letters: ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" After receiving a letter, Betina Foreman said she sees the value in paying it forward. ""People always want to complain,"" she said, ""but when somebody does something right, how often does somebody say something?"" As the organization has grown, it has expanded into other ways of sending love. Through its Campus Cursive program, More Love Letters has sent letters to more than 100 college campuses. More Love Letters has also partnered with Cards for Hospitalized Kids. ""We realized that there were a lot of children out there that wanted to write letters and a lot of teachers that wanted to get children involved with the letter-writing process,"" Brencher said. ""So we worked with this organization to partner up, to mail love letters to the Miami Children's Hospital."" Even though it can be tough running an organization, Brencher said she continues to find motivation.

2a691ca429e6cee4f0feb61a2602aafd5a101b2e,CNN,"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- Inside a Mexican jail, Yanira Maldonado wept. A devout Mormon, the Arizona mother of seven said Wednesday she's been turning to scripture to survive ever since authorities falsely accused her of drug smuggling last week. ""Reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help."" A judge is weighing whether to set Maldonado free after authorities accused her of drug smuggling and alleged they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Maldonado maintained her innocence Wednesday. ""I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have,"" she said. ""You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people."" The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday, but didn't show, according to a defense attorney. Hearings in the case are set to continue Friday. Maldonado's family denies the charges and says they're optimistic the case against her is crumbling. ""We have high hopes,"" Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, told CNN on Wednesday. ""So I'm just looking forward to that. Hopefully, Friday, I'm praying that she will be home and be set free."" It's a situation Maldonado said she never imagined when she boarded a bus last week to head back to the United States after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico. ""I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,"" she said. ""And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did."" Fearing for her life . Earlier this week, Maldonado's cuffed hands gripped a metal bar as a truck carrying her to testify barreled down the street. One thought went through her mind, she told CNN, crying as she recalled her fear that the fast-moving Mexican police convoy would crash. ""I'm not a killer. I'm not a criminal. I'm just here by mistake because people are not doing their work,"" she said. ""This is not right. I need to be back with my family. I need to be out of here. I need help."" Since her arrest, Maldonado said her views toward the country where she was born have changed drastically. Asked before by friends about going south of the border, Maldonado never thought twice when she gave advice. ""I used to tell people, 'Come to Mexico. It's not true what they're saying. I go every year to visit my family. ... I come, I drive myself, nothing happens.' ... Look what's happening to me now. I cannot say that anymore,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""I don't want anybody to go through this."" If she's released from prison, Maldonado says she's not sure whether she'll ever return to Mexico. From a bus seat to a jail cell . Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. Another daughter, Brenda Pedraza, called the arrest ""outrageous."" Her mother was recently by her side, she said, cradling her newborn granddaughter. ""She's just a wonderful mom and a wonderful grandma and she would never jeopardize her life to lose this, to lose her family,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. The family relies on Maldonado and misses her, Pedraza said. ""I still need her, you know, being a new mom. I still need her advice, her guidance. We've heard that the minimum is 10 years. Ten years is a whole lifespan. We don't have that time, 10 years, to be separated,"" Pedraza said, choking back tears. ""Please, to the officials in Mexico, please do your part and really investigate, because I know my mom has nothing to do with those illegal drugs."" After testifying in court on Tuesday, Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic. ""We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,"" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest . A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. ""Can you imagine?"" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. ""A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed."" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay $5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. U.S. officials monitoring the case . Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, is monitoring the case, his office said. The State Department has also been in touch with the family. ""The U.S. Consulate in Nogales is monitoring the case closely,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. ""They are in regular contact with Ms. Maldonado and her family, and her legal counsel, and they're working to schedule another visit with her. The last time we were able to visit with her was May 24."" The State Department estimates that several thousand U.S. citizens are arrested in Mexico each year. But it's unclear exactly how many U.S. citizens have been detained in Mexico, the State Department said. ""We don't have the exact breakdown for Mexico, and the embassy would not have that information either,"" said Elizabeth A. Finan, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affiairs. ""However, I can say millions of U.S. citizens travel to Mexico each year, and most have uneventful trips. Arrests happen every day, as you might expect with such a high volume of visitors."" Some arrests go unreported to U.S. officials, and sometimes arrested individuals do not request consular assistance, Finan wrote in an e-mail to CNN.

bdaa1b9b63277b8e3b41260b16bd7a2debfa65f5,CNN,"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was given a prestigious journalism award in Argentina on Tuesday, despite his frequent and outspoken criticism of media outlets at home and abroad. Chavez received the Rodolfo Walsh journalism award from Argentina's Universidad Nacional de La Plata ""for his unquestionable and authentic commitment to support the freedom of peoples."" During a raucous, two-hour acceptance speech in front of hundreds of students and the university's journalism faculty, Chavez accused large media outlets of ""manipulation"" and said that in Venezuela today, there is ""more freedom of expression and the press than any time in our history."" The Rodolfo Walsh award, given to people who advance the cause of press freedom, is named in honor of the late Argentine journalist who was killed in 1977 during Argentina's ""Dirty War,"" when military leaders systematically eliminated dissident voices. Walsh was also a co-founder of Prensa Latina, Cuba's state-run news agency. Past award winners include Argentine journalists Joaquin Morales Sola and Tomas Eloy Martinez as well as Bolivian president Evo Morales, a close ally of Chavez. Flush with petrodollars, Chavez's government in 2005 helped create Telesur, a state-funded television network that covers news from throughout Latin America and the globe. Telesur has been championed as an alternative voice to privately owned media conglomerates, but also criticized for its one-sided coverage of Chavez. Ironically, at Tuesday's award ceremony, private television networks were prohibited from broadcasting the event with their own cameras and instead had to air the signal provided by Telesur. Journalists and politicians in Argentina criticized the choice of Chavez as the award recipient, claiming that he has continually worked to silence his critics and suppress freedom of the press throughout Venezuela. ""Chavez has closed more than 30 radio stations and six television channels and constantly threatens to take away broadcast licenses of any media that is at all critical of his administration,"" said Jorge Macri, a congressman from Buenos Aires province. ""That's why I consider it a lack of respect for the people who have received this award previously that it is now being awarded to the Venezuelan president."" The award ceremony in Argentina came two days after protesters prevented trucks carrying Argentina's two largest daily newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion, from leaving the printing press. The action further inflamed an ongoing feud between Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and the Argentine media, which she has accused of unfairly criticizing her administration. Opposition leaders claim that the government authorized the blockade. On Monday, Clarin published a blank white page on its cover to protest the action. ""The Argentine government needs to take immediate measures to sanction this disregard and violation of a judicial ruling that constitutes an attack on freedom of the press,"" said Claudio Paolillo of the Inter American Press Society. Earlier Tuesday, Kirchner met with Chavez at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, where they signed a series of economic accords. Kirchner skipped Chavez's award ceremony at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata -- which she and her late husband, former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, attended in the 1970s -- to meet with U2 frontman Bono, who is in Argentina for three concerts this week. According to a government spokesman, Bono asked Argentina's support in developing medical vaccines to eliminate diseases like malaria and for Kirchner's help in encouraging fellow G-20 leaders to demand that oil and mining companies publicly reveal their financial status.",6,9.174262744646839

The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday vowed to erect an additional 10,000 shelters to accommodate people streaming from the combat zone. It reiterated its request for the Sri Lankan government to set aside land for the construction of emergency shelters, water and sanitation facilities and public buildings in Vavuniya, Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi. And it called on the government to improve conditions at 42 sites already hosting displaced people and to ensure they be adequately cared for. But the United Nations said its access to the sites in Vavuniya had been curtailed in recent days ""and this affects our ability to monitor and distribute aid to the displaced. We hope this ends quickly."" Suresh Bartlett, Sri Lankan director for aid agency World Vision, said, ""The conventional war may be over, but the real challenge now is to foster an environment where fractured and displaced Tamil communities can heal and have a real chance at creating a future for themselves and their children."" Among the pressing issues, he said, is getting people as quickly as possible back to their land and homes. In some cases, that will require that land be demined and buildings be repaired, he said. About 80,000 of the displaced -- a third of the people in camps -- are children, who need emotional, psychosocial and educational support in addition to physical aid, he said. Estimates put the number of civilians killed in the conflict at 70,000 to 80,000 since it began in July 1983, but Bartlett acknowledged that the true number may never be known.

6598edad1734bd91d680b3d84586add92deb680c,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Between 20 and 25 employees of NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" have been laid off and host Jay Leno has taken a substantial pay cut, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN on Saturday. The employees were let go Friday, with Leno's salary reduction intended to prevent even more staff reductions, the source said. The actions were taken as NBC seeks to move the show to a cost structure typical of late-night programming, as opposed to prime-time shows, according to the source. Leno replaced the legendary Johnny Carson as host of ""The Tonight Show"" in 1992, a job he held for 17 years when he left in 2009 to helm ""The Jay Leno Show"" with a 10 p.m. start time. But a few months later, in January 2010, NBC announced the comedian would once again move to his old 11:35 p.m. time slot. The Massachusetts-raised comic's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show. But lagging ratings prompted NBC executives to change course within a few months. That move ultimately led to fellow talk show host Conan O'Brien's departure from the network.

91af15a6dcc7240edbaa69820972e5ab7b69bfab,CNN,"(CNN) -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. Read more: Why China needs to learn the three R's . The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that the top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income and 85% of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries, and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why? The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Read more: Why China won't turn the other cheek over foreign policy . Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. Typical thinking is to attack the problem from the income side by increasing the tax on the rich and redistribute it to the poor. Chinese policymakers are working in a similar vein. Beijing plans to issue new guidance on income redistribution in December. Although information on this measure is still limited, it is likely to focus on the income side by regulating market wages -- a disappointment if it were true. Additional regulation will not only create market inefficiencies, it simply may not work -- if the past is any example, firms will find ways to circumvent regulation. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. Read more: Why China's reforms have hit a brick wall . Unfortunately, Chinese government has not given up the idea of spending on massive infrastructure projects to remedy its economic problems. Over the last 10 years, government spending on social welfare programs is only about 3% of the total spending. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy.

Wawrinka will play Tomas Berdych for a place in Sunday's final, after the Czech upset third seed David Ferrer in Tuesday's earlier quarterfinal.

3daeacfe6e19a65d24d470716d0256e72ecec7ca,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department will not renew the contract of security contractor Blackwater Worldwide when it expires in May, a senior State Department official said Friday. Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad, Iraq, from a helicopter in 2003. The decision was made after the Iraqi government refused last week to renew the firm's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired on and killed 17 Iraqis. Blackwater's latest ""task order"" expires in May, and the senior official said that ""one of the conditions is that you have to have a license"" to continue working in the country. ""No license, no renewal,"" the official said. ""If they don't have a license to operate, we would certainly not renew the task order."" The official said the decision would not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department to protect American diplomats around the world. As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees worldwide, the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq, renewable each year. Blackwater, one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq, has one of the biggest security contracts there. Officials said the State Department is talking with security firms DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, which share the Iraq contract with Blackwater, about picking up Blackwater's duties. The Iraqi government has been unclear about when Blackwater will have to cease operations. But the official said, ""We are working to make sure our people are protected."" Losing the contract will be a huge blow to Blackwater. It has been estimated that the Iraq contract makes up one-third to one-half of the privately held company's business. Blackwater has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq and 1,000 personnel. Earlier this month, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16, 2007, shootings in a Baghdad square. A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter.  Watch why Blackwater is notorious among Iraqis » . Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents. An Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The company does not face charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" The recently approved U.S.-Iraqi security agreement specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country. Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004, but the provision was not strictly enforced. Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate. As of Wednesday, Blackwater said it had not been officially notified of any Iraqi decision not to renew its license. CNN's Suzanne Simons contributed to this report.",3,5.380123076232659

The theft happened late Saturday night at a branch of Credit Lyonnais (LCL) in central Paris. The bank was informed Sunday morning about a fire at the bank and only learned of the robbery the next day, when police said the fire followed a burglary, LCL spokesman Olivier Tassain said.

Tassain also couldn't say how many burglars there were.

043dc7cb1b52e11ea3e4f97f8efeb49ff52c8e58,CNN,"(CNN) -- No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives. That's the message at the core of an ongoing Twitter conversation that emerged after a rampage last week that left six students from the University of California, Santa Barbara, dead and wounded 13 others. Elliot Rodger, who apparently shot and killed himself, left behind a robust digital footprint detailing his plan to ""destroy everything I cannot have,"" blaming the ""cruelness of women"" for leading to his ""day of retribution."" His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what ""women must fear"" even if ""not all men"" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday. The person did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The hashtag -- a response to the ""not all men"" defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on Twitter, zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman's worth is based on her availability to men. By Tuesday morning, #YesAllWomen had been tweeted more than 1 million times. Expanding the conversation . #YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House. While most feminist-driven Twitter campaigns preach to the choir, #YesAllWomen has succeeded in drawing the mainstream -- including men -- into the conversation, feminist writer and political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said. More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence. There was backlash to the hashtag's sentiment, too. Some challenged the idea that misogyny was behind Rodger's killing spree, while others argued against the broader idea that most women face gender-based harassment. But those tweeting #YesAllWomen interpreted backlash as evidence to prove their points. #YesAllWomen's forebears include #everydaysexism, which evolved from the website Everyday Sexism. In 2011, the site launched as a place for people to share stories of gender-based harassment. Today, #everdaysexism exists as a continuous feed of examples of street harassment, and as an occasional rallying cry around petitions. It has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year, according to social Web search engine Topsy. Earlier this year, Maxwell started #rapecultureiswhen in response to a Time.com op-ed calling for an end to ""rape culture hysteria."" The hashtag highlighted examples of victim blaming and was tweeted more than 67,000 times. With more than 1.2 million tweets so far, #YesAllWomen has far outpaced both hashtags, according to Topsy. It has drawn comments from celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Neil Gaiman and Patton Oswalt. Celebrity boost aside, #YesAllWomen's universal appeal springs from ""bottom-up"" personal stories instead of a single omniscient voice in an op-ed, Maxwell said. ""It's not somebody on high saying this is a problem in society and everyone should fix it,"" she said. ""It's people talking about real experiences, and each experience is validated by the next."" More than Internet slacktivism . Even though #YesAllWomen grew as a counterpoint to the ""not all men"" argument, it's effective because it stands on its own, feminist media critic Rachel Sklar said. In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, ""the biggest nerds I had ever seen,"" Rodger said. Rodger left behind a 137-page ""manifesto"" in which he wrote, ""I've wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I'm unworthy of it. That's a crime that can never be forgiven."" ""I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman,"" Rodger said in a YouTube video posted the day of the killings. Sklar said his words echoed sentiments voiced by men's rights activists in online forums and social media platforms, especially Twitter. Those murmurs rarely turn deadly, she said, but Rodger's actions represent every woman's worst fears. ""It's been a collective trigger for women. It's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives, but it's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths,"" said Sklar, who founded the women's network TheLi.st. Despite its grim origins, #YesAllWomen advanced conversation around issues that dominate feminist circles, feminist writer Soraya Chemaly said. The hashtag sparked more discussion about rape in India and Africa, and college campus sex assault in the United States. The hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women, especially in mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men. ""I don't know how anyone can look at this information and not see how densely matrixed all these factors and events are,"" Chemaly said. ""We keep seeing this pattern repeated and people seem to think misogyny or mental illness are exclusive or need to be prioritized."" While there's no tangible outcome to the hashtag's spread, those involved said it's far from the typical slacktivism. It created a virtual space for women to share their stories, Chemaly said. ""While there's a lot of harm that can happen online, the Internet (has been) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists,"" she said. ""Women who were isolated in their experiences by culture and their families for the first time can exceed those boundaries.""",5,11.61215721068188

Then he wounded two more deputies while running from the law. That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect. They critically wounded him in a shootout -- it was the fourth time the man opened fire while on the run, the sheriff said. The slain officer was Sgt. Cory Wride, a deputy who had been on the force for 19 years. Tracy knew him well and thought highly of him, he told journalists at a news conference. Wride worked directly under him for three years. ""He was a very helpful person, and that's what he was doing,"" Tracy said, visibly moved. ""He was helping people when he stopped."" The wounded deputies were hospitalized and underwent operations. One is expected to recover; the other is in critical condition in an intensive care unit. The suspect, whom Tracy declined to name, is also expected to recover. He has a ""significant"" criminal history, Tracy said. Ambush? Wride called in a ""motorist assist"" when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle, Tracy said. The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what ""appears to be a high-powered rifle,"" Tracy said. Then he fled the scene. When other officers got the news, they took up positions at strategic posts to try to intercept the car on the run. Tracy fears the suspect may have set up the situation on purpose as a roadside ambush. ""He may have very well parked by the side of the road, hoping that some officer would stop behind him,"" he said. Tragic chase . After the suspect fled, a deputy called in to say that he was pursuing him. Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said. The suspect raced away but later wrecked the car he was driving. He looked for a vehicle to carjack, approaching multiple people and cars, before finding one. He later crashed it, too, Tracy said. Along the way, he continued shooting. When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said.

16714fcb8037ba1e514866b1ebe451095574bf51,CNN,"(CNN)Romance. Suspense. Good versus evil. On the surface, Rwandan radio soap opera ""Musekeweya,"" or ""New Dawn,"" feels familiar. Like a Rwandan ""Romeo and Juliet,"" it tells the story of lovers from two different villages at odds with each other. But listen closely. Burrowed in the narrative of ""Musekeweya"" is a metaphor for the genocide that took place in Rwanda over the course of 100 days in 1994, when Hutu extremists massacred over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. ""Musekeweya"" conveys a message of healing and reconciliation. Dutch photographer Anoek Steketee and filmmaker Eefje Blankevoort were in Rwanda in 2008 when they first heard ""Musekeweya."" ""We were intrigued by this radio soap, its background and its popularity in Rwanda,"" Steketee said. ""Almost everyone we spoke to on the streets knows the program and can name at least five characters."" Launched in 2004 by Radio La Benevolencija, a Dutch nongovernmental organization, ""Musekeweya"" is broadcast on the same frequency that was used in 1994 to incite murder. When they heard the show, Steketee and Blankevoort were immediately interested in its effect on Rwandan society. ""It shows people how to resist manipulation by charismatic leaders, how to prevent outbursts of group violence and how to deal with trauma,"" Steketee said. The radio drama raised important questions for Steketee and Blankevoort, and they wanted to explore the way this fiction could contribute to real reconciliation. ""Is this positive programming simply a veneer in a country still grappling with deep trauma?"" Steketee asked. Steketee and Blankevoort began exploring this issue first through photography. The story, however, proved to be more complex. ""We came to the conclusion that we needed to provide a context, use the audio of the soap and find a form to tell a layered, nuanced story of the relation between the fictional story of the radio soap and the daily reality of contemporary Rwanda,"" Steketee said. ""A Web documentary was for us the ultimate way to tell this story."" Steketee and Blankevoort's documentary, ""Love Radio,"" combines the story from ""Musekeweya"" with behind-the-scenes insights from everyday Rwandans and people involved in the making of the radio drama. ""This is where we ask critical questions about the positive image portrayed and reveal what is not said on air,"" Steketee said. ""Actors and audience have their say, thereby painting a picture of contemporary Rwanda."" Just as ""Musekeweya"" balances between fact and fiction, Steketee's photographs are not pure documentary. They serve, rather, as ""a tool for the imagination,"" Steketee said. They are moody and evocative and reflect the struggle Rwandans face as they come to terms with the horror of two decades past. ""I photographed listeners in their homes, on the streets, during the broadcast of ""Musekeweya,' "" Steketee wrote in an e-mail. ""These photographs are combined with poetic, gloomy photographs of (guilty) landscapes and well-paved empty streets. I have tried to capture the veneer that covers the complex and tense social fabric of Rwanda today."" The popularity of ""Musekeweya"" is evident in the amount of fan mail its makers receive each week. Listeners identify with the characters and have opinions about their actions. ""Rutaganira and Zaninka, stop spoiling Rwandan society,"" one listener wrote. ""Enough is enough with your divisive thoughts."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Steketee says it is difficult to understand what Rwandans really feel because of an authoritarian political system. ""There is rather a climate of control than dialogue,"" she said. ""Resentments and distrust persist. Inequality and hardships are still there."" Underneath the tension, however, lies the desire to heal. ""Rwanda is doing remarkably well,"" Steketee said. ""There is a lot of goodwill from everybody to restore the community. There have been good examples of restoration of trust and reconciliation."" Anoek Steketee is a Dutch photographer. She is represented by gallery Gabriel Rolt.",7,8.95608171231837
772ad132e8d7c35dca95205fd288f2160a5195b0,CNN,"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. After a one-on-one interview with President Obama on Wednesday, CNN en Español's Juan Carlos López is traveling with Obama to Mexico City and to the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderón in Mexico City on Thursday. MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- It's the return of an American president to Mexico City. Although George W. Bush visited the country several times, he never made it to this city of more than 20 million people, and it is President Obama's first visit to Latin America. Obama's relationship with Mexico started on shaky ground, although the first foreign leader he met with as president-elect was Mexican President Felipe Calderón. Reports from the Pentagon and the CIA considered that Mexico was at risk of becoming a failed state, something that didn't sit well with the Calderón government. Washington corrected course and even admitted its own responsibility in Mexico's growing drug war, which killed 6,000 last year alone. Statements by Cabinet members and Obama himself calmed things down, but tensions arose again. Congress ended a pilot program that allowed Mexican trucks into U.S. territory, as contemplated in the North America Free Trade Agreement; Mexico, in line with the treaty, retaliated by imposing fees on 90 U.S. products. Even so, the bilateral relationship is at a high point and large-scale protests aren't expected when Obama visits the Mexican capital. But there are pending issues, such as immigration reform, trade and a pressing question in this capital: Who will the next U.S. ambassador be? Local media have been reporting that Carlos Pascual, a Cuban-American expert on Europe and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, is Obama's choice, but the fact that he wrote a report for the Brookings Institute on Iraq and the importance of reconstructing a failed state wasn't well received in political and government circles. Obama and Calderón have a lot to sort out in this one-day visit. Then comes the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, where Obama will face 33 heads of state, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who called Obama ignorant on Latin-American issues, and other leaders who want Cuba, a member of the Organization of American States suspended since 1962, to be reinstated. Although Obama lifted some restrictions on travel and remittances to the island by Cuban-Americans, many in the region want more, including the lifting of the decades-old embargo, something Obama says he is not considering. It is not clear if Obama will be welcomed in the same way he was by Europe two weeks ago, but so far the signs are positive -- to have a U.S. president saying he is willing to listen to and treat Latin American neighbors as equals is something the region isn't used to.",7,10.550101685371931
8567fccc013ce1691583bc5628229a1ad73ff350,CNN,"(CNN) -- Civic-minded residents of Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota, found there's nothing like a major flood to make new friends while filling thousands of sandbags. As cities along the Missouri River brace for the onslaught, the ""Sunday Sandbag Thrown-Down"" in Bismarck resulted in 1,600 people producing about 300,000 sandbags in six hours, Burleigh County Commissioner Mark Armstrong said. ""The crisis is just beginning,"" Armstrong said Wednesday. ""There has been a great community spirit."" Over the past few weeks, Armstrong, who has filed several CNN IReport photos and videos of the river and flooding, has been sounding the alarm over the threat to the community. Already, 2,400 residents and 632 homes in the county have been evacuated, he said, adding most of the displaced are staying with family and friends. ""It's going to get worse,"" the official said. ""People who never saw water in their basements are seeing water."" Such flooding hasn't happened here in nearly 60 years, before a system of Missouri River dams in North Dakota and South Dakota were in place. In recent weeks, about 15 miles of emergency levees have been built in the capital area, according to Armstrong. Upstream, at Garrison Dam, a peak release of 150,000 cubic feet of water per second is expected later this month. Heavy rains and snow pack runoff could result in near-record flooding along significants portions of the Missouri River this year, officials have said. Armstrong is concerned that a fast melt of an unusually heavy snow pack in Montana could have devastating consequences. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches in July and August also could potentially destroy levees, he said. Hundreds of National Guard members are in the area, performing levee patrols and other duties. Across the Upper Midwest, townspeople are remembering the devastating Missouri River flood of 1952, which caused tens of thousands to flee. The 1952 flood saturated parts of downtown Omaha before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the current flood protection system, according to CNN affiliate KMTV. The Missouri River in Omaha was at 30.38 Wednesday, slightly more than its peak during the 1993 flood, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Chermok. It is expected to rise to more than 32 feet by Tuesday, he said. Flood stage is 29 feet. By comparison, the river was at a record 40.20 feet on April 18, 1952. It had an astounding water flow of 396,000 cubic feet per second. The Army Corps of Engineers, which controls the dams, said Wednesday that it is committed to the Missouri River flood fight. ""This will be a long, sometimes frustrating and intense effort as the situation evolves and as we work together to avoid loss of life, minimize damages and help communities deal with the situation,"" said Brig. Gen. John McMahon, commander of the Corps' Northwestern Division. ""The Corps is committed to doing its best in close collaboration with city, county, state and federal agencies as well as congressional representatives and others as we address this daunting challenge."" The Missouri River was 1.39 feet above flood stage Wednesday afternoon at Bismarck, with an increase expected later in the week. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.",2,8.303368479246817
b7142861c8529ef7b724fd025eea2478685725fe,CNN,"(CNN) -- A wide-eyed, open-mouthed model of a dinosaur hatchling, the theft of which apparently was captured by surveillance cameras, is safely back in its nest at a North Carolina museum exhibit. Police said the statue was inside a bag left Wednesday night near a rear service entrance at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. Museum officials estimated the value of the 12- to 14-inch-long model at $10,000. Logan Todd Ritchey, 21, and Alyssa Ann Lavacca, 21, turned themselves in Thursday morning, according to the North Carolina State Capitol Police. They have been charged with two felony counts of theft or destruction of property of museums. In surveillance images taken Monday, a male in striped shorts is seen climbing over a low glass barrier into a museum exhibit and bending down. He then hops back out over the barrier and puts something in a large, multicolored purse carried by a female accomplice. Security guards discovered the replica was missing the next day. Police also suspect the pair in a similarly odd theft of items at the North Carolina Museum of History. Inventory missing from that museum included a prop cabbage head, a prop corn cob and prop doilies, along with a real medicine bottle, said Jackson Marshall, associate director of the history museum. They were later found at the sciences museum, Marshall said. Police said the suspects have been cooperative in the investigation. ""I doubt these two individuals realized the seriousness of tampering with artifacts and exhibits in a public museum,"" said State Capitol Police Chief Glen Allen.",1,8.086332893342707
cfa35fb3f1ccd99de710cfee0015724992bee023,CNN,"London (CNN) -- ""Everything I do is centered around women,"" says Pinky Lilani. As founder of the Women of the Future Awards, the Asian Women of Achievement Awards and the Global Empowerment Award, it's fair to assume this is no exaggeration. ""Plenty of women are confident and talented but they still need champions; they need mentors,"" she explains. And, since emigrating from India to the UK 34 years ago, Lilani has become just that -- earning herself an OBE from Queen Elizabeth II for services to women along the way. To mark this year's International Women's Day we asked her which extraordinary women she believes are under-acknowledged for their achievements. From an empress to a humble florist, in her own words Lilani presents her five unsung heroines . Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah (1915-2000), politician, diplomat and author . Shaista Ikramullah was a woman before her time. Her autobiography ""From Purdah to Parliament"" is a mesmerizing tale of a fearless Muslim woman who fought her way from veiled to valiant. Ikramullah grew up in a society where women were not encouraged to have an education, but she ignored this culture and went on to become the first Muslim woman to receive a PhD from the University of London. She was one of very few Muslim women to take part in the Pakistan movement and witness first hand the fall of the British empire. She became a member of Pakistan's parliament, an ambassador to Morocco and her country's delegate to the United Nations. This would have been a colossal feat for any woman at that time, let alone a Pakistani. She also found time to be a mother of four and was a role model to millions. Her book ""Behind the Veil: Ceremonies, Customs and Colour"" is a collection of essays on Muslim society from a woman's perspective. It was published in 1953 but is still a crucial work for a country where, in my opinion, women are not given as much opportunity to progress as they are across the border in India. Constance Spry (1886 -1960), educator, florist and author . My mother used to enter flower arranging competitions in Calcutta. She learnt everything she knew from Constance Spry. In fact, the only book I brought with me from India was my mother's ""Constance Spry Book of Flower Arranging"". Constance had many strings to her bow -- this is also the woman who invented coronation chicken! She created the dish when catering for foreign delegates at the coronation of Elizabeth II. The role of women was at the core of what she did. During both the World Wars she gave frequent lectures, teaching women about first aid, cookery, dressmaking and how to grow your own vegetables in times of austerity -- all priceless tools for empowerment. But for me her flower arrangements are still her greatest achievement. After all, a beautified life is one full of spirit. Anna Jarvis (1864-1948), founder of Mother's Day . As a daughter and a mother to two sons, I really believe in the commemoration of motherhood. A lot of people forget to thank their mother, but thanks to an American woman called Anna Jarvis, who successfully campaigned to make Mother's Day a national holiday nearly 100 years ago, we have this day to remind us. Sadly, before her death, Jarvis became disenchanted by the commercialization of her own accomplishment. She is recorded as saying that ""a printed card means nothing except that you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world."" It's true that Mother's Day has become far too commercial. We shouldn't need a calendar date to acknowledge our mothers, but if it acts as a reminder of how pivotal mothers are then so be it. Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908), empress of China . She may have been barbaric, some even say a despot, but I still see her as a heroine. Cixi was an indigenous girl, an outsider who went from lowly concubine to China's leader for 47 years. It's a rags to riches tale like no other. In a time when a childless Chinese woman was expected to kill herself as a mark of respect, she went on to be the most powerful female ruler China has ever had. Yes, she may have resorted to Machiavellian tactics to get there but she managed to command a respect that no woman in China had ever achieved before. Her resolve, resilience and tenacity should act as inspiration to any woman fighting against the odds. Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan (1906 - 2000), philanthropist and fourth wife of Aga Khan III . I grew up in an Ismaili community so we followed the Aga Khan. I always remember people talking about his French wife, Begum Om Habibeh (originally Yvette Blanche), with great compassion. They came to my parent's wedding in Calcutta -- she was wearing a sari and a mink. I had never seen anyone wear a mink before. It is extraordinary that a glamorous European woman managed to integrate so well into Ismaili society-- she had such an empathy with the community. She was an unlikely national treasure but we loved her like Britain loves Kate Middleton -- she was always out in the community helping the poor and elderly and would relentlessly encourage education for women. Her legacy remains in the Om Habibeh Foundation, whose programs have contributed to health, education and inclusion in some of the poorest areas of Egypt, where her and the Aga Khan are buried. The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of Pinky Lilani.",7,9.90727620702392
be2014662816631eb96149061c2e5fd64adcc57f,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 40 years after members of a U.S. cavalry unit put their lives in peril to save 100 fellow soldiers trapped under blistering enemy fire in Vietnam, they received the Presidential Unit Citation on Tuesday. Veterans watch Tuesday's ceremony, which recognized members of a U.S. cavalry unit. It's an honor their captain says is long overdue. President Obama awarded the citation for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry to 86 members of the Army's Troop A, First Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. ""These soldiers defined the meaning of bravery and heroism,"" Obama said at a White House reception honoring the group's heroics. ""It's never too late. You can never say it enough. ... We honor your service, and America is forever grateful."" On March 26, 1970, the 120-member Troop A volunteered to rescue an American infantry company surrounded by an overwhelming enemy force at a site on the Cambodian border called the Dog's Face. The enemy had survived hours of aerial and artillery bombardment and was expected to kill or capture the 100 American infantrymen in Company C within hours. The Americans were running out of ammunition and could not move because of heavy casualties. There were no available landing zones for medical and rescue helicopters to touch down. Alpha Troop heard of their plight on a radio and rode in with an infantry company to rescue their comrades. ""Troop A skillfully penetrated four kilometers of nearly impassable jungle terrain and unhesitatingly mounted a fierce assault directly into the heavily fortified North Vietnamese army position,"" the presidential proclamation states. When the battle was over, more than 70 Americans lay dead or wounded. For retired Capt. John Poindexter, who led the rescue, the award is for all Vietnam veterans, many of whom came home to an unwelcome and sometimes hostile reception. ""The veterans of Alpha Troop feel very strongly that we stand in the stead of all veterans of the war of Vietnam,"" Poindexter told CNN before the ceremony. ""The fact is that we're being singled out for a very distinct honor, a very rare one, but it is our conviction that on any day in any other jungle in Vietnam, nearly every Vietnam veteran would have been willing to assume the task that we assumed on March 26, 1970, when we earned the Presidential Unit Citation."" Poindexter had been trying to gain recognition for his men for the past seven years. Initially, he felt deep disappointment. In 2003, he discovered that the men he had recommended for decorations for their valor had not received those citations. Eventually, 14 men received individual decorations. That was not enough. ""My role in obtaining the PUC [Presidential Unit Citation] -- or in helping to obtain the PUC -- among the 200 persons who were involved in this matter over a seven-year period, was to be in the unhappy position of discovering that the men who I had recommended for decorations had not been recommended, had not been awarded those decorations,"" the retired captain said. ""The result of that was that we got 14 men decorated for their valor, but 14 men out of more than 120 who were engaged in the battle on that fateful day were only a pittance, only a minority, of those who might have been honored. Only a unit citation could honor all equally and impartially, and it was that task we set ourselves on nearly seven years ago. "" He believes lack of popular support for the war had much to do with it taking so long for Alpha Troop to be recognized. ""There's little question in our minds that the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam is a major contributing factor to the reception these men received when they returned to the United States and a major factor, in my opinion, in the silence that most of them have assumed since then,"" Poindexter said. ""Why talk about something that most people don't have a very high opinion of in all likelihood? And if that isn't true, nevertheless, it's what most of these men think. They were engaged in an unpopular venture that has bedeviled them for much of their adult lives."" Now, the circle has been closed. ""It's a very elevating experience to see the men that I have not seen for 40 years since War Zone C in Vietnam,"" the former captain said. ""These are persons who have had success in life, and some have not had a lot of success in life, and to see how they've turned out, how they look these days, and to know I'll be with them in the White House [Tuesday] is a very fulfilling sensation for me. ""For me, the sensation of being honored is one of having closed an important chapter on my life in a very fruitful and rewarding way."" The Presidential Unit Citation is awarded to armed forces units of the United States and allies for extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy on or after December 7, 1941. The unit must display such gallantry, determination and esprit de corps under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign.",3,5.521853439532852

It may not have been fast, it may not have been smooth but it was still a landmark moment for the Olympic downhill champion. The American skiing star had finished her first race since making a complicated recovery from a knee injury. Vonn needed reconstructive surgery on her right knee after landing heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria in February. She has waited 10 months to go racing again and in November her return was put on ice when she partially tore one of her reconstructed knee ligaments in training. There were no complications for Vonn on her first competitive return down Canada's Lake Louise course -- but her time did not trouble the leaders. She finished her run in one minute 59.22 seconds -- more than three seconds off the leading time and 40th overall. The start of the race had been delayed by hazy cloud and extremely cold temperatures which dropped as low as -36 Celsius. Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch eventually came out on top with the quickest time. Vonn is racing against time to find form and fitness as she attempts to defend her downhill crown at February's Winter Olympics in the Russian resort of Sochi. There she will aim to emulate the feat of fellow American, Picabo Street, who came back the season after reconstructive surgery to win gold at Nagano in 1998. Vonn, who is dating golfer Tiger Woods, is a four-time overall World Cup champion and has won two world championship golds in a glittering career on the slopes.",8,9.745685875118427
382bdb89695bbfde14fdd6c6d66c88f1a62e3c07,CNN,"(CNN) -- In Al Qaem, Iraq, the anger and despair of the refugees is palpable. Two refugee camps have been set up there, nine miles from the border with Syria. As Save the Children's Country Director, I made the dangerous 280-mile journey out to Al Qaem to help with our distribution of urgently needed newborn kits and to hear the stories of the families. Although in numbers they are fewer than their counterparts in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, their suffering and needs are no less pronounced, especially given their low profile, the extreme challenges that organizations are facing in reaching them, the lack of funding and the minimal services in the area. Save the Children is one of very few organizations supporting the more than 8,000 Syrian refugees living in very difficult circumstances in this hardly accessible area in the far western corner of Iraq. I shiver despite the noon sun. Temperatures are no more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Thirteen-year-old Ali is stoic. ""You should be here at night to really feel it."" He beams a smile at me. I force myself to ignore the icy air. The thick baby blanket that we included in the newborn kits will come in very handy. I'm struck by the tidiness of Um Ahmed's tent. There are no possessions; just five sponge mattresses where 14 people sleep. As I sit cross-legged, the cold bites; I retreat to a kneeling position while the girls giggle shyly. These girls are attending the child-friendly space that we have helped set up for kids here. These children have been exposed to much pain, uncertainty, fear, displacement -- they really need the stability and normalcy that child-friendly spaces can offer. The stories come fast and furious. ""What have we done to deserve this? Look at our children just in T-shirts. No one has proper shoes, not even socks. My daughter-in-law had to flee for her life with seven children ... her husband is still there. He's my son; I don't know where or how he is."" Um Ahmed's daughters and their friends fill the tent with their stories -- of children's dirty clothes, of not showering in more than four weeks, of water too muddy to even make tea. The baby is crying. Her cheeks are swollen and yellowish as are those of many of the older children. ""Al Sfar"" (jaundice), confirms Um Ahmed. She says the clinic offers no help. One mother hugs her 3-year-old daughter. ""I'm just watching my child get sicker every day and there is nothing I can do."" Another woman, Intisar, wordlessly pulls the base of the tent out to show me how damp the gravel is under the tent. ""It seeps into those sponge mattresses, into our bones, into our skin. There is no way of staying warm or dry."" Her husband shows me the deep crevice dug by their resident rats. ""All night they crawl under us, trying to get warmth. The children scream, and I spend all night beating the rats out."" As I walk out, the tears rise in me. It hurts to look into the despair on the children's faces, to see a toddler barefoot on the gravel. There is so much that needs to be done. Without support these children truly suffer. As winter tightens its grip on Syria's neighboring countries, stories like those I heard in Al Qaem are far from unique. UNHCR estimates that the number of refugee children in the region has surpassed 250,000, and that number continues to climb. They lack medical care, adequate food, warmth and clean water. In Al Qaem, Save the Children has already provided hygiene kits for all families, 430 newborn kits and is helping 520 children through the child-friendly spaces. Regionally, Save the Children has reached 80,000 children and families so far and is working to triple our response in Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. As with all other organizations responding to the humanitarian needs of the Syrian refugees in the region, our greatest challenge is funding. We are on the ground. We have established operations in Al Qaem, which is no small feat. We are ready to deliver aid immediately but we need the funds to make it happen. That night, I cannot get warm, despite the blankets and thick walls. I cannot stop thinking of the children, out in the desert cold.

0f2e6f3fdfd7aac0b4676de4ad9df2cbbbad8f03,CNN,"(CNN) -- The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water. The aid requested is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake this year -- but twice as many Pakistanis are in dire need of help. The money poured in for survivors of Haiti's quake, but the funds are only slowly trickling in for people left homeless or ill in the wake of widespread flooding in the South Asian nation. Is it because the earthquake was such a sudden shock, destroying huge chunks of cities and villages within a matter of 35 horrifying seconds while Pakistan's floods evolved over three weeks? That's part of the reason, said Alex Wynter of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people,"" Wynter said. ""However, this is a totally exceptional flood. I have seen quite a number of floods in my time, but never anything remotely approaching this scale."" Much also depends on media coverage and the images that permeate television and computer screens. In Haiti, pictures of the collapsed presidential palace and vast tent cities tugged at hearts. ""It's very hard to compare disasters,"" said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). ""Haiti was instant, extremely visual. There was an outpouring of sympathy. Pakistan has been a slowly evolving disaster."" Though it is far from truth, the suffering in Pakistan appears more muted than when dump trucks carried thousands of crushed bodies to mass graves outside the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake. The flooding in Pakistan has been of epic proportions: 20 million people affected; more than 1,400 dead; 900,000 homes damaged; 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases. More people have been affected than in the 2004 South Asia tsunami, the 2005 South Asia earthquake, and the Haiti earthquake combined. But the enormous scale of Pakistan's tragedy has been hard to grasp. The death toll has not been nearly as high as it was in those previous disasters. Ironically, that may be a reason why aid has been slow to come in. ""The public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower, so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it,"" said Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for OCHA in Pakistan. ""The slow onset of the emergency meant that nobody knew the real scale at the beginning. It is a picture which is still evolving,"" he said. The United Nations asked for $460 million to cover six million Pakistanis over the next three months, but has only raised one-third of that so far. In Haiti, the United Nations received $286 million in just three days. Its request for $1.2 billion for three million Haitians over a six-month period was fulfilled within a couple of weeks, Reader said. Farzana Shaikh, an expert on Pakistan for the London-based Chatham House think-tank, blamed the country's reputation on the international stage for the low donor turnout. Many people associate Pakistan with Islamic militancy. ""Pakistan is seen to have done the international community the disservice of aiding and abetting terrorism, and this perception has almost certainly influenced people's willingness to dig deep into their pockets,"" Shaikh said. There are also perceptions that Pakistan is mired in corruption and that money donated in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake disappeared into a black hole. ""Unless Pakistan can show that it can be transparent, the international community will be wary of pumping in the kind of money that it needs at the moment,"" Shaikh said. ""In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."" Donors like to give money to problems they feel they can help solve. They like to make a difference, said Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton University who has studied the subject. ""There's lots of evidence that shows people are less likely to help if they feel it's a really big problem and they can't make a difference,"" said Singer, author of ""The Life You Can Save."" ""When you hear the extent of the problem in Pakistan, I think there is a sense of futility."" Haiti was smaller -- and closer to America.

Jason Mraz isn't just a singer and songwriter -- he's also a proud avocado farmer. When the San Diego singer-songwriter was in Los Angeles promoting his new album, ""We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things,"" he couldn't hide his excitement about his five-acre orchard. ""I do sell my avocados,"" he told CNN. ""I mean, they don't have a sticker on them that say that these are from the Mraz Farms, but I moved into an area that all of us are avocado farmers. My trees are 25-30 years old and, two or three times a year, [workers] come through and they pick 'em all. Believe me, our kitchen is just like decked out with them. We're constantly washing them, we're eating them and we're giving them to all our friends."" Mraz says he makes a great guacamole. But he's even prouder of his ""Chocomole"" -- a healthy chocolate mousse made with avocados.  Watch why Mraz is happy if you steal his music » . He says the creamy texture of the avocados will trick your tastebuds into thinking it's a traditional dessert. ""You will freak when you try this chocolate mousse. There's no sugar in it, there's no soy products in it, there's no tofu. You're just eating a raw chocolate mousse,"" he said. All around the world, vegans are salivating. Here's the recipe -- straight from the secret recipe file in Jason's avocado-shaped noggin. Mraz's Chocomole Recipe: . Note: This will make a huge bowl big enough for a family of four. You'll want to share this with friends. Mash up 5 ripened avocados . Add 1 - 2 cups of chopped or blended dates . 1 soft cup of raw cacao . 1 easy cup of raw carob powder . 1 tbsp. vanilla . Add a few long pours of agave nectar to sweeten to liking . Then add half cups of cocoa and keep adding until chocolate taste is right. Careful not to overdo it -- if you add too much, it can get bitter. You will love. Enjoy, Jason .",7,7.7312939722410565
856d25f18d96d067d2f5c0fa72434032baa13dc9,CNN,"(CNN) -- If you thought dirty money was only found in offshore bank accounts, check your wallet instead. But you may want to wash your hands afterward. Almost 60% of Europeans believe cash is the dirtiest item they come into contact with, ahead of escalator handrails, buttons on payment terminals and library books, according to a survey of 1,000 people released on March 25 by Mastercard. A further 83% of the respondents, taken from 15 countries across Europe, believe cash carries a lot of bacteria. And they are right. Independent tests on European money conducted by a team of scientists at Oxford University in December 2012, revealed that the average banknote contains 26,000 bacteria, enough germs to make you feel nauseous, and possibly even spread disease. ""Europeans' perceptions of dirty cash are not without reason,"" Ian Thompson, the professor from Oxford University who tested the cash, said in a news release. ""The bank notes we tested harbored an average of 26,000 bacteria, which, for a number of pathogenic organisms, is sufficient for passing on infection."" Even the newest, and therefore cleanest, notes tested contained 2,400 bacteria, with Swiss Francs and Danish Krone the dirtiest money of all. ""(The bacteria) comes from multiple hands,"" Hany Fam from Mastercard told CNN's Richard Quest. ""These notes have a long time in circulation, they're handed, hand to hand, from different individuals and it's inevitable that germs accumulate on them."" Clearly, a credit card company like MasterCard has its own economic interests in pushing people away from cash. ""No, I'm not just advocating credit cards: I'm just saying that consumers are increasingly flocking to other forms of payment -- not only for cleanliness, obviously, but for ease, for convenience, for lots of reasons,"" Mastercard's Fam said. Still, cash is dirty. A 2002 study published in the Southern Medical Journal also found bacteria-laden banknotes. Over 80% of cash tested carried germs that could be harmful to people with lowered immunity. Seven percent of bills showed traces of bacteria that can cause serious illness, including Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia, according to the study. Only 7% of the bills were germ-free. Another study conducted in 2008 at Switzerland's University Hospitals of Geneva found that some flu virus cells could last for up to 17 days on Swiss banknotes, according to SmartMoney.com . So what to do? To prevent infection, scientists suggest basic hygiene: Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth, and wash your hands often. But that won't necessarily prevent illicit banknote contamination. Last year three employees at a Michigan Circle K store became ill after handling money that had been contaminated with methamphetamine residue, according to a local news website, Ann Arbor.com. Cocaine is also a common contaminate in the U.S. A 2009 study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth found up to 90% of paper money circulating in America contained traces of cocaine.",7,14.244053100215709
6ffc52e56343bfe00af799a6b4cb6ee8c7c8e6ca,CNN,"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police raided an Islamic school and arrested seven students hours after a blast in a mosque in northern Pakistan left at least 50 dead and dozens injured, according to an Associated Press report. A man, right, mourns the death of his two sons in a suicide attack near Peshawar that killed at least 50. A bomb, packed with ball-bearings and nails, tore through Eid prayers at a mosque packed with hundreds of worshippers northeast of Peshawar on Friday, targeting Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, former Pakistani interior minister, local police told CNN. The blast left blood-stained clothes, hats and shoes as well as body parts and pieces of flesh scattered across the mosque, according to reports. The attack is the most recent in a series of attacks in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and occurred near Sherpao's residence in Charsadda -- an area approximately 28 miles (45 kilometers) northeast of the city of Peshawar.  Watch what's known about the blast » . Police investigators say Taliban or al Qaeda elements could have been involved and they believe the former minister was targeted over his supervision of operations against militants in Pakistan's tribal areas including the restive NWFP. This attack is the deadliest in Pakistan since 136 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi on October 18 in a suicide bombing targeting the convoy of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister.  See photos from the blast's aftermath » . Bhutto returned to the country after eight years in self-imposed exile ahead of January parliamentary elections. The attack comes in the midst of continued operations by the Pakistani army to rout out militants in the swat valley in the north of the country, an area the government considers a front-line in the so-called global war on terror. A former tourist destination about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Islamabad, The Swat Valley has been plagued by violence and has become a hotbed for militants. Earlier this month, the army said it has retaken towns seized by militants over the summer, killing 290 and capturing 140. The attack also comes less than a week after President Pervez Musharraf lifted a six-week-old state of emergency he said was necessary to ensure the country's stability but that critics said was a move to stifle the country's judiciary, curb the media and secure more power. While Musharraf has promised free and fair parliamentary elections, continued instability in the tribal areas and the threat of attack on large crowds has kept people from attending political rallies and dampened the country's political process. Campaigners from various political parties say fewer people are coming out to show their support. The president -- who survived two assassination attempts in December 2003 -- denounced Friday's attack, speaking out against what he said was a small number of Muslim extremists who would carry out such an act, according to a report from the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan. He ordered security and intelligence agencies to find those responsible. A spokesperson for the U.N. said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemns the attack and he ""urges all political forces in Pakistan to unite against the scourge of terrorism and to act together to create a peaceful environment ahead of the Parliamentary elections."" This is the second attempt on Sherpao's life since April, when a suicide bomber blew himself up just a few feet from Sherpao during a political rally, injuring him and killing at least 28 people. The APP reported that the blast was caused by a suicide bomber inside the mosque, as people were gathering for religious observances of Eid al-Adha, the Muslim celebration of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. ""We were saying prayers when this huge explosion occurred,"" said Shaukat Ali, a 26-year-old survivor of the blast whose white cloak and pants were torn and spattered with blood, an AP report said. Despite security measures at the mosque, the bomber was praying in a row of worshippers when he detonated the explosive, provincial police chief Sharif Virk said, the report added. A Peshawar hospital was wracked with chaos as the injured arrived in pickup trucks, ambulance sirens wailed and the wounded screamed for help, the report said. The bomb contained between 13-17 pounds of explosives and was filled with nails and ball bearings to maximize casualties, said the head of the bomb unit at the scene, who declined to give his name. Sherpao and his two sons were in the first row of the mosque, the APP report said. Mustafa Khan Sherpao had leg injuries while Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao ""escaped unhurt."" Sherpao was Pakistan's interior minister -- the country's top civilian security official -- before Musharraf announced a caretaker government in November ahead of elections. He heads the breakaway political group Pakistan People's Party-Sherpao, is a vocal critic of religious extremism, pro-Musharraf and a candidate in upcoming elections. E-mail to a friend .

19bf7cc73fdb69fcc8079e4c9704fc6230aa8039,CNN,"(CNN) -- As a child, I thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the Philippines was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until I mingled with people from different social classes. The feeling of being unwanted tore my heart out, and I grew to feel so sorry for myself. I was looked down upon and discriminated against because of my appearance in cheap secondhand clothes and old shoes. I wore the same pair of shoes for more than 10 years, lining the sole with a plastic bag so the water wouldn't seep into my feet. Because of the way I looked, I was often bullied by gang members verbally and at times physically, with others hitting and shoving me. I felt different, powerless and socially isolated. Watch a preview of the 2010 CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute . I was then focused on one thing: revenge! I kept those feelings to myself and it consumed me little by little, until my heart grew cold and I wanted to give up everything. I almost quit school because I was afraid. I thought of joining a gang to strike back at the bullies. I was lost, troubled and crying my heart out but nobody heard, no one seemed to care. I got so lost that I couldn't even find my way back to peace and happiness until God answered the desire of my heart. I was 13 when I met a man who became my friend, mentor, teacher and somewhat like a father. He helped me pick up the broken pieces of my life, which eventually healed my broken spirit. That mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things. He taught me that the quality of life is more dependent on our perspective than our circumstances, that the value of being is more dependent on our character than on our achievements -- and that the worth of our existence is more dependent on how we live life than on how long we survive. My mentor taught me that if I struck back with revenge against those who harmed and threatened me, it would just worsen my situation. So he introduced me to several volunteer activities, from distributing sandwiches to prisoners to building houses for less fortunate families to working in youth empowerment programs. I felt good about what I did, especially when people appreciated those small efforts. During those moments, I discovered my responsibility to other people and I slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against. My mentor encouraged me to think of a positive way to get back at those who bullied and put me down, not by violence but by competition. At 16, he helped me and my friends create Dynamic Teen Company as an alternative club for students on campus and in communities, a way to stop bullies and school gangsters from victimizing and terrorizing more students. Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities. Our goal was to show that that there is strength in numbers and that goodness should triumph over wrongdoing. Our crusade against the acts of bullies and gang groups has reached the slums and depressed areas in our town, where many kids are groomed and trained as early as 9 years old to become a gangster. We were able to save children from this fate and help them become an asset to build a better community. We put an emphasis on using education and faith to help every child to have a better and decent life. This has become our mission. There are plenty of kids all over the world who are going through the same things as I did. And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence. The role of adults, parents and mentors makes a big difference in combating this issue. Children must be loved, protected and given proper guidance. Good old family values should be strengthened. Education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well. Love for learning will open new doors of opportunities to everyone. We should remember that all adults are in some ways teachers to children who watch us and copy our beliefs, acts and lifestyle. We want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving, accepting and respecting of others, so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society.

b9d9ada74ab01028e7cbe0986eb1c3cd7e8607b6,CNN,"(CNN)Ashley McIntyre had no idea who Danny Robinson was when she heard he was searching for a kidney. He was the same age as her and had already been through so much. Diagnosed at age 16 with IgA nephropathy, an inflammatory kidney disease, Danny had been in kidney failure since 2012, the same year he lost his father to brain cancer. The Louisville, Kentucky, electrician was working full time and undergoing four-hour stints of dialysis three nights a week to stay alive while he waited for a transplant. On January 16, 2014, Ashley overheard her mother telling her grandmother about Danny. The young man and his mother had just been on a Louisville radio talk show sharing their story. None of his family members had been eligible to donate their kidneys, and the anonymous donors who volunteered weren't compatible. Ashley immediately felt compassion for this soft-spoken stranger. The next day was her 25th birthday. She got a hold of Danny's mom through the radio host and said she couldn't think of anything she'd rather do for her birthday than give someone the gift of life. Woman to become living donor for a man she had never met . Before she had heard Danny's story, she was always signed up to donate her organs after her death, but she had never considered being a living organ donor. Danny had Type O blood, meaning he could only be matched with a Type O donor. She knew she had the right blood type. She would need to undergo a series of other blood tests, physical and psychological exams to see if she was eligible to give Danny a kidney. Ashley and Danny were deemed a perfect match for the transplant. What are the odds that they would fall in love? ""Never in a million years did I think it would be a perfect match all the way around and end up like this,"" Ashley said. Danny's mom, Denise Stutzenberger, says even before she met Ashley, she was convinced her son would end up marrying her. ""I told her, 'You are going to be my daughter-in-law, you just don't know it yet,' "" she said. ""I don't know how to explain it. Something in me told me."" More than 100,000 Americans need a kidney, and fewer than 17,000 people receive one each year, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Less than 6,000 of those come from living donors -- and fewer than 200 living donors are like Ashley, with no connection or relation to the person in need. Ashley didn't want to meet Danny or his family until she found out it was a go. ""She was so scared that she was going to let us down. All I wanted to do was hug her. She was our angel,"" Danny's mom said. The two families grew close in the months leading up to the transplant on April 17 at the University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington. The night before their surgeries, Danny gave Ashley a musical jewelry box inscribed with the words, ""Ashley, you're an angel ... Danny."" It played ""I'll Be There"" by the Jackson Five. Memorial Day weekend, with the transplant behind them, the couple sensed they had a deeper connection but proceeded cautiously. ""We both agreed we did not want to mess up the relationship between us or our families, because by that time we were connected for life,"" she said. On June 5, Danny asked Ashley to be his girlfriend. They've been inseparable ever since and are expecting a girl, Berkli, in June. Danny proposed on Christmas. Ashley does most of the talking; she's the one who gives you a sense of their love. Danny isn't really one to talk about his feelings. ""I guess you can say we just fell in love,"" he said. ""I told her I wanted to be with her forever."" Danny will take anti-rejection medication for the rest of his life, but he said he's healthy now. Ashley's kidney won't last forever, however. Whenever it fails, in an estimated 20 to 30 years, ""I will be doing whatever I can to help him get a new one,"" she said. ""I wish I had 50 kidneys to give him."" Ashley says it's been a whirlwind romance. ""I feel like my feet haven't touched the ground,"" she said. ""It's just been an incredible, unexpected, serendipitous journey.""",8,6.710261215856864
f195939a4b9874a7ca59775a3009f55e12de8d25,CNN,"(CNN)The list of canceled Bill Cosby shows has grown this month. Four shows the comedian had scheduled for February have been canceled: February 8 in Boston, February 21 in Pittsburgh and February 22 in Charlotte, North Carolina. No reasons were given for the Pittsburgh and Charlotte cancellations. Cosby said weather concerns led to the Boston cancellation, but the date has not been rescheduled. A fourth show, scheduled for Thalia Mara Hall in Jackson, Mississippi, on Thursday, has been ""postponed,"" Shelia Byrd of the Jackson Mayor's Office told CNN. Gary Bongiovanni, editor-in-chief of Pollstar -- the concert tour publication -- says it's been challenging to keep track. ""It seems like they're falling like dominoes, one at a time,"" he said. ""The whole thing has gotten a lot shorter than it was."" The concert cancellations are the latest complications for Cosby, who has been the subject of numerous sexual abuse allegations. The current tour, which began last fall, has felt reverberations from the allegations. Twenty-four women have spoken with CNN, have asserted their allegations on camera or in published accounts, or have been the subject of responses from Cosby's attorneys. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Cosby's accusers' allegations. While his attorneys denied the initial accusations, they haven't responded to more recent allegations, including the two newest ones in February. No charges have been filed against Cosby. Nevertheless, some venues have canceled Cosby's shows, including halls in Houston; Las Vegas; Tucson, Arizona; Yakima, Washington; Tarrytown, New York; and Durant, Oklahoma. Reasons have been terse: The Las Vegas show was canceled ""by mutual agreement,"" a representative said at the time, and Tarrytown said it had canceled two shows in consultation with the shows' promoter, according to a note from the venue. ""It's a dance that the promoter does with the venue and with Cosby himself,"" Bongiovanni said of the considerations that go into cancellation decisions. There might be contractual obligations, deposits and even -- given the demonstrators who have shown up at some venues -- concerns about public safety, he says. Cosby's Denver show draws protests . For example, at Cosby's London, Ontario, show, about 100 people came to protest the comedian. ""Why would you want to pay to see a rapist?"" demonstrator Milena LeDuc asked. Cosby was also heckled at two Canadian shows. However, though not selling out the halls, Cosby has received plenty of support as well. The London venue was about half-full, but the audience was said to be generally appreciative. ""I don't believe he's been charged with anything, and at least in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty,"" Bruce Maslen said, adding that the protesters and hecklers didn't spoil a thing. At his November show in Melbourne, Florida, Cosby received a standing ovation. Bongiovanni observes that, despite the bad publicity, Cosby's tour has been fairly successful. For the calendar year of 2014 -- which includes several months before the accusations went viral -- Pollstar's numbers show that Cosby's tour had $10.8 million in ticket sales over 101 shows. His ticket sales averaged about 2,200 per venue at about $57 each. In other words, not bad. ""His shows were selling OK. He's making great money at that sale level,"" Bongiovanni said. Cosby's website, billcosby.com, no longer lists tour stops, though a list can be found elsewhere on the Internet (including on Pollstar's website). The next scheduled concert is February 27 at Lafayette, Louisiana's, Heymann Performing Arts Center. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this story.",1,10.522353923293585
6bfef05f9497ce8be812b95c29bbdd2c640ee577,CNN,"(CNN) -- The president of the South African Football Association (SAFA) has been suspended as part of an investigation into match-fixing ahead of the country hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010. Kirsten Nematandani and four other SAFA officials were suspended as an act of ""good governence"" following a report by football's global governing body FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup had been fixed. According to the FIFA report, the results of South Africa's matches with Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala were prearranged for the benefit of convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organization. Nematandani declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Last year, Perumal was imprisoned in Finland after a court ruled that he had arranged the outcomes of at least seven league matches from 2008 onwards. The Singaporean was also heavily implicated in the match-fixing scandal that affected South Africa's neighbors Zimbabwe between 2007-2009, a process which has had repercussions for nearly 100 footballers while two former national coaches have been banned. The timing of FIFA's report into match-fixing involving the team known as Bafana Bafana comes at a bad time for South Africa, as it is just one month away from hosting the continent's showpiece football event -- the Africa Cup of Nations. The suspensions were announced by a SAFA emergency committee on Monday, ahead of an enquiry, with vice president Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana set to take interim charge of the governing body. ""The emergency committee considered and accepted the report as received,"" read an SAFA statement. ""The emergency committee felt that the president would have to appear before the commission of enquiry to explain his role in the matter. ""Having considered the implications of this for SAFA, the committee asked the president to take a voluntary leave of absence from his position. ""All members of staff mentioned in the report who will need to give evidence at the commission are likewise put on special administrative leave pending the finalization of the enquiry, or pending receiving a clearance from the commission. ""This action in no way implies that these individuals were involved in match fixing. It is again simply for good governance that this measure is being implemented. ""The members of staff so affected are: Dennis Mumble, Lindile 'Ace' Kika, Adeel Carelse and Barney Kujane."" The SAFA was unavailable to clarify what the FIFA report might mean for South African football or what action they may take after the inquiry. The organization said last week it wanted to ""bring this unfortunate matter to a just and final conclusion."" Speaking as president -- before his suspension -- Nematandani said: ""Having cooperated with FIFA during their investigation, we are happy that this matter is coming to its conclusion and our commitment to zero tolerance to corruption is well documented. ""SAFA remains totally committed to working with FIFA to wipe out the scourge of corruption that is impacting on football globally."" Mumble is SAFA's new chief executive officer. Interim president Nonkonyama stressed how all parties involved should be considered innocent until proven guilty. ""This is a difficult situation for the Association, and for those who have been named in the report. We hope that there will be no speculation about their presumed guilt or otherwise. ""We need to allow the investigation to take place speedily and fairly, so those that are innocent can be separated from those who are not."" In a statement released last week, South African football's ruling body acknowledged that ""Perumal and Football 4U managed to infiltrate SAFA prior to the World Cup, with an offer to assist with referee development. ""The offer included providing FIFA-accredited referees at their cost for the friendly matches prior to the FIFA 2010 World Cup."" One of these games -- when South Africa beat Guatemala 5-0 in May 2010 -- featured the award of three penalties. A month later the 2010 World Cup was the first to be staged on the continent of Africa. Hosts South Africa were eliminated in the group stages, but, to the delight of African football fans, Ghana enjoyed a run to the quarterfinal.

76c41b3b911a108da8485851187bacfa1356a1a7,CNN,"(CNN) -- It was a foggy winter's night on the remote Ballymany Stud Farm in Ireland when its head groom Jim Fitzgerald heard a knock at the door. What lurked outside was to spark one of the most extraordinary unsolved kidnappings of the 20th Century. Thirty years ago this week -- on February 8, 1983 -- Fitzgerald was confronted by three masked gunmen. They had come for Shergar -- then the most valuable race horse in the world and the pride of a nation. ""Shergar was the best race horse in the world, owned by the richest man in the world. It was the most sensational sports story of all time,"" racing commentator Derek Thompson told CNN. ""We were staggered. A horse kidnapped? Nothing like this had ever happened before."" The retired champion race horse, owned by billionaire businessman the Aga Khan, was worth a staggering £10 million ($16 million) -- around £28 million ($44 million) by today's standards. Were Shergar here today, he would be the ninth-most valuable athlete in the world, just ahead of Real Madrid's prized footballer Cristiano Ronaldo on $42.5 million. The five-year-old breeding stallion, who had mated with 35 mares in his first season, was set to be worth millions in the coming years with owners paying up to £80,000 ($126,000) for his highly sought-after offspring. This, after all, was the champion colt who two years earlier annihilated the field at Britain's prestigious Epsom Derby, winning by 10 lengths -- the biggest margin in the race's 226-year history. For racing-mad Ireland, Shergar was the darling of a nation in turmoil during the darkest days of ""the Troubles,"" with violence between nationalists and unionists in the north as they vied for political power. The bandits demanded £2 million ($3 million) for Shergar and conspiracy theories abounded, with the New Orleans Mafia and the Libya's Colonel Gaddafi linked to the thoroughbred's kidnapping. But the most popular accused culprit remains the Irish Republican Army (IRA), whom the Aga Khan and his syndicate of owners officially blamed for the kidnap, though authorities have never named a suspect. While the IRA, which has disbanded, took responsibility for a number of attacks over the years, it never claimed to have kidnapped Shergar. Back at Ballymany on that fateful night, the stallion with a distinctive white blaze on his face and four white ""socks"" was loaded into a horse box never to be seen again. Father-of-six Fitzgerald was bundled into a car and driven around for hours before being dumped a few miles from home. He was warned not to call the police. Then a series of mismanaged calls ensured almost eight hours elapsed before police were alerted. Hampering their investigation was the clever timing of the kidnapping -- it was the day before Ireland's major Goff's racehorse sale and roads were filled with horse boxes identical to Shergar's. The kidnappers demanded negotiations through three horse racing journalists at the time -- John Oaksey, Peter Campling, and then 32-year-old television presenter Thompson. ""We were taken to the Europa Hotel, whose claim to fame was that it was the most bombed hotel in Europe,"" Thompson said. ""Don't forget, this was 1983 at the height of the 'Troubles' and Belfast was one of the most dangerous cities in the world."" At the hotel, which still had cracked windows from a previous bombing, Thompson got a call from the kidnappers telling him he was being watched from across the road. He was told to go to a deserted farmhouse 30 miles away for negotiations. There, Thompson said he received eight phone calls from the kidnappers over eight hours. Each call lasted around 60 seconds, but the police needed at least 90 seconds to trace the call. ""When the last call came at 1.30 a.m. I managed to keep him talking for one minute and 35 seconds,"" Thompson said. ""I thought, 'That's it, we've got him,' but the police told me 'Sorry Mr. Thompson, the man who does the tracing goes off duty at midnight.' ""That was the best chance we had of catching them and it was gone."" Shergar was owned by a syndicate of 34 people, each with a share worth £250,000 ($394,000). The syndicate refused to pay the ransom, fearing it would encourage other kidnappings. ""The following Monday we received a call saying the horse had had an accident and was dead. That was the last time we heard from them,"" Thompson said. Thompson believes the IRA was responsible, pointing to evidence in former member Sean O'Callaghan's 1999 autobiography ""The Informer."" ""Every time I took a call from the kidnapper I used a different code word -- the name of a famous race horse -- so I would know it was the same guy calling back,"" Thompson said. ""But there was always one name I kept to myself, I never told anyone else, and when I read O'Callaghan's book it was there. That really shook me to the core."" Jockey Walter Swinburn, who as a 19-year-old rode Shergar to that historic Epsom Derby win, said the kidnapping had a profound effect on tightening racing industry security. ""Shergar's stable was very impressive but anybody could have walked into it,"" he said. ""Today it's more like a padded cell, they can't afford for the horse to get injured, with CCTV and a large number of grooms."" The thoroughbred has since been immortalized in Ascot's annual Shergar Cup and the 1999 film ""Shergar"" starring Mickey Rourke. Swinburn regrets that Shergar's achievements on the track will always be overshadowed by his dramatic abduction. But the image of him pounding over the hill at Epsom, his seemingly tiny competitors trailing behind, lives on.",1,8.118192375967189
92b018f992ee3b805bfc37dd63ada97ea07c2a59,CNN,"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has nominated former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel as his next defense secretary and anti-terrorism chief John Brennan as CIA director. Hagel's nomination could be the most contentious of those Obama is making because of positions the former lawmaker took on Israel and Iran and his opposition to the troop surges in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's John Berman on Tuesday spoke to Newsweek and Daily Beast special correspondent Peter Beinart about ""Why Hagel Matters,"" the piece he wrote on Hagel's nomination: . CNN: Peter wrote what I think is (one of the) most ... interesting and compelling articles about the Hagel nomination, explaining it perhaps better than anyone I've seen, including the president. The first paragraph of the piece, you write, it may prove the most consequential foreign policy appointment of his presidency because the struggle over Hagel is a struggle over whether Obama can change the terms of the foreign policy debate. Explain that for me. Peter Beinart: I think so far, the debate about military action in Iran has been conducted by and large in Washington, as if Iraq and Afghanistan didn't happen. As if we haven't learned anything from the disaster (of) these two wars over the last 10 years. I think the real struggle between Hagel and his foes is he wants to bring some of the lessons in to the Iran debate that we learned about (Iraq) and Afghanistan. He talks very compellingly about the fact wars once launched can't be fully controlled. He is very cognizant of the enormous financial cost that these wars have imposed on the United States, and I think the heart of the hostility is the fear that his recognition about what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq will make taking us to war in Iran harder. Hagel vows to fight 'distortions' CNN: You suggest there are no consequences for the Iraq War in terms of those who supported or imposed it. Beinart: What I said if you listen to Republican foreign policy discourse, with the exception of a few people like Chuck Hagel, you would think the Iraq War had been a great success. Because all of the same people who said it was a great success are defining in large measure the debate over war on Iran, pushing the United States closer, and I think Hagel is a (messenger for) ... the president to say, ""Hold on a second here. ""I am going to set the bar for war higher than George W. Bush, and I don't think this is a simple and easy thing."" CNN: Why does Obama need that? Obama opposed the war in Iraq for longer than Chuck Hagel. Hagel voted for the invasion. Beinart: Yes, that's right. Chuck Hagel did. But ... (he was) one of the few Republican senators who, after the war started, he began to rethink his view of the world. It's not only about Iran. I think the other big thing about the Hagel nomination is that Obama wants someone to bring the Defense Department back into balance with America's financial resources. CNN: Is this a smaller foreign policy? A smaller defense policy? Beinart: I think it is. The dominant Republican way to talk about the defense budget is to completely separate it, wall it off from all considerations about the national debt. Chuck Hagel doesn't see it that way. He's a lot like Dwight Eisenhower, who people forget drove the defense budget down quite dramatically because he believed America's real power was its fiscal health, its economic health. White House officials reach out to Jewish community to answer Hagel concerns . CNN: A lot of fire around Hagel's nomination has to do with Israel and Hagel's support and the lack of support as the case may be for Israel. (Here's) ... what Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said about Hagel, ""Comments he's made about the so-called Jewish lobby, which seems to denigrate the efforts of pro-Israel individuals, myself included, who view that relationship as a special relationship, one that's important to our national security and stability in the region."" Hagel suggests he misspoke or shouldn't have used those words. But is this a real problem for him? Beinart: No, I think this is really a smoke screen. If Chuck Hagel had the same views on Iran and defense spending as John McCain, no one would even be talking about these comments. I think it's really a sideshow. One of the most important Jewish leaders, Malcolm Hoenlein, used the same phrase -- ""Jewish lobby"" -- just last December. Yes, it would be more accurate to call it, I think, the kind of right-wing, pro-Israel lobby. But the truth is many of the people in the pro-Israel lobby are, in fact, Jewish, as is myself. One of the groups is the American Jewish Committee. So to suggest this is in any way anti-Semitic, when many, many Jews, including a rabbi from Omaha, has testified to (Hagel's) good relationship with (the) Jewish community I think is character assassination, to be honest. Opinion: GOP, don't fight Hagel nomination .",1,9.225820220490014
22c59aa40144188e38bacfc49204142851b231e4,CNN,"(CNN) -- Ralph McQuarrie, the man credited with bringing director George Lucas' vision for ""Star Wars"" to the big screen, has died at the age of 82. McQuarrie's conceptual designs were the basis for some of the trilogy's iconic characters such as Darth Vader, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO. A statement on McQuarrie's official website, posted after his death Saturday, said his influence on design will be felt forever. ""There's no doubt in our hearts that centuries from now amazing spaceships will soar, future cities will rise and someone, somewhere will say... that looks like something Ralph McQuarrie painted,"" it read. Lucas said he was saddened by McQuarrie's passing, calling him a visionary artist and a humble man. ""Ralph McQuarrie was the first person I hired to help me envision Star Wars,"" Lucas said.

e1127c6446c0a5188df15e1e8d99d807cafcc3c0,CNN,"London (CNN) -- Tension in the stadium was at fever pitch, with the world record holder Jonnie Peacock gesturing for quiet from the partisan home crowd as two more star performers in the field settled into the blocks for what was billed as a grudge match. At stake was a London Paralympics 100m gold medal featuring rival runners who had been involved in a spat in an earlier race. But it was also the moment I realized for the first time that I was watching the contest not through the prism of disability but as a genuinely exciting sporting event that had me riveted to the edge of my seat. It was the first of two revelations of the night. As a sports fan and Brit I gobbled up hours of breathtaking competition from the London Olympics but I confess I had mixed views on the Paralympics before the event started. Great for the competitors, great for the home crowd who could be confident of a high medal count, great for the profile of disabled sport -- but would we really be watching a fair contest? For the most part, that reservation has been blown away by a week of heart-warming stories of courage and determination, and of blistering, thrilling athletics, cycling, swimming and a host of other sports I have not explored before. Take blind football for example. It is an astonishing mixture of traditional football and a ballet in fast-forward. Players sprint across the pitch, skilfully tapping the football from foot to foot, while defenders follow the game by sound, listening for the bell inside the ball. You can only wonder at their close control and spatial awareness. It's thrilling stuff and such was their mastery that if you didn't know better, you would swear the players could see. Then there's the passion and aggression of wheelchair rugby, or ""Murderball"" as it has been coined. It's fast, it's furious, and full-on. Never mind that they are in wheelchairs -- the hits are real. The same agility is evident in the wheelchair basketball where the athletes can turn their chairs on a dime. On Thursday night, Olympic and Paralympic sprint star Oscar Pistorius . -- ""Blade Runner"" as he is known -- was pipped for third place in that eagerly-anticipated 100m sprint by his South African team mate Arnu Fourie. Local boy Peacock duly delivered joy for the home crowd by winning gold, and American Richard Browne took silver. It was an explosive race that made a change to the medal table... and my second pause for reflection. Where on earth was the United States of America in all this? Given the size of the United Kingdom, we have no business occupying third slot in the Paralympic Games medal table. Browne ran well in the 100m but the U.S. languished in sixth place despite the team being the third largest represented at the Games. The CNN website has given prominent coverage to the London 2012 Paralympics but U.S. host broadcaster NBC decided to show only four hour-long highlight programs on its sport channel. It's a decision that has drawn criticism from former Paralympian and chef de mission of the U.S. Paralympic team, Aimee Mullins. ""That disconnect between the U.S. being a world leader in disability issues and the broadcast coverage in real time of the Games is disappointing,"" she said in the UK newspaper, The Guardian. The lack of coverage is a terrible shame because American citizens have missed out on the fantastic endeavours of their athletes and could potentially hold back the future aspirations of many more. U.S. athlete Tatyana McFadden has won a heap of Paralympic medals since 2004. But as her own website puts it: ""She probably should not be alive."" She was born with spina bifida, resulting in paralysis below the waist, and spent the first six years of her life using her hands as if they were feet because she didn't have a wheelchair. She was rescued from a Russian orphanage in 1994 by Debbie McFadden -- then Commissioner of Disabilities for the U.S. Tatyana has overcome abandonment, disability and illness to become a world beating athletic star. Eight-time world champion Mallory Weggemann represents the U.S. in the swimming pool and described to CNN the commitment needed to win Paralympic gold. It would be a tragedy if people like McFadden and Weggemann were denied a chance to shine on an international stage. The UK has been creating opportunities for disabled athletes since the end of World War II, and it shows on the medal table. But many nations were only able to send one or two athletes to London. I hope the interest and enthusiasm demonstrated by the sell-out crowds at London Paralympic events will be matched by other countries because the fun attached to inspiring, entertaining sport has been a welcome tonic to the economic gloom. There may still be questions over whether there is a level playing field in all sports in the Paralympics but the exposure and debate can only improve the way the events are organized. Perhaps the real inequality is in the sporting chance that nations give to those who wish to confront their disabilities, excel in sports they have made their own and compete in the kind of activities that the able-bodied take for granted. Perhaps too they deserve better media coverage at home. For my part, I just can't wait for the Rio Paralympic Games. I hope you get to watch them too.",7,8.304343876229677
844858f9870816092608e80488a69541906dba12,CNN,"(CNN) -- Think you have the landlord from hell? Think again. Did they steal your stuff? Lock you out? Threaten you with a gun? Unless they did, they're not even in contention for the title. Husband and wife, Kip and Nicole Macy, pleaded guilty to felony charges of residential burglary, stalking and attempted grand theft this week, after terrorizing tenants for years, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said Wednesday. ""The actions of these defendants are so outlandish and brazen that it sounds like the plot line of a horror movie,"" District Attorney George Gascon said. How bad did it get? Kip and Nicole Macy so badly wanted to evict tenants from their apartment building in the South of Market district starting in 2006, court documents say, that they cut holes in the floor of one victim's living room with a power saw while he was inside his apartment. ""He actually saw the saw coming up and trying to saw through,"" Assistant District Attorney Kelly Burke told CNN affiliate KTVU. The Macys also cut out sections of the floor joists. Before making the cuts, Nicole Macy took the time to consult with a city building inspector to make sure she knew which beam to cut to make the building structurally unsound. ""They want to make it collapse,"" Ricardo Cartagena, a former property manager for the Macys, told affiliate KGO. Kip Macy later bought a semiautomatic handgun and threatened to shoot Cartagena after he refused to cut the joists himself. The couple eventually changed the locks to Cartagena's apartment, removed all of his belongings and destroyed them, court records show. Not done yet . Nicole Macy also created a couple of fraudulent e-mails accounts to stir up trouble. In one, pretending to be one of the victims, she fired the attorney who was representing the victim in a civil case against the Macys. From another e-mail account, Macy sent a message to her and her husband's civil attorneys, threatening to kidnap and dismember their children. In the e-mail, she pretended to be one of victims. Still not done . Over the course of two years, the Macys cut the victims' telephone lines and shut off their electricity, gas and water, court documents say. Nicole Macy told workers to board up one victim's windows from the outside while he still lived there and falsely reported trespassers in the victim's apartment, causing him and a friend to be held at gunpoint by a police. They also broke into the units of three tenants, removing nearly all of their belongings. In a separate incident, the Macys soaked their beds, clothes and electronics with ammonia. Side trip to Italy . After being indicted by a grand jury in early 2009, the couple fled the country. More than three years later, Italian special agents apprehended them in May 2012 and returned them to the United States last month. They will be formally sentenced in August in a plea deal that will send them to prison for four years and four months. Cartagena said he was happy to hear that the couple would be going to prison.

1e0cfe9a9e5ec6176738e6d6bedca81b3aeaf2dd,CNN,"(CNN) -- Mercedes-Benz will head up their own Formula One team next season after the German car manufacturer confirmed they have taken a 75.1 percent share in Brawn GP -- with Ross Brawn remaining as team principal. Mercedes engines powered Brawn's Jenson Button to the world championship this season -- while the team also claimed the constructors' championship. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, Button's predecessor as world champion, was also sitting behind a Mercedes engine in his McLaren. The partnership between McLaren and Mercedes has been in place since 1995 and ended its 15th season together in 2009. The new team will become known as Mercedes Grand Prix, with Brawn in control, while Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug will work with the F1 team and the engine team of Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines. As part of the deal, Mercedes' parent company Daimler AG relinquished their 40 per cent stake in McLaren, but will remain their engine suppliers for the next six seasons. Daimler AG chief executive Dr. Dieter Zetsche explained in a press release: ""Mercedes-Benz is the most valued and best-known premium automotive brand in the world. ""This brand looks for competition of the utmost quality in all relevant fields in order to continually improve its performance in the face of such new challenges. ""Due to the new Formula One environment, we will face the competition in future on the most important motor sports stage with our own Silver Arrow works team. ""Our new Silver Arrow Formula One team is a great sporting and technical chal-lenge and we will tackle this with sporting spirit and full of enthusiasm."" The move could have ramifications for the out-of-contract Button, with Mercedes believed to favor an all-German partnership of Nico Rosberg and Nick Hiedfeld. Such a move could see Button link up with Hamilton at McLaren and the 29-year-old was believed to have toured McLaren's Woking factory last week. Brawn, who has previously baulked at meeting Button's wage demands, was thrilled with the deal after forming Brawn GP following the withdrawal of Honda from the sport. ""We are honored to be representing such a prestigious brand as Mercedes-Benz in Formula One next year and will be working together to do our best to reward their faith in our team,"" said Brawn on the team's official Web site. ""Brawn GP has been through an incredible journey over the last 12 months. From fighting for our survival to forging a strong relationship with Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines, winning both the constructors and drivers world championships, and now accepting Daimler's offer to buy our team, which will secure its future,"" he added.",7,10.21104328611415

""We must address the terrorist threat at its source,"" Brown told lawmakers, adding: ""Our task is to prevent the Taliban from giving al Qaeda ... safe haven. ""Instability in Afghanistan can only increase the risk of conflagration where the rest of the world can least afford it."" Brown regularly links British security to events in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying attacks on London and other British targets have been planned in South Asia. He announced in October the decision in principle to boost force levels, but said certain conditions -- including proper equipment for the British troops and more troop commitments from other countries -- had to be met first. The United Kingdom has the largest contingent in Afghanistan after the United States. The figure of 9,500 does not include special forces, said Brown, who declined to say exactly how many are there, but indicated it is more than 500. Brown's announcement coincided with the news that a British soldier was killed by an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, where troops have been entrenched in heavy combat with Taliban insurgents since July 2006. The soldier, from the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, died as a result of injuries sustained in the Babaji area, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Britain has lost more than 200 service personnel in Afghanistan since the start of fighting in 2001. More than 100 were lost in the past year.",7,7.877150358583345
59489545e8659640fc7fd4bc6b7a4c99db928f3b,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A new study by three universities shows that people holding positions of power with low status tend to demean others, one of the authors said. The research sheds light on why clerks can seem rude or even why the Abu Ghraib guards humiliated and tortured their prisoners, the researcher said. In an article to be published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers studied the relationship between the status and the power of a job, said Nathanael Fast, assistant professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. The study, ""The Destructive Nature of Power without Status,"" determined that the combination of some authority and little perceived status can be toxic. ""We found that people who had high power and high status, they were pretty cool,"" Fast told CNN. ""But it was people who had power and lacked status who used their power to require other persons to engage in demeaning behavior."" In a field of study where psychologists and business schools are now jointly looking at how power shapes business relationships, the study's authors examined the notions of how low status is ""threatening and aversive"" and how power ""frees people to act on their internal states and feelings,"" the researchers say. ""The world was shocked when pictures circulated in 2004 showing low-ranking U.S. soldiers physically and sexually abusing prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq,"" the study says. ""One could point to these examples as support for the popular idea that 'power corrupts.' ""However, we believe there is more to the story. Although it is true that the prison guards had power, it is equally true that their roles provided little to no respect and admiration in the eyes of others. They had power but they lacked status. We posit that understanding the combinations of these two variables â€” power and status â€” produces key insights into the causes of destructive and demeaning behavior,"" the study says. The researchers held experiments with students who were randomly assigned a high-status ""idea producer"" role or low-status ""worker"" role. The students were asked to select from a list of 10 activities for the others to perform. Five of the most demeaning commands were: Say ""I'm filthy"" five times, say ""I am not worthy"" five times, bark like a dog three times, state three negative personal traits and count backward from 500 in increments of seven. The least five demeaning activities were: Write a short essay on your experiences today, say a funny joke, clap hands 50 times, do five pushups, and jump up and down 10 times on one leg, the study said. The research found that ""individuals in high-power/low-status roles chose more demeaning activities for their partners (e.g., bark like a dog, say ""I am filthy"") than did those in any other combination of power and status roles."" ""Our findings indicate that the experience of having power without status, whether as a member of the military or a college student participating in an experiment, may be a catalyst for producing demeaning behaviors that can destroy relationships and impede goodwill,"" the study said. Remedies to such situations include upper management telling persons in high-power/low-status posts ""how important these roles are, so that they have status,"" Fast said. The promise of bonuses or promotions could also help, Fast said. But not all people in such posts are so disagreeable, he added. ""There are a lot of people in these roles who treat others well, and that's probably a function of personality,"" Fast added. ""I don't want everyone in these roles to say, 'Wait a minute, I don't act that way.' There are other moderators like personality and culture."" The study was also conducted by Nir Halevy, acting assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Adam Galinsky, professor of management and organizations at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""It's important to study power and status because hierarchy is everywhere. You can't get away from it,"" Fast said. ""Whether you're with family and friends, volunteering at a soup kitchen, or working in a big organization, there's always a hierarchy.""",1,8.027428789346576
b2296c90374e8c175ec266b44a4d3e59b12a4c5b,CNN,"(CNN) -- Compared with their U.S. peers, Taobao versus eBay, JD.com versus Amazon, Suning vs. Walmart, the Chinese leading e-commerce players have a much shorter history. However, they will take a bigger e-commerce share from the overall retail space soon. Unlike in the United States, most smaller cities in China have not been penetrated by organized retailers or consumer brands yet. This offers an opportunity for e-commerce to become the mainstream retail format for these cities. Another reason is that the cost of commercial property in China went up significantly in the last decade. Thus, consumer brands and retail merchants are more encouraged to migrate online while in the United States, offline to online migration is mainly driven by labor cost and efficiency request. If not in 2013, no later than 2014, China's e-commerce will have a bigger gross merchandise volume than in the United States. Please be aware that China's total retail sales is still much smaller than the U.S., which further demonstrates that e-commerce's share in China will be much more significant. 2015, a breakthrough year for e-commerce in China . Why 2015? We need to understand the emerging cyber history in China. Almost all of China's leading Internet players' birthdays are in 1999, including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Sina and Sohu, etc. In other words, there were no Internet applications until 2000. People born on or after 1980 were over 20 years old in by 2000. They started to get access to the Internet mostly after their campus lives. We call them a generation working in Internet. Take a look at people born on or after 1985. They were teenagers in 2000 when the Internet was just getting started in China. This post-1985 generation is one that lives on the Internet, and started from social, gaming to almost everything. By 2015, this post-1985 generation is reaching their 30s and becoming the core consumer group for almost every category. They have already migrated to the virtual space and they are the mainstream consumption power in China. E-commerce will take such consumption power and make offline retail even weaker. Different ecommerce business model is a MUST . Although I put Taobao.com versus eBay, JD.com vs. Amazon.com, Suning versus Walmart into respective peer group, they do not run the same business models and they don't even look similar anymore. Why the e-commerce model needs to be so different, we need to answer this question from a consumer angle and a merchant angle. As we mentioned above, Chinese Internet consumers are younger, and they're not mainstream yet. Most of them have never been served by organized, retailed or consumer brands yet. Taobao.com can evolve from an online flea market to T-mall and become the shopping entry portal, while eBay finds itself having difficulty getting rid of its secondhand products from its auction site. From a merchant's point of view, there are millions of small but professional merchants in China, they will not just fill up Taobao.com but they will also flood into JD.com and Suning.com and become a major sales force in China. Any e-commerce platform's success depends on winning these millions of merchants and they will make the pure online retail model very difficult in China. Behind these millions of merchants are hundreds of thousands of factories in China. This is why such phenomenon does not exist in the United States where you can hardly find any manufacturers. The monetization model in China for e-commerce is also very different. Advertising model is better accepted by millions of small merchants rather than transaction fee or listing fees. Even service powered by e-commerce needs a different model and will have a different future. When Groupon is under challenge in the United States, I believe that few Chinese survivors, like Meituan.com, from thousands of Chinese Groupons will have a brighter future than its original. The brighter future is based on at least one-third of restaurants and other small and medium business changing hands every year and their ongoing marketing demand will offer companies like Meituan.com almost endless merchants list for promotion. On the other hand, the price sensitive consumers will be addicted to such service. Winning tips for foreign players in China . Google, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon, and Groupon, as part of a very long list of U.S. Internet and e-commerce giants, have tried different ways through set-up by themselves, acquisition, joint venture with local key players, none of them can claim any success in China yet. Unlike other Internet applications, the e-commerce sector is least regulated and restricted by Chinese authorities in comparison to other Internet verticals. In my opinion, U.S. players cannot offer the real value to local consumers since their global technology and supply chain advantage cannot be leveraged in China. The cross-border management slows down the quick reaction required in this fast-moving market. My advice for U.S. players is to humbly buy in minority shares in some emerging Chinese e-commerce players and focus on cross-border synergies, such as cross-border tourism, education or shopping behaviors, etc. These cross-border activities will be growing more rapidly and such synergy can really leverage U.S. peers' strength and offer real value to Chinese consumers.",4,11.450753031914124
0f9de9c3e4f1d0d039b58041c54d3e8a3d4fe13d,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Republicans appear to think North Carolina has the answer to their latest conundrum: how to sidestep growing calls for extending unemployment benefits for the 1.3 million Americans who depend on them without looking like uncompassionate conservatives. A measure to renew Emergency Unemployment Compensation died in this Senate last week and it's unclear, given that Congress must now focus on a spending bill, when senators will revisit the bill. Last year, North Carolina's jobless rate fell to a five-year low after Gov. Pat McCrory and the Republican-controlled legislature slashed unemployment benefits. The reason for this, wrote Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, is that unemployment is ""intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits."" ""If the unemployed have a source of income,"" she wrote in Politico, ""they are more likely to turn down lower-paying jobs -- even though they are losing job skills by remaining out of the labor force. The longer the unemployed are out of work, the more their skills atrophy. It is a vicious cycle leading to more long-term unemployment, a characteristic of this recession."" This formulation achieves two things. One, it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension: Jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work. Two, it provides a moral rationale: Discontinuing jobless insurance is the right thing to do. As U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, noted in the Lexington Herald-Leader: ""You could argue that conservatives who argue for shorter unemployment benefits actually have more concern for the worker than liberals who believe in no limits. Conservatives want to get every able-bodied person back into the work force."" While there's little doubt that Paul wants ""every able-bodied person back in the work force,"" there is ample reason to believe he and others have it upside down and backward. Jobless insurance isn't a cause of unemployment. That's caused by an economy that, on its own, would take more than seven years, by one estimate, to return to pre-2008 levels. What's more, Paul's clumsy attempt to retake the moral high ground reflects another puzzle that no Republican or Democrat has thus far faced: How can we continue to promote the values of freedom, hard work and self-reliance when even a full-time job isn't enough to get by? There's one aspect that Furchtgott-Roth omits, and it's a whopper. Indeed, as she noted, some overqualified people surely settled for low-wage, no-benefit jobs after Raleigh cut their jobless insurance. But the more important reason why North Carolina's unemployment rate went down is plain to see: People stopped looking for work. More precisely, they stopped being counted. According to the Department of Labor's most recent jobs report, the U.S. economy added far fewer jobs than expected (74,000 compared to 200,000) but the unemployment rate fell. Why? Because of something called the ""participation rate."" That's the Labor Department's best guess measure of the number of those who are currently working and those who are looking for work. December saw the lowest participation rate in four decades. A low employment rate may be good for politics (making the rounds is an impressive graph depicting a thin blue line dramatically falling over the course of President Barack Obama's time in office). But a low participation rate is bad for the economy and for everyone. It suggests an array of social ills, like millions of educated young people who can't get their lives started. But it also comes at a time when in Washington the need for balanced budgets trumps the need for jobs, and when all the tools used to counteract the panic of 2008 -- including ""the stimulus,"" food stamps, unemployment benefits and the Federal Reserve's monthly infusion of $80 billion -- have expired or are expiring. This year may reveal just how bad the real economy is. The Republicans no doubt fear that if they agree to an extension of unemployment benefits, or compromise on any safety net program, that they won't get the credit. The Democrats will. And unlike the Democrats, who would be rewarded in this year's midterm elections, the Republicans would be punished by voters who believe welfare is, as one congressman put it, ""legalized plunder."" Such is the price for politicizing formerly nonpartisan economic issues. But the Republicans face a philosophical conundrum as well as a political one. As Senator Paul noted: ""The Republican Party has always proposed ideas of less government and more freedom."" But if the economy on its own is incapable of creating the 7.4 million jobs needed to return to ""normal,"" what does such a formulation mean? In terms of the long-term unemployed, it means less government equals less freedom, a lot less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Stoehr.",5,10.47589793124307
0d65da6aba9669924d29b911f0ac25153c844ace,CNN,"(CNN) -- A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court this week. Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said. The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. ""My first feeling is extreme sadness,"" said Hallie Adams, the former wife. ""I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing."" Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. ""I'm embarrassed to live in Texas,"" said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games. The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet ""to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time,"" Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. ""It was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" she said last November. ""It wasn't any huge happening or anything."" She said she told her father she had the video, ""and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it."" The video posting said, ""Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter."" The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, ""What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."" At another point, he yells at her, ""You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"" William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him. As a judge, William Adams handles misdemeanor cases, including family-related and juvenile court issues.",1,11.505116091807185
980ac57e94011289e9d8482bb94601c1df1b1dd1,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Before Wednesday's Delaware Senate debate, the bulk of what people knew about Republican candidate Christine O'Donnell came from clips from a talk show from the 1990s. In the month since O'Donnell rocked the political world with her upset win over Rep. Mike Castle in the Republican primary, she's dominated headlines despite avoiding the national media. Wednesday's debate, co-moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer and longtime Delaware news anchor Nancy Karibjanian, could prove to be make or break for O'Donnell's Senate bid. She and Democrat Chris Coons are vying to fill the seat held for nearly four decades by now-Vice President Joe Biden . The debate gave O'Donnell an opportunity to reintroduce herself to voters, define her views and chip away at the 19-point deficit she must overcome to defeat Coons. It also provided a chance to do the opposite. O'Donnell and Coons focused largely on the economy and national issues during their 90-minute exchange. Updates from Delaware . O'Donnell threw rocks at Coons throughout the debate, while he tried to paint her answers as frivolous and unintelligible. ""Coons can can barely contain his disdain for his opponent,"" noted Gloria Borger, a senior political analyst for CNN. The debate produced a few humorous moments, such as when Coons said O'Donnell's well-publicized statements that she dabbled in witchcraft and questioned evolution theory were distractions instead of a substantive campaign issue. ""You're just jealous that you weren't on Saturday Night Live,"" O'Donnell said, referring to the comedy show's satirical skit about her. ""I'm dying to see who's going to play me,"" Coons responded with a smile. The debate was tense and O'Donnell was feisty -- until a flub near the end. O'Donnell was tripped up by the same question that caused problems for then-VP candidate Sarah Palin in her interview with Katie Couric about Supreme Court decisions. Asked if she could name a recent Supreme Court case she disagreed with, O'Donnell said, ""can you give me a specific one?"" O'Donnell was unable to provide a case, but said decisions she disagreed with would be posted on her website. While the forum was one of the most anticipated events of the campaign season, not everyone was as captivated. ""Even if I lived in [Delaware,] I wouldn't watch. I already know about this woman to question everything she has done. Her ethics and character leave a lot to be desired,"" commented CNN reader Marie MD. Commenter Laverne planned to tune in for the entertainment. ""Anybody in their right mind will be able to tell right away if she is truly knowledgeable of the topics,"" the reader said. Delaware voters had varying impressions of the debate. Bob Ashby said O'Donnell did a good job showing who she really is. ""I think that Christine O'Donnell needed to show that she's a human being, a real person and that she's impassioned, that all this other sort of conversation that's been going on about her is not really accurate. And I think that's what she attempted to do, and I think she did very well with that,"" he said. But voter Lisa Lucas was hardly impressed. ""I find it abundantly disconcerting that we have this much in common with Wasilla,"" she said. ""Even if you have some concerns about Chris Coons' history or his politics or whatever, yet again, we have a polarized election where it's a black and white thing, because she is so far off the grid."" Another voter, identified by her first name only, said that after watching the debate, she decided she wasn't voting for either candidate. ""I just feel that Christine O'Donnell doesn't really answer any questions. She goes very circular on things. And I just feel like Chris Coons has been kind of condescending. And it's just I don't get a good feeling from either candidate,"" Meghan told CNN. Immediate reaction from the blogosphere was also mixed. The Conservative Journal said the debate ""didn't have a clear cut winner as far as who answered better,"" but it predicted O'Donnell would benefit most. The blog gave credit to both candidates for substantive answers, but was turned off by Coons' ""snide retorts."" The left-leaning blog Talking Points Memo said that while O'Donnell may have mastered her talking points, she ""had a tough time this evening with some basic questions about issues she'd face if she is elected to the Senate."" How do you think she did? Did O'Donnell win or lose votes based on her performance?",3,5.505316011167787
ee87f63561700ad1d8c46b1ecc4d719cd6d0d8b3,CNN,"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Friday that elections taking place this weekend would not be ""free and fair"" but that her party still hoped to win as many parliamentary seats as possible. Suu Kyi, who was released in 2010 by Myanmar's military rulers after years under house arrest, said that she believed there had been voting irregularities, illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities. But Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at a news conference outside her residence in Yangon that she did not ""at all regret having taken part"" because the election campaign had raised political awareness among Myanmar's population. Worldwide attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar government's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule. The government has invited in hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to witness the voting. The vote, in which credible alternatives to the ruling party will appear on the ballot, was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is in competition for 44 of the 45 seats up for grabs in the by-elections. It had boycotted previous elections. Its candidate in one constituency has been rejected by the election commission because his parents had taken up foreign residency, Suu Kyi said, adding that the party planned to challenge the candidate's exclusion later. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. So far this year, the regime has agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Top diplomats from the United States, Britain and France have made recent visits to the country after decades of shunning it. Suu Kyi said she believed President Thein Sein, a former general who has taken civilian office, wished for democratic reform, but that she was uncertain how much support he had, notably from the military. She told the hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence Friday that she didn't plan on becoming a minister in the military-backed civilian government, if a position was offered to her. Under Myanmar's constitution, lawmakers can't hold ministerial office. Asked where she would place Myanmar's democracy on a scale of one to 10, Suu Kyi quipped, ""We're trying to get to one."" She mentioned two recent physical attacks against NLD candidates, which she said she thought were actions of individuals rather than state-sponsored acts. In one of the attacks, somebody used a catapult to fire betel nuts at a candidate's car, she said. Some people in Southeast Asia chew betel nuts as a mild stimulant. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country. She quietly defied Myanmar's military junta for years from from the prison of her crumbling Inya Lake villa in the former capital, Yangon. Suu Kyi, 66, is now a candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kawhmu, a contest analysts say she is all but certain to win. Results are expected about a week after the voting. Suu Kyi has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies where she is often greeted like a rock star. But her busy schedule has taken its toll: earlier this week she had to suspend campaigning after falling ill. On Friday, she said she felt somewhat ""delicate,"" but was in good enough spirits to joke about her health. She told the reporters at the news conference that if they asked ""any tough questions, I'll faint straight away.""

df007bab50278cde14ecba0c5da8f4b4eab74d2f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Economists might not like how quickly the economy has or has not rebounded from the recession, but if the country is still struggling financially, someone forgot to tell the Tooth Fairy. American children are receiving an average of $3.70 per lost tooth this year -- up 23% from last year's $3, an annual survey said. Visa Inc.'s annual survey, based on 3,000 telephone interviews, reported that 90% of U.S. households will be receiving a visit from the Tooth Fairy this year. The fairy was most generous to children in the Northeast, who earned an average of $4.10 per tooth. In the Midwest, children received $3.30 per tooth; and the South and West fell in the middle, at $3.60 and $3.70, respectively. Male tooth fairies leave more than female, and in 36% of households, tooth fairies left less than a dollar. Families with a household income of $40,000 to $45,000 gave more than any other income group. Jason Alderman, senior director of global financial education for Visa Inc., said the reason for that might be that it's an ""area where parents can feel like they can be generous."" While the study isn't necessarily proof of out-of-control inflation, Alderman said the study, inspired by his daughter, will hopefully inspire other parents to give their children a financial education. ""My daughter had zero interest in money,"" he said. ""Money management wasn't interesting to her."" But, he said, she was transfixed by the idea of the Tooth Fairy leaving something behind when she finally lost a tooth. Alderman saw this as an opportunity for a ""teachable moment."" ""Parents can then talk to their kids about how they plan to spend their money. They can use real money to talk about saving and giving,"" he said. That's a great idea, unless, of course, you give your child an antique typewriter. That's exactly what Alderman said one of his son's classmates received for a lost tooth. ""I'm still not sure how you fit a typewriter under a pillow,"" he said. While elaborate gifts are the exception, 6% in the survey said the Tooth Fairy left $20 or more; 2% said she left $50. With such a wide spectrum, parents of children losing their first teeth might find it hard deciding what the Tooth Fairy should give. ""Nobody wants to be the cheapskate; no one wants to give too much,"" Alderman said. For those parents, he said, Visa created an app that allows people to enter demographics information -- like household income and age -- to give a better idea of what tooth fairies who live like them are giving. Alderman said he's always given his kids a dollar for their lost teeth, which seemed to be the standard in the neighborhood (minus the typewriter, of course). ""No one wants to be the parent their kid is talking about on the playground,"" he said.",0,12.255931249446245

The meat in question was processed at Fruitland American Meat in Jackson, Missouri, and distributed to a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut, which services its New England stores, and a restaurant in New York City and another one in Kansas City, Missouri. The beef was produced and packaged between September 2013 and April 2014. The inspectors found no indication any of the animals slaughtered showed signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the formal name of mad cow disease. In a statement issued by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, a spokesperson said: ""All of these animals received full inspection, both before and after slaughter, by FSIS personnel and showed no abnormal signs or symptoms associated with BSE. ""Out of an abundance of caution, FSIS issued a Class II recall (a remote risk) for product that does not have paperwork showing that nerve tissue was removed. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products."" The USDA requires brain and spinal tissue be removed from meat products from cattle 3 years and older because it can carry the protein that causes mad cow disease. People who consume meat tainted with mad cow disease could develop a rare, fatal disease in humans called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The first cases of vCJD were first reported in 1996, and so far a total of 229 patients with this disease from 12 countries have been identified, according to the CDC.

""They're going to have to live and rebuild and recover,"" Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in Birmingham. ""Give them the respect that they're a survivor, not a victim."" Fugate was joined by several members of President Barack Obama's Cabinet, including heads of the departments of homeland security, agriculture, and housing and urban development. They saw destruction in Birmingham, then headed west to Smithville, Mississippi, where 15 of the town's less than 900 people perished due to the powerful twister. See photos of the devastation . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano explained that the group was diverse in order to best leverage the potential of the federal government, as it worked to help states, municipalities and ultimately individuals. She vowed that this effort will involve short-term fixes and a long-term committment in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and other states hit the hardest. ""We will work (the affected) states as well, and those communities as well, to help them recover from this spring of storms -- and to come back strongly,"" Napolitano said. About 148 devastating twisters Wednesday left a wide swath of death and destruction across 13 states. The death toll had climbed to 339 Sunday, according to emergency management officials in six of those states. On Sunday, some of those killed were laid to rest while others attended religious services, hoping to make sense of the calamity. iReport pictures from Tuscaloosa area . A tornado demolished the Smithville Baptist Church in Mississippi.

Our world will never be the same. This moment will forever be etched in the forefront of all our imaginations,"" White said. Hours later, the small town played host to Napolitano, Fugate and other members of the Obama administration. They noted that, despite the massive destruction, only 22 people are in shelters because most of those impacted were taken in by relatives, neighbors and fellow church members. This fact showed the strong community in Smithville and vicinity, but did not diminish the tremendous suffering and long-term challenges ahead, the officials said. Surgeon: 'I was just in shock' ""When the Piggly Wiggly is not open, it's real bad, folks,"" Fugate said. ""It don't get much worse ... This is going to be a tough recovery, but you are survivors. That's why we're here."" The administration officials said assistance will be offered -- and red tape circumvented -- to help with everything from patching roofs to aiding the local timber industry to rebuilding businesses. They urged those affected to phone FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to get registered and learn about the process. In many communities, the struggle is daunting. Throughout Alabama -- the hardest-hit state -- the death toll Sunday morning was 250 and the number of injured was 2,219, emergency management officials said. Nearly a half million customers in the state remained without power. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said his city, where at least 39 people have died, faces a ""humanitarian crisis.""

""We're just going down there to deliver food. Some people have been there 40, 50 years and they're not leaving."" In the Hispanic community, volunteer Martin Izaguirre said, many are afraid to go to shelters. He said some have told him, ""We are afraid we won't be welcomed in places where Spanish is not spoken."" While searchers fan out, some have taken a more high-tech approach.

c7a2f14b6f263c23bf105113c4820ab3e09aa955,CNN,"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian rebels and the government are in ""exploratory"" talks to end the country's nearly 50-year armed conflict, President Juan Manuel Santos said Monday. Speaking on national TV, the president said military operations would continue alongside any negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. The FARC, which has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, is Latin America's oldest insurgency. ""We have developed exploratory talks with the FARC to seek an end to the conflict,"" said Santos, whose popularity has suffered because of the widespread perception that security has worsened under his leadership. He vowed to avoid the mistakes of the past. ""Colombians can rest assured that the government is acting with prudence, seriousness and firmness -- always putting first the welfare and peace of all residents,"" the president said. Santos invited members of a second rebel group -- the National Liberation Army, or ELN -- to also join in the talks. Earlier, current and former government sources told CNN that the government and rebels met in Cuba to discuss the possibility of peace. Present at the discussions, the sources said, were members of the FARC and representatives of Santos. The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with media. Previously on CNN.com: Indigenous groups clash with Colombian soldiers . The Venezuelan government was reportedly key to bringing the two sides together, the sources said. Peace talks between the rebels and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country, in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. Since then, the sides have reached a kind of ""hurting stalemate,"" said Adam Isacson, senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. Though severely weakened in recent years, the FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. ""Neither side thinks they're going to win anytime soon,"" said Isacson. ""What they're looking at is losing thousands more people, with nothing to show for it."" Of course, it remains unclear whether the two sides will reach an agreement at all, and if they do, what that deal might look like. It's also unclear how much of the FARC the group's leadership would be able to deliver, said Isacson. The FARC opened the door for talks this year. In a January statement, rebels said they would be interested in addressing certain issues at a ""hypothetical negotiating table,"" calling on the government to address such subjects as privatization, deregulation and environmental degradation. The statement was signed by the FARC's leader, known as Timoleon Jimenez. ""This conflict will have no solution until our voices are heard. Without lies, Santos, without lies,"" the statement read. This spring, the FARC freed the last of 10 government hostages after holding them for more than a decade. In February, the rebel group said it would also stop kidnapping civilians for money. It did not address the fate of its civilian captives, nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes. Hundreds of civilians remain prisoners of the guerrilla group throughout Colombia, according to the nonprofit Free Country Foundation.

57839f10a9b65363ba6692a76482994ece970e95,CNN,"Paris, France (CNN) -- The French Senate approved Tuesday a law banning any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women -- making France the first European country to plan such a measure. The law passed by a vote of 246 to 1, with about 100 abstentions coming essentially from left-leaning politicians. The legislation was overwhelmingly approved by the lower house of parliament in July and will go into effect next spring. French people back the ban by a margin of more than four to one, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found in a survey earlier this year. Some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban, while 17 percent disapproved. That was the widest support the Washington-based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed. Clear majorities also backed burqa bans in Germany, Britain and Spain, while two out of three Americans opposed it, the survey found. A panel of French lawmakers recommended a ban last year, and lawmakers unanimously passed a non-binding resolution in May calling the full-face veil contrary to the laws of the nation. ""Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place,"" the French government said when it sent the measure to parliament in May. The law imposes a fine of 150 euros ($190) and/or a citizenship course as punishment for wearing a face-covering veil. Forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa will be punishable by a year in prison or a 15,000-euro ($19,000) fine, the government said, calling it ""a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."" The French Council of State has warned that the ban could be incompatible with international human rights laws and the country's own constitution. The council advises on laws, but the government is not required to follow its recommendations. The ban pertains to the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil that leaves an opening only for the eyes. The hijab, which covers the hair and neck but not the face, and the chador, which covers the body but not the face, apparently are not banned by the law. However, a 2004 law in France bans the wearing or displaying of overt religious symbols in schools -- including the wearing of headscarves by schoolgirls. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that France has about 3.5 million Muslims, or about 6 percent of the population. France does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population, in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular.

The 2011 Asian Cup champions had been one of two countries invited to take part as guests at the 12-team South American event, due to be held in Argentina from July 1-24. But Japan Football Association president Junji Ogura traveled to Paraguay on Monday to meet his South American counterparts and ask that the ""Samurai Blue"" not participate alongside Mexico. ""He believes the priority now is to try to save lives and reconstruction,"" CONMEBOL spokesman Nestor Benitez said in a statement on Monday.

30480e09b214b73b116f933146f645c146838d51,CNN,"(CNN) -- Fire up the griddle! Much of a huge cache of maple syrup snatched from a Quebec storage facility has been recovered, police say. Three people have been arrested and five others are being sought in connection with the theft from a warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec Provincial Police said in a statement Tuesday. The theft occurred between August 2011 and July 2012, police said. Two-thirds of the syrup was recovered, according to a police statement. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, which bills itself as keeper of the global strategic maple syrup reserve, said in August that up to 10 million pounds of the sweet stuff was in the warehouse from which the theft occurred but could not say exactly how much was missing. The total value of all the syrup in the warehouse was put at $30 million. The theft was discovered during a routine inventory check of the warehouse, which ""had been secured by a fence and locks, and visited regularly,"" federation president Serge Beaulieu said in a statement in August. The barrels that originally contained the syrup were empty, meaning it was somehow transferred to other containers to complete the theft, the federation said. Police said Tuesday that they had seized vehicles that were used to transport the stolen sticky stuff as well as carts, lifts, scales and kettles. They said their investigation of the thefts covered the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario as well as the northern United States. Almost 300 people were interviewed as part of the investigation, police said. As much as 80% of the world's maple syrup comes from Quebec, the federation says.",1,10.818717193003735
3327860fcde08cca9c9c2ff7fcc0d43bebc85674,CNN,"London (CNN) -- As Britain segues seamlessly through feelgood summer heat from Andy Murray mania to royal baby euphoria, let us at least spare a thought for the unfortunate newborn caught, through no fault other than his ancestry, in the global spotlight. No royal arrival has been so closely scrutinized since 1688 when Mary of Modena, wife of the widely disliked James II, gave birth watched by dozens of officials amid speculation that her pregnancy was a Catholic conspiracy intended to fabricate a male heir. Even their presence was not enough to quash rumors that the child had been smuggled into the birthing chamber in a bedpan, and within months James had been deposed; his son was destined to spend his life in bitter exile in France and Rome. At least the newborn prince and his parents are unlikely to be run out of the country, even if the flag-waving royalists celebrating the birth are hardly representative of a silent majority largely apathetic about the monarchy and more inclined to treat its modern incarnation as a publicly-subsidized soap opera largely staged for the amusement of American tourists. 'Wicked' author: Royal baby stands for hope . Nor did his mother suffer the indignity of having the home secretary in the vicinity of the delivery room, a custom for royal births only formally ended in 1948. And there have undoubtedly been worse times in history to be born into one of Europe's great royal dynasties. Paris in 1789 springs to mind, or St. Petersburg in 1917. Yet the life prospects of a boy now third in line to the British crown who, if as lucky in longevity as his paternal great-grandparents, might reasonably expect to see in the 22nd century on the throne, are hardly something to be envied. The Windsors may have recovered some of their respectability after the nadir in their fortunes in the 1990s that culminated in the 1997 death of Princess Diana, thanks in no small part to the fairy-tale mega-wedding of William and Kate in 2011 and Oscar-winning propaganda such as ""The Queen"" and ""The King's Speech."" To question the role of the monarchy and Britons' attachment to it is still to risk a public flogging from more reactionary sections of the British media, as author Hilary Mantel discovered when she found herself pilloried earlier this year for describing the Duchess of Cambridge as a ""plastic princess designed to breed."" The resulting furore missed the point that Mantel was trying to make, which was that members of the royal family, however privileged and luxurious their lives, are essentially prisoners of their own circumstances, trapped by their supposed obligations to an archaic and largely redundant institution. ""Our current royal family doesn't have the difficulties in breeding that pandas do, but pandas and royal persons alike are expensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment. But aren't they interesting? Aren't they nice to look at?"" said Mantel. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy better . If Mantel's point was essentially true of Kate Middleton, who, like a mafia wife, married into the firm of her own volition, how much worse must the situation be for her offspring, who will become public property from the moment he is displayed to the assembled world media on the hospital steps. The mainstream media may feign responsibility, keeping a respectful distance as the young family find their feet and honoring royal requests to leave the child alone, but he will still face near constant public intrusion, living a life framed by the ubiquitous lens of the camera phone. And in an age obsessed with the oxymoronic phenomena of ""reality"" and celebrity, the young royal will be forced to perform a gilded simulation of a normality that he will never experience for real, ultimately embracing the stiflingly conservatism of a British establishment of which the monarchy remains the apex, and allowing their personality to be airbrushed according to public tastes. It will be ""The Truman Show"" with footmen. Royals, for better or worse, once inhabited worlds of intrigue, conspiracy and high drama, their lives, relationships and deaths entwined with the rise and fall of nations and empires. The feats and misdeeds of kings, queens and their progeny were fodder for Shakespearean epics. Yet it is centuries since the British royal family played anything more than a decorative role in the life of the nation -- and this new heir may have to wait the best part of this century before assuming even those diminished duties. Opinion: How to raise a royal baby . Royal heirs have traditionally passed the years waiting for their relatives to die by becoming champions of worthy causes. Prince Charles is famed for his woolly opinions on environmentalism and architecture, while Prince William has leant his support to the campaign to tackle homelessness. Perhaps, out of enlightened self-interest alone and with time on his side, the prince could one day become the first royal to embrace the cause of republicanism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Hooper.",7,7.697128153454015
4c64ecda750de6d3b4255eb9c90620db1e7c3354,CNN,"(CNN) -- The pictures might be NSFW -- at least if you're looking at them over lunch -- but Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson was certainly working it on Sunday. Donning red lipstick, a flight attendant's skirt and high heels, the maverick businessman served drinks, made intercom announcements and chatted up passengers on an AirAsia X flight from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur. A little recap. Two years ago, Branson and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes wagered on their Formula 1 racing teams, each man betting his own team would finish ahead of the other's in the 2010 Formula 1 Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. The loser would have to serve as a female flight attendant on the winner's airline. Branson lost. On Sunday, he honored the bet by serving on a special AirAsia X charity flight. Branson wore heavy makeup, including fake eyelashes and bright red lipstick. At a cocktail event in Perth the night before the flight, he had his legs shaved, but managed to keep his mustache. ""This has been a real first for me but I have enjoyed the experience and I have nothing but respect for what our fabulous flight attendants do every day to keep us safe,"" said Branson after the flight. ""He is an entrepreneur, visionary, knight and adventurer, Sir Richard can now also add AirAsia flight attendant to his long list of credentials,"" joked Fernandes. During the five-and-a-half-hour flight, Branson poured coffee and tea, served meals, distributed merchandise, made in-flight announcements and entertained the passengers, according to an AirAsia statement. He also accidentally (read: deliberately) tipped a tray of drinks over Fernandes during the flight. The two are close friends. For each seat sold for the event, AirAsia X is donating A$100 ($100) to Starlight Children's Foundation, an Australia-based organization dedicated to seriously ill and hospitalized children and their families. The event raised approximately $200,000 for the charity.",7,8.893305640436509
68fb2ca295b041b899e5f08c20def9f983270606,CNN,"(CNN) -- Pope Francis has made clear that ""wealth and income inequality is a moral issue"" that needs addressing as a priority. Expect President Barack Obama to address that theme strongly during his State of the Union address Tuesday -- but for very different political reasons. Barack Obama will make economic inequality central to his 2014 agenda in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The president's speech will be watched intensely not just in the United States, but right across the world. This is because, right now, inequality is a very salient issue internationally. And, interestingly, it is not just politicians, but also other prominent figures (including, most notably, Pope Francis) who are championing this agenda. Less than a year into his papacy, Francis has already criticized what he sees as modern society's ""idolatry of money."" He has clearly stated that ""wealth and income inequality is a moral issue"" that needs addressing as a priority. And in a sign that Obama recognizes the growing international momentum behind this issue, the White House last week announced that the president will travel to the Vatican in late March. The talks will center around the ""shared commitment [of the Pope and President] to fighting global poverty and growing inequality."" Obama's State of the Union address, and his March meeting with the Pope, will not just bring global attention to this agenda. It will also encourage campaigning on similar themes by politicians around the world, especially from the left of center. To date, mainstream left parties in many countries have failed to capitalize electorally, particularly in Europe, on the last few years of economic downturn that has been the most acute period of crisis since at least the 1930s. But, the fortunes of the center left could yet be on the turn. In Europe, for instance, UK Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband hopes to win office next year on a platform of voter discontent in the country over stagnant living standards. Meanwhile, Canada's Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau is championing a narrative of the struggling middle class in advance of the 2015 ballot in that country. And, in New Zealand, Labour Party Leader David Cunliffe hopes to seize power by exploiting economic inequality issues in an election expected this year. Meanwhile, in the United States, the White House calculates that a core economic fairness agenda has the potential to reboot Obama's flailing second term of office, and prove a winning national theme for the Democratic Party in November's mid-term congressional elections. To this end, Obama plans to use his address to build popular support, and also press for specific proposals to address income inequality, including extending jobless-benefits, and expanding the federal minimum wage to at least $10. Professor Johannes Lindvall's fascinating research on the political consequences of the Great Depression, and the post 2008/09 Great Recession, is potentially illuminating about the left of center's political prospects in coming years. He has shown that the electoral implications of both of these defining historical moments were similar to begin with: conservative parties generally performed stronger in ballots than the mainstream left soon after both economic crises began. As Lindvall asserts, this could be potentially explained, in part, by the fact that the initial trauma of both the Great Depression and Great Recession were widely perceived as so significant that many middle class voters cast their lot in with conservative parties which were seen as better able to tackle the crisis. In the two years after 2008/09 alone, for instance, center-left parties lost ground, or were jolted by significant electoral losses in countries in Asia-Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), to Europe (Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) and North America (in the 2010 U.S. mid-term elections). What is potentially even more interesting, however, is that Lindvall found that once the Great Depression was no longer seen by voters as a major continuing threat, the political pendulum tended to swing back toward parties of the center left. Of course, it is by no means certain that history will repeat itself. Lindvall, for instance, notes that politicians of the mainstream left today have less new agenda setting ideas and policy options than in the 1930s when an era of expansionary fiscal policies and welfare programmes blossomed. Nonetheless, the longer the legacy of the 2008/09 crisis continues to bite, from higher youth unemployment to stagnant living standards, the greater the opportunities could be for the centre left to benefit. Now as in the 1930s, economic hardship is being felt in many countries not just by the poor, but also the middle classes. And, it is this discontent that left-of-center politicians, including Obama, Miliband, Trudeau, and Cunliffe, are seeking to tap into.

e93e084635885eb8c8ca6827d39233708af124c2,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Mexican government condemned the U.S. Border Patrol's use of lethal force that resulted in the death of an apparently undocumented migrant on the California-Mexico border this week. The migrant was identified by Mexican authorities as Mexican national Jesus Flores Cruz. ""We also firmly reiterate that the use of lethal force in border control operations is unacceptable. The Government of Mexico expects the results of the investigations and that those responsible be held accountable,"" the Secretariat of Foreign Relations said in a statement Thursday. The Mexican government is seeking a thorough investigation of the incident. Since January 2010, at least 28 individuals have died as the result of an encounter with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, said the activist group Southern Border Communities Coalition. At least 27 deaths resulted from the use of lethal force, and one person died after not receiving adequate medical attention, the group said. On Tuesday, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed an apparently undocumented migrant who allegedly threw rocks at the agent, striking his face, on the border near San Diego, authorities said. A social justice advocacy group criticized the Border Patrol's use of deadly force in the incident, saying there's a disturbing trend of Border Patrol ""killings of rock throwers, some of whom were teenagers and some whom were U.S. citizens"" on the U.S.-Mexico border, said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego. The Border Patrol declined to comment directly on this week's incident, which is under investigation by local authorities, but in the past, the agency has highlighted how agents are seriously injured in rock-throwing incidents and resort to lethal force to protect themselves. Guerrero said, however, some police experts advise using nonlethal force such as pepper-ball guns to respond to rock throwings. ""Border agents should adhere to best policing practices and only use lethal force as a last resort, not the only resort,"" Guerrero said. Rock-throwing incidents have been controversial on the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when Mexicans have thrown projectiles from the Mexico side of the international line toward Border Patrol agents on the U.S. side. In some cases, U.S. Border Patrol agents have fired their guns at the rock throwers on the Mexico side of the border, killing the rock thrower. Mexican officials have condemned the Border Patrol's use of lethal force as excessive. The U.S. Border Patrol said the incident occurred in a rugged section of the Otay Mountains near San Diego where the agent was trying to arrest several immigrants who crossed the border illegally. Two other undocumented migrants were arrested and in custody, the agency said. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the killing, said in its account that two Border Patrol agents were trying to detain a group of suspected undocumented migrants in rugged terrain in the mountain's White Cross area about four miles east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. The border patrol agent who fired his service weapon suffered minor injuries, the sheriff's homicide unit said. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.",1,8.07912831765412
73921e2bb558b95d16285dd950d18ca9508d25fe,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial have one less question to decide after the judge issued a partial directed verdict in favor of Jackson's mother Friday. Katherine Jackson has standing to seek damages against concert promoter AEG Live in the pop icon's death because evidence proved her son provided for ""everything,"" including her household expenses and food, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos said in a ruling Friday afternoon. Lawyers for AEG Live unsuccessfully argued that Jackson's elderly mother could not sue because she was also supported by daughter Janet Jackson. Testimony ended Friday in the five-month-long trial, setting the stage for closing arguments to begin Tuesday. Judge Palazuelos will read her instructions to the jury on Monday. Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011 and sentenced to four years in prison. Murray told police he infused Jackson with the surgical anesthetic propofol for 60 nights to treat his insomnia as he prepared for his comeback concerts. The coroner ruled his death on June 25, 2009, was from a propofol overdose. AEG Live lawyers have argued it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray and that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. The judge cited testimony from Katherine Jackson and a financial expert hired by AEG Live in her partial directed verdict ruling. The defense expert concluded that the Michael Jackson paid for the ""bulk"" of his mother's support, including for her home, transportation, food and insurance, the ruling said. The only evidence AEG Live had supporting their defense was Katherine Jackson's testimony that her youngest daughter, Janet Jackson, gave her $10,000 a month for ""some period of years,"" the judge wrote. ""There is no evidence that Janet Jackson's contributions negated Katherine Jackson's reliance -- to some extent -- on [Michael Jackson's] contributions for the necessaries of life,"" Palazuelos ruled. California law does not allow parents to seek wrongful-death damages if their offspring had other heirs, unless they can prove they were financially dependent on their child. The judge is moving the trial to a much larger courtroom in the downtown Los Angeles courthouse, which will allow more than 300 people to watch closing arguments. The trial began in a courtroom that only seats 60 people.",1,10.158670631925316
4822bd2262ff33fb3eb2841f94c95465de8aa9ab,CNN,"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius broke down and vomited in court Monday as he heard a pathologist testify about his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's injuries after he shot her dead on Valentine's Day last year. The testimony of pathologist Gert Saayman was interrupted by Pistorius' sobbing and retching, leading to a pause in the proceedings. Earlier, Judge Thokozile Masipa imposed a broadcast blackout on Saayman's testimony. Masipa, who has been presiding over the weeklong trial in Pretoria, extended the ban to live reporting on Twitter. Pistorius admits he shot Steenkamp, 29, but says that it was a tragic case of mistaken identity and that he thought she was an intruder who had broken into his home. In court, Saayman confirmed that Steenkamp died from multiple gunshot wounds, consistent with having been hit in the head, arm and hip by three shots fired through the locked door of a toilet cubicle. Pistorius appeared deeply physically distressed throughout the testimony, repeatedly making retching sounds and clutching his head in his hands. The track star, 27, appeared at times to try to cover his ears by clasping his hands behind his neck, or he put his fingers in his ears. His brother and sister came to check on him during the brief break in Saayman's testimony. Security guard on the stand . Saayman said any of the three injuries to Steenkamp could have been fatal and all immediately incapacitating. He said it was probably the bullet to the skull that killed her almost immediately. It passed from the top of her head over her right eye to the base of her skull, suggesting that she was not standing when hit, he added. Saayman said the wounds were consistent with ""ranger"" bullets, which open up ""like the petals of a flower"" to cause maximum tissue damage. Earlier on Monday, defense lawyers challenged a security guard's statements about what happened on the night. Guard Pieter Baba said he talked by phone to Pistorius the night of the killing and Pistorius said ""everything's fine"" or ""everything's OK."" But defense lawyer Barry Roux said Pistorius had said, ""I'm fine."" Baba was adamant, saying, ""What I just told the court is the truth."" Baba's testimony proceeded slowly because all questions and answers had to go through a translator. He gave two statements to police, months apart. On Friday, Baba said he could hear Pistorius was crying and he knew everything was not fine. Read more: First week of the trial -- three bangs, four shots, nine witnesses . Baba arrived at the house in time to witness Pistorius coming down the stairs carrying Steenkamp. ""I was so shocked, I couldn't think for a few moments,"" he testified. Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death. Follow the trial live . Gun at his bedside . Another witness who testified Friday, former Pistorius girlfriend Samantha Taylor, said their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Steenkamp. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked Taylor if she was ever at Pistorius' house when he thought there was an intruder. Taylor said yes. She said Pistorius once heard something hit a bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she'd heard it, too, before taking his gun and going to investigate. Taylor said Pistorius woke her up other times when he thought he'd heard a noise. Taylor also testified that Pistorius slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs and once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car. Taylor said she met Pistorius in 2010, when she was 17, and they started dating the following year. She said they broke up twice, the second time on November 4, 2012, after he took Steenkamp to a sports banquet. Roux asked if Taylor admitted in two e-mails to cheating on Pistorius. Taylor says she's never admitted to cheating on him but admits she had a relationship with another man after they broke up the first time. Roux asked Taylor for details about the time he supposedly shot the gun out of the sunroof, but Taylor could not remember the name of the highway or the location in South Africa. She testified that Pistorius was angry and irritated after the traffic stop, even though he was not driving. She said he joked around about firing a shot and then laughed after he fired. Finding inconsistencies . Nel put four neighbors of Pistorius on the stand in the first week of the trial, all of whom described hearing screaming and loud bangs they thought were gunshots the night of the killing. Roux then tried to find inconsistencies or uncertainty in their stories. The defense goal is to prove there is a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. One of the most dramatic witnesses was a neighbor, Johan Stipp, who rushed to the track star's home the night he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius broke down in court as Stipp said he saw Steenkamp lying on the floor, her brain tissue mixed with blood and Pistorius praying for her to live. ""I remember the first thing he said when I got there was, 'I shot her, I thought she was a burglar and I shot her,' "" Stipp told the court in Pretoria. Although Stipp is a prosecution witness, his testimony may bolster the defense case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said after Thursday's gripping testimony. Prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that Pistorius and Steenkamp had a loud argument before the shooting, suggesting it's the reason he killed her. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Stipp's version of events appears to coincide with the defense case, said Phelps, who teaches law at the University of Cape Town. Trial may last three weeks . Judge Masipa will decide whether Pistorius is innocent or guilty. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts said. The trial is expected to take at least three weeks. Pistorius and Steenkamp were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, whose ""Blade Runner"" nickname reflects the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012. Steenkamp, a model who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right at the time of her death.

35d22b9240d034815afd9fc03edd3a1dcf2df1ae,CNN,"Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- A bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at Munich Airport in Germany on Wednesday may have been a false alarm, German police told CNN. Police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said. Police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives. But authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport. They do not have the laptop case, they said. They are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt. Police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation. Police did not know which flight the man was booked on. Part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened. All planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally. About 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal. The airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident. The incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan. The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is ""infuriating"" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa. Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab ""was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening."" ""Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body,"" Napolitano said.

ff671b6dd9be9cbc9d44cc68b828896021cc5be5,CNN,"(CNN) -- Archaeologists in Israel have discovered what they believe is the bust of a Roman boxer from the second or third century. The figurine is small -- about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide -- but very detailed, archaeologists say. ""It seems that what we have here is a unique find,"" the two directors of the excavation said in a statement released Monday by the Israel Antiquities Authority. The figurine, made of marble, comes from a time when ""the art of Roman sculpture reached its zenith,"" Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets said. It's tiny -- only about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide, Ben-Ami told CNN. ""That's why it is so impressive. It's so small, but still you can see every little detail on the marble,"" he said. The archaeologists believe a merchant family from the eastern part of the Roman Empire most likely passed down the ""precious object"" through the generations until the fourth or fifth century, when an unfortunate family member had it with him at a public building, perhaps a hostel -- and an earthquake struck. A team has been digging up the building in the City of David, part of Jerusalem. The object is part of the ""silent testimony of the drama that occurred in this impressive structure prior to its collapse,"" the Israel Antiquities Authority said. The ""short hair style, the prominent lobes and curves of the ears, as well as the almond-shaped eyes suggest that the object most likely portrays an athlete, probably a boxer,"" the statement said. Little bits of the sculpture have broken off. It is missing part of the nose and mouth, Ben-Ami said. ""The high level of finish on the figurine is extraordinary,"" Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said in their statement. They added: ""To the best of our knowledge, to date no similar artifact made of marble (or any other kind of stone) bearing the same image that was just found has been discovered in excavations elsewhere in the country."" A few similar artifacts made of bronze have been found ""at different sites in the country and they have been found in large numbers in different places throughout the Roman Empire, where the overwhelming majority of them date to the third century CE (the Roman period)."" Two tiny holes in the figurine suggest it was used as a suspended weight together with a balance scale, the archaeologists said. Last month, the excavation team at this same site discovered ""one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever found in Jerusalem,"" the Israel Antiquities Authority said. ""It consists of 264 gold coins and was found at about the same time as a gold earring, inlaid with expensive pearls and remarkably well preserved."" ""Every single object has a story behind it,"" Ben-Ami said in an interview with CNN. ""Behind every object there are people. And, for us, the most important thing is to try to tell the stories behind these items.""",2,10.513128390122938
7aaa60d492664d3e5c1cde7f397d4e4fdc436fd0,CNN,"(CNN) -- ""Carlos the Jackal,"" once among the world's most wanted fugitives, has been sentenced to life in prison for his role in a series of fatal bombings in the 1980s, a French court said. The 62-year-old, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was on trial for his role in the attacks on two trains, a train station and a newspaper office in France in 1982 and 1983. The bombings killed 11 and injured more than 100. He was sentenced late Thursday. The Venezuelan-born revolutionary has been serving another life sentence in France since 1997, when he was convicted for the shooting deaths of two French secret agents and an informant in 1975. Ramirez, who was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, first made headlines in 1975 when he led an attack on an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting in Vienna that took at least 60 people hostage, including 11 oil ministers. He was nicknamed ""Carlos the Jackal"" by the press, a reference to the principal character and assassin in Frederick Forsyth's novel ""The Day of the Jackal."" After two decades on the run, Ramirez was captured in 1994 in Sudan and taken to Paris in a sack. The seven-judge terrorism panel ruled after the trial that began in November.",1,6.662606148450117

b6113e50db897763dec519d0d6a80c646a2f90ea,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Personal details and photographs of the incoming head of Britain's international spy agency have been posted on Facebook, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband acknowledged Sunday. The UK's Foreiogn Office says foreign service staff should exercise caution on social-networking Web sites. But he insisted that no compromising information had been revealed. ""You know he wears Speedo, swim, swimming, swimsuit... I mean what is that? I mean, that's not a state secret,"" Miliband said on a BBC Sunday morning talk show. The man in question, John Sawers, is currently the British ambassador to the United Nations. His wife posted details about their family, vacations and residence on the social-networking site, British media reported Sunday. Her Web site has since been taken down, reports said. Have you ever posted something you later regretted on a social-networking Web site? Sawers ""was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6,"" said Miliband, using the common term for the Secret Intelligence Service. ""He is an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organization that does a huge amount for this country,"" Miliband added. ""The fact that there is a picture, the head of MI6 goes swimming. I mean, wow! That really is exciting. It is not a state secret."" But intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear-Harvey said the leak was at least an embarrassment and possibly much worse. ""Have you ever seen the foreign secretary more embarrassed?"" he asked rhetorically. ""The Foreign Office should have made the announcement that no personal details should have been left on any computer or directory,"" Trenear-Harvey told CNN. The leak compromises Sawers' personal security, said Trenear-Harvey, the editor-in-chief of ""The World Intelligence Review."" ""You could have someone come online and insinuate themselves with Lady Sawers' daughter,"" who reportedly appeared on the Facebook Web site. If she shares a computer with her father at home, ""the house could pick up a virus, and once that happens we have access to the next chief of the Secret Intelligence Service,"" the analyst said. An additional reason for red faces is that Sawers will be in charge of a new British cybersecurity organization when he becomes head of MI6, Trenear-Harvey pointed out. The new organization, based at GCHQ, another British intelligence agency, will be ""charged with making sure that all the intelligence services are not vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, or phishing,"" Trenear-Harvey said. This is not the first time a top British intelligence official's personal details have been leaked. When Richard Dearlove became the head of MI6 in 1999, ""his address in Putney was announced,"" forcing the government to put Special Branch police officers there to protect him, Trenear-Harvey said. And when Stella Rimington became the first publicly named head of MI5, the domestic security agency, in 1991, her north London address was revealed. ""She and her daughter fled the house and were put into an MI5 safe house,"" Trenear-Harvey said. Foreign service officers ""are advised to exercise caution"" on social-networking Web sites, a Foreign Office representative said, declining to be named, in line with government policy. Sawers, 53, is a career foreign policy expert. He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair when Blair was prime minister, then became ambassador to Egypt and briefly represented Britain in Iraq. He was political director at the Foreign Office for four years before going to the United Nations in 2007, according to his biography on the Web site of the British mission to the U.N. He is slated to replace John Scarlett in November as head of MI6. As chief of SIS, he reports to the foreign secretary, according to the SIS Web site.

5b074129601ed6162e909ffc465e4ab40721ea3a,CNN,"New York (CNN) -- Protests cropping up in more than a dozen American cities prompted President Barack Obama to discuss the phenomenon Thursday by saying demonstrators ""are giving voice"" to those frustrated ""about how our financial system works."" Speaking at a White House news conference, Obama also defended the country's financial sector, which appears to have taken the brunt of protester criticism, focusing on Wall Street and its regulators' purported role in widening economic disparities. ""We have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow,"" the president said Thursday. Still, Obama discussed a need to pursue action aimed at improving government oversight and blamed the financial sector and Republican lawmakers for obstructing reforms. ""Not only did the financial sector, with the Republican party in Congress, fight us every step of the way,"" but now the ""same folks"" are suggesting that the country should ""roll back reforms"" and go back to ""the way it was"" before the financial crisis. Rep. Paul Ryan said Thursday that limiting federal spending was pivotal to boosting the economy. The Wisconsin Republican also urged the government to lower taxes to promote U.S.-friendly businesses and spur economic growth. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, comparing the protestors to the origins of the tea party, a grass-roots political movement that has advocated reductions in government spending and efforts to curb corruption. ""What is the core of that protest? And why is it increasing in terms of the people it's attracting?"" Biden asked rhetorically. ""The core is the bargain has been breached with the American people."" He added that ""there's a lot in common with the tea party."" The two movements have drawn commentary from liberal and radical conservatives, who in both cases have said there is something fundamentally wrong with America's financial and political systems. Thursday marked the 20th day of Occupy Wall Street protests, now a series of grass-roots demonstrations against income inequality, corporate greed and a list of other often loosely defined social ills. Overheard on CNN.com: Your take on the protests . New York authorities set up at least one vehicle checkpoint as police appeared in larger numbers throughout the financial district and established a perimeter around Zuccotti Park, which is considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in that city. ""We hope that our message continues to resonate with everyone who has felt disenfranchised by the current state of our country,"" said Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street group. He said they plan to ""continue the protest until the message reaches every house in the United States."" What that message is remains largely unclear. Meanwhile, hundreds turned out in downtown Philadelphia near City Hall in a similar demonstration. Crowds also gathered in the Texas cities of San Antonio, Austin, Houston and Dallas, while more protests cropped up in Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Seattle and Tampa, Florida. Like-minded university students staged walk-outs a day before on college campuses such as North Carolina State University and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. And still more demonstrations took place Thursday in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, where police say 10 people were arrested for trespassing on Bank of America property. In the nation's capital, a war protest on Thursday -- scheduled the day before the 10-year anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan -- quickly turned their concerns to economics. Several hundred set to demonstrate against wars in Iraq and Afghanistan also echoed the voices of protesters in other cities, even bringing their rally to in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building. A day before, thousands marched in Lower Manhattan shouting slogans and waving placards as they meandered from Zuccotti Park to Foley Square near City Hall. That event turned violent later Wednesday evening, as some protesters scuffled with police, resulting in the arrest of 23 people for various offenses. One of them is charged with assaulting a police officer. Video taken by various news agencies showed police officers wielding batons and forcing protesters to the ground as the officers made arrests. Other videos emerged on You Tube and other Internet sites, showing police officers swinging batons at demonstrators. Still, it was not clear what prompted the exchanges. The city's Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne said five people were detained after charging a police line. The majority of Wednesday's protests, however, were peaceful and appeared buoyed by the support of local unions, including the United Federation of Teachers, Transport Workers Union and the United Auto Workers. The broader protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. While the fledgling movement since has struggled to define its mission, its participants have generally agreed in their criticism of the country's wealthiest 1% and their purported influence. The protests seemed to gain momentum after a September 24 pepper spray incident involving demonstrators and police. And last Saturday, police arrested hundreds as they marched across a roadway leading to the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking city traffic for hours. Social media sites such as Twitter seemed to be spurring similar protests elsewhere, though in vastly smaller numbers than those in New York. That includes dozens who gathered in Boston; Hartford, Connecticut; and Savannah, Georgia.

49aaa6796a009f9d542dcb320e4795dc45ca789a,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- A controversial quote inscribed in the granite of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall will be corrected, an official at the Interior Department confirmed to CNN. News of the change to the so-called ""drum major"" line was first reported Friday afternoon in the Washington Post. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has given the National Park Service 30 days to consult with the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, members of the King family and others to decide on a more accurate version of the quote, the official said. The quote holds a prominent place among more than a dozen King's most notable lines at the site. The memorial site features a commanding 30-foot statue of King, arms folded across his chest, emerging from a ""Stone of Hope."" The quote in question is inscribed on one side of the stone. The abbreviated and paraphrased version of the line sparked controversy last summer when acclaimed poet and author Maya Angelou said it made the civil rights leader appear to be arrogant. The line reads: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" In fact, King's original words, from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Angelou said that leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning. In an interview in October, Martin Luther King III said the quote would be changed, but did not elaborate. ""It's going to be corrected. First of all is what we understand. But I don't know exactly how it got to that place. That was not -- number one, that was not what dad said,"" he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. ""The issue is addressed, because it's going to be corrected."" Now the Interior Department is taking action. The MLK memorial sits on the Tidal Basin between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. The ""drum major"" quote was not the only point of contention when it came to the monument, which was more than two decades in the making. Some criticized the foundation for choosing a Chinese sculptor, Lei Yixin, to carve the statue. Others believe it does not accurately depict the civil rights icon. Martin Luther King Jr. Day will be observed across the country Monday. Dozens of students from an elementary school in Washington took turns Friday reciting King's ""'I Have A Dream"" speech. ""We are humbled to be here today in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the enduring legacy of his vision for a nation united by respect, integrity and justice,"" said Watkins Elementary School assistant principal Suriya Douglas Williams. ""Our fifth-graders have studied and prepared diligently to share Dr. King's message with you, a message which still resonates today, nearly five decades after he first delivered it.""

b6ad0c4e596e52443504915462589400fb027045,CNN,"(CNN) -- Juan Manuel Santos was sworn in Saturday as Colombia's new president, vowing to unify his country around the goals of prosperity for all and of thwarting the nation's leftist rebels. ""It is possible to have a peaceful Colombia, a Colombia with no guerrillas, and we will prove that by reason or by force,"" Santos said in Bogota in his first televised remarks as head of state. ""As long as they don't free the hostages, as long as they perpetrate terrorist acts, as long as they don't return children recruited by force, as long as they keep on planting mines and polluting the Colombian countryside, we will keep on battling those who commit violence, without exception, by any means available,"" he said. Earlier in his speech, Santos vowed to ""preside over a government of national unity."" ""The priority, the obsession of my government, will be to generate prosperity for society through the creation of jobs,"" he said. In an early test of Santos' diplomatic skills, his inauguration was attended by the foreign minister of Venezuela, which is at odds with Colombia over accusations that Colombian rebels have found refuge in Venezuela. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said he wanted to deliver a positive message from President Hugo Chavez. ""We would like to deliver -- that's what President Hugo Chavez specifically indicated -- a message of love and solidarity to all of the people of Colombia; a message for the future and for hope,"" Maduro said. ""We would like to reach out with our loving hand, of friendship and of fraternity to all of the people of Colombia."" In a speech later on Saturday, Chavez said that Maduro will meet with his Colombian counterpart in Bogota on Sunday. Chavez also said that he wants to meet with Santos. ""I invited Santos to go to Caracas,"" Chavez said, referring to Venezuela's capital. ""If he can't come, I'll go to Bogota."" ""But I am telling you,"" Chavez said at another point in the speech, ""the first disrespect to Venezuela, the first false accusation, and everything will be over."" Santos was elected president of Colombia in June with the highest vote total in his country's history, garnering more than 9 million ballots, roughly 70 percent of the electorate. He ran as a conservative promising to improve Colombia's security. Some of the strongest strikes against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, came under Santos' leadership as minister of defense, including the high-profile hostage rescue of former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt in 2008. ""We have been tough on terrorism and we will be even tougher now,"" Santos said at a victory celebration in June. Venezuela broke off diplomatic ties with Colombia last month after Colombian officials said they had photographic evidence of guerrilla camps in Venezuela. But on Friday, Chavez said he hoped to offer more details about relations with Colombia in the coming days, according to state media. ""We are very optimistic. We must move forward,"" Chavez said, according to the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias.",7,6.663465235018438

The franc, seen as a safe haven currency, has been appreciating as the almost-three year old financial crisis continues to weigh on countries using the euro. The strong currency eats into the company's bottom line, leaving Lindt -- which turned an operating profit of $52 million this year -- struggling to maintain financial momentum. According to Lindt chief executive Ernst Tanner, sales growth is falling short of targets and some of the company's markets are now in decline. Appreciation of the Swiss franc cost Lindt an estimated 9.5% of profits in 2011. ""We have grown from approximately $800 million twenty years ago to $2.5 billion [in sales] last year.

Lindt still makes all its chocolate in Zurich, but its expansion plans now include opening boutiques and coffee shops to promote its brand. But the company, famous for its Lindor balls, continues to face challenges in emerging markets.

d84dc9a70cb4f30a372e4341e83eaef697f79d3b,CNN,"(CNN) -- Once marred by conflict, Mozambique is slowly emerging as a popular tourist destination as people are drawn in by the tropical weather, beautiful beaches and rich culture. Mozambique's capital, Maputo is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city bursting with lively sidewalk cafes and jazz venues. One of Maputo's landmark buildings is the train station designed by an associate of the famous French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. Today the train station he inspired rarely sees trains, instead its jazz cafe is among the city's best night spots. The music likely to be performed there is marrabenta, a mix of traditional and urban dance music that was born in the capital. ""It's really become a national genre,"" said Joao Carlos Schwalba, a musician with the band Ghorwane. ""It was created in the south but slowly it has such a strong rhythm, it really became a national rhythm you can hear it in the south, the center and the north,"" he continued. The official language is Portuguese, after settlers first arrived in Mozambique in the 15th century. Colonial era architecture and relics can be found across the country but the nation has also preserved much of its African cultural heritage, making for an interesting and diverse mix of old and new. The city has undergone major redevelopment since the end of the civil war and any reminders of the country's brutal past are being carefully transformed in to points of interest. And it is proving a draw with tourists; government figures show that four times as many tourists visited the country in 2010 compared to 2004. Investment in tourism began in 1992, following a peace agreement, which brought an end to 16 years of civil war in the country. The old fort in the capital, built by the Portuguese nearly 200 years ago, is a symbol of the country's, sometimes violent, colonial past. But a group of Mozambique artists are working in the building to transform reminders of Mozambique's more recent civil war into pieces of art. Nucleo de arte or Arms to Art is a creative form of demobilization. The group have collected some 800,000 guns spanning two wars and four decades and are working on transforming them into works of art. The machine guns, landmines and hand weapons that the artists use are collected and deactivated by the Christian Council of Mozambique. ""We want to give our opinion, we want to show the world the good way for these bad materials and make some beautiful,"" said artist Goncalo Mabunda. Outside of the capital, the country has a number of beautiful islands to visit. Inhaca Island is the closet to Maputo and has a quaint village and Biology Museum. But depending on what you are looking for the islands range in size. Some are practically deserted while others, like the island of Mozambique, have a population of 14,000. With 2,500km of coastline along the warm Indian Ocean it is no surprise that fishing is one of Mozambique's most important industries. For generations, fishermen outside of the capital have been bringing in their catch using the same process and methods. One of Mozambique's most important exports are prawns and they are available to buy fresh in nearby markets. Prawns are still something of a delicacy to the average Mozambican so they can be quite expensive. About a kilo of king-sized prawns will cost around $10. The long stretches of coastline also means there are plenty of sea-based activities from snorkeling to scuba diving. Joseph Mayers, who lives in Canada, visited the country and told CNN that he can see it becoming a more desirable place in the coming years. ""Mozambique is a truly beautiful country with breathtaking scenery and sunsets. It has vast amounts of potential and it was an unforgettable experience, to say the least.""",7,7.91118832247143

There is just one problem: Everyone you know wants to go there. How to lose the crowds when seeking an ideal tropical getaway? Forget well-traveled spots, where the sprawling hotels are thicker than coconut palms. If you really want to leave the only footprints in the sand, go to one of the Caribbean's lesser-known islands. Petit St. Vincent, for example, a gem-like private island resort in the Grenadines, falls happily under the radar compared to its sister island, Mustique. ""We recently had a guest who wanted complete privacy for the two weeks that he was here,"" says Matt Semark, general manager of Petit St. Vincent. ""That's no problem at a place like this."" The guest, Semark says, sunned and swam at the hidden slice of beach fronting his hibiscus-edged cottage, took all his meals on his own spacious deck and wasn't faced with one other guest during his stay. Departures: Stunning hotel plunge pools . While not every under-hyped Caribbean island can offer that level of solitude, there are many that hit the mark or come close. Here are seven peaceful escapes: . Cayo Espanto . Just off the coast of Belize, this diminutive private island -- at just four acres, it contains six luxe private villas and one overwater bungalow -- has hosted a staggering list of seclusion-seeking A-listers (Tiger Woods and Leonardo DiCaprio among them). As befits such a clientele, every aspect of the experience here can be tailored to guests' whims.

Rooms start at $1,495; 910-323-8355; aprivateisland.com. 7 private island rentals . Dominica . Part of the Lesser Antilles, this large, jungle-covered island (much of which is a protected nature preserve) attracts mostly in-the-know ecotravelers. Stay at two-year-old Secret Bay (rooms from $360; 767-445-4444; secretbay.dm), set on a clifftop on the island's northwestern coast between two equally dazzling swimming beaches. (One has a hidden cave.) Guests stay in one of five tree house-style villas and bungalows, all built of Guyanese wood with floor-to-ceiling windows and outdoor showers. Activities include guided nature hikes, kayak expeditions and yoga in an open-air pavilion. Departures: Top private movie theaters . Guana Island . The 850 acres that comprise this British Virgin Island are home to more than 50 bird, 14 reptile and 200 plant and insect species, not to mention the myriad sea creatures that inhabit its waters. (The land is a protected wildlife sanctuary.) Guana's single private resort maintains some 12 miles of walking trails that allow guests to explore its tropical forests, seven beaches and sugar-plantation ruins on foot. The resort houses just 19 cottages and five lavish villas (the latter have private pools), along with a terrace restaurant, a small water-sport center and a bar for those who want to socialize. Rooms start at $695; 212-482-6247; guana.com. Isla Holbox . Despite its proximity to the perpetually thronged Riviera Maya, this 25-mile-long island off the northern tip of Mexico's YucatÃ¡n Peninsula has managed to stay sleepily unspoiled. Surprising, given that Isla Holbox is one of the best places on earth to snorkel among whale sharks -- enormous, harmless creatures that migrate to the waters here each year between June and September. Of the 20-odd lodging options, CasaSandra (rooms from $233; 52-984/875-2171) -- an elegant, 18-suite Mr & Mrs Smith resort with a top-notch seafood restaurant and daily whale-shark boat trips -- leads the charge. Departures: 10 top guest ranches . Kamalame Cay . Occupying a pristine, 96-acre private island off the north coast of Andros in the Bahamas, this boutique resort is still run by the same family that built it in the 1990s. The property, though, epitomizes modern barefoot chic, encompassing 19 breezy rooms and suites -- most with French doors, soaring Balinese-style peaked roofs and verandas overlooking the beach. The island sits adjacent to the Andros Barrier Reef (the third largest in the world), which teems with sea life; guests can explore with scuba and snorkeling excursions from the on-site dive center, guided half- or full-day bonefishing trips or borrowed kayaks from the resort's fleet. Rooms start at $407; 876-632-3213; kamalame.com. Peter Island . Though it's one of the largest British Virgin Islands, the nearly 2,000-acre Peter Island is private, unlike many of its neighbors. Yet its eponymous resort offers the sorts of amenities one would find at much larger properties, including a full-service, 15-slip yacht club; a 10,000-square-foot Ayurvedic spa; a dive shop and water-sports center; and several restaurants and bars (one of which hosts a weekly vintner's dinner). Many of the 55 spacious rooms, suites and villas are set directly off the stunning sweep of Deadman's Beach. Rooms start at $385; 800-346-4451; peterisland.com. Petit St. Vincent . Part of the Grenadines, this 115-acre private island resort is a luxurious place to unplug. There are no phones or Internet connectivity in the 22 seaside stone-and-timber villas, nor at the casual beach bar or the sumptuous tree-house spa or along the nearly two miles of shoreline. (There is, however, WiFi at the hilltop restaurant and reception area.)

e5d3ecd1ddf042d5f4f8c135626f59f5503e37c8,CNN,"(CNN) -- Justice Department prosecutors said Friday that they are closing a criminal investigation of champion cyclist Lance Armstrong without filing charges that he used performance-enhancing drugs. A statement from the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles said the seven-time Tour de France winner will not be charged, but did not explain the reasons for the decision. Armstrong has consistently denied doping. He was accused of using performance-enhancing drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Late Friday, he released a statement in which he said he was ""gratified"" to learn that prosecutors are closing their investigation. ""It is the right decision and I commend them for reaching it. I look forward to continuing my life as a father, a competitor and an advocate in the fight against cancer without this distraction,"" Armstrong said. Prosecutors called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles as they investigated the case, but they apparently determined that they lacked evidence to bring a charge. In May 2011, Armstrong once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drugs abuse in recent years with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May, in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News ""60 Minutes"" show by another American Tyler Hamilton. On his Twitter page, Armstrong said at the time: ""I have had a 20-year career, 500 drug controls worldwide, in and out of competition, and never a failed test. I rest my case."" In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the American news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" Hamilton added: ""Armstrong took what we all took -- the majority of the peloton took. There was EPO, testosterone, blood transfusions."" Meanwhile, Armstrong's lawyer Mark Fabiani blasted the ""60 Minutes"" report, releasing a statement saying: ""Hamilton is actively seeking to make money by writing a book. ""He has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on ""60 Minutes"" and increase his chances with publishers."" Fabiani continued: ""Greed and a hunger for publicity cannot change the facts: Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports: He has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition.""",1,10.235784412220266
d1c74fd9b879aa6d5a766c80d403fb7cbef73eff,CNN,"(CNN) -- Those of us who love travel know it can be a life changer. Since making resolutions is de rigueur this time of year, why not resolve to take steps that lead to adventurous and memorable trips all year long? Consider these eight resolutions for 2013: . Take off on your own -- even if you're traveling with a group. (Especially if you're traveling with a group). While togetherness can be great, at a point we all need a break. If you're an early riser, step out and stroll the half-empty streets before your fellow travelers get up. Longing to check out a boutique or museum no one else will appreciate? Do it on your own. If you feel badly about ditching your companions, pretend it's an adventure. Suggest everyone spend one morning or afternoon finding something they'll later introduce to the group. Not only will you discover some cool new spots when you regroup, you'll get to spend time alone inside your own head on your own personal treasure hunt. Everybody wins. Don't let the lack of a foreign language keep you at home. No matter how many (or how few) stamps you've got in your passport, hit the road anyway. When you arrive at your destination, those you'll meet won't expect fluent French, Mandarin or Swahili to flow from your lips. But you still should at least learn the pleasantries in your hosts' country -- as in ""thank you,"" ""please,"" ""excuse me"" -- before you show up. If you have time and the funds, why not sign up for a brief language course in your hometown? If you're on a budget, your local library likely has phrasebooks or dictionaries you can borrow. Does a restaurant in your area serve food from your destination country? Visit before you go and ask the staff to help you with a few words. Smart travelers know that it's the small things that mean the world to those you'll meet. Show respect by speaking their language -- even if just a little -- and you'll get respect in return. Say you're not a ""tour"" or ""cruise"" person? Give one a shot. Many of us experienced travelers pride ourselves on making our own way in the world, seeking out B&Bs and locally owned boutique hotels. We scour blogs and message boards for barely known ethnic eateries on the other side of the world. And once we arrive, we muddle through broken French-Turkish-Vietnamese-Urdu to figure out how to get around. But for a change, why not sign up for an excursion where someone else gets paid to do the planning? When going to parts of the world where no one is likely to speak your language -- or if you're visiting a place where it's not especially safe to travel alone -- an escorted tour makes plenty of sense. Even if you think a cruise will be too confining, consider taking one based on your passions or interests. It could be American baseball legends, classic Hollywood films or the sounds of ""Soul Train."" Or set sail to a destination like Antarctica or Alaska, where being on the water makes navigation easier. Don't be ashamed to fall back on what's familiar. As someone who often writes about cuisine, I love fine dining, great wine and Michelin-star restaurants as much as the next foodie. Still, there are some days on the road -- even in incredible food destinations like Paris or Rome -- when I get a craving for McDonald's fries and nothing else will do. And that's OK. I still remember years ago when a Spanish corporate colleague hosted me for a day of sightseeing and shopping in Madrid and for a coffee break she took me not to a historical Spanish cafÃ©, but to Starbucks. I was appalled. But now as a more seasoned and far less snobby traveler, I appreciate it. I have an American friend who lives in West Africa, and when she recently came to Paris, what did she long for? Stops at Starbucks and the city's first Chipotle location. Sometimes you just want what's familiar and comfortable -- so make no apologies and indulge. Vow not to leave vacation days on the table. Even though Americans earn less vacation time than most other industrialized countries -- a median 12 days, according to a recent Expedia Vacation Deprivation study -- they still tend to forgo two days. Whether folks think they can't financially swing a trip or fear their bosses will think negatively of them for taking off, we're leaving that earned time on the table. I never was one of them, but I always foolishly took my work with me on the road, calling into conference calls and frequently checking e-mail when ""on holiday."" But that's a bad habit -- and one you'll be expected to maintain if you do it. So don't start. Otherwise, you'll return from your vacation in need of another one. Periodically disconnecting from work is not only good for you, but it also will make you a more productive employee or boss when you get back. Start a travel-specific savings account. No matter how much we love to travel, most of us aren't made of money. Very often, our discretionary funds -- or the lack of them -- determine where we go, when, and for how long. But if there's someplace you've been dying to check out, why not create your own personal layaway fund? These days, it's easy to pre-arrange for a set amount of cash -- even if it's just $15 or $20 -- to be deducted from your paycheck or bank account. Or go the low-tech route and toss spare change and small bills into a dedicated jar. Over time, even small sums add up and just may mean the difference between taking that trip and staying home. The adage about your checkbook showing what you care about is true. If travel is truly a priority for you, then save like it. Do at least ONE thing that scares you while you're on the road. Travel often shakes you from your comfort zone -- and that's a good thing, especially for those of us who feel an obsessive need to always be in control. Why not consciously decide that while you're away from home, you'll do something that's a bit out of character? Nothing dangerous, of course -- just eyebrow-raising for you. For some of us, that's sampling a dish we'd never try at home -- whether fish cheeks in China or Tuscan cinghiale (wild boar) at the always-lively Il Latini ristorante in Florence. (So what if you hate it? You never have to try it again.) For others, it's ziplining over the jungles in Costa Rica. Yet others may take the baby step of going to the theater alone. Don't forget to build an element of whimsy into your trips -- and perhaps surprise yourself, too. Don't let other people's fears keep you from going. There's nothing sadder than letting other folks' hang-ups keep you at home. How many of us have been told how ""scary"" certain places are because someone knew someone who'd once heard of someone who'd been robbed on a train or gotten sick from the water? Perhaps you've been advised not to visit a country because there won't be many people who look like you. But so what if people stare? Although people in ""low-look"" countries such as the United States and Great Britain are taught that it's impolite, not all cultures consider steady eye contact ""rude."" In ""high-look"" countries such as Italy, you may find yourself the object of a long gaze. Perhaps people are just curious or think you're attractive. Travel teaches you that we can't always judge others' behavior by how we do it at home. Use common sense, but vow to make travel choices that speak to you and your values, not other people's fears. Besides, friendliness and warmth transcend languages and cultures, so travel expecting the best. Maureen Jenkins is a freelance travel, food and lifestyles writer.

52ee6a61dbf7470e361a7ae228e3e0ca475473ff,CNN,"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Three of four minors accused of taking part in a brutal videotaped gang rape of a teenager will face full prosecution, a spokesman for a South African court said Wednesday. The boys appeared in court Wednesday -- along with three others who are not minors -- to apply for bail. The seven suspects are between the ages of 13 and 19. A bail hearing will be held May 3 for the minors and June 20 for the adults, said the spokesman, Mthunzi Mhaga. It is unlikely that the suspects, accused of a crime that has shocked many in South Africa, will be granted bail, officials have said. An eighth suspect -- a man who was found with the victim -- is scheduled to appear in court on May 4, court officials said. The images of the assault of the 17-year-old girl, believed to be mentally ill, swept across the Internet last week and touched a nerve in South Africa. The shocking footage shows the girl pleading for her attackers to stop, and it has some activists saying it is an example of the country's problem with rape. The girl went missing on March 21. Police suspect she was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave. The cell phone video of her gang rape surfaced and went viral among schoolchildren in Soweto, a vast township near Johannesburg. The Daily Sun, a local tabloid, alerted police about the attack after a concerned mother whose daughter was watching the video handed it over to the newspaper. Police embarked on a search for the girl and the people in the video. Eight suspects have been arrested and charged with kidnapping and raping the teen. Seven of them were seen on the video; the other was a 37-year-old man found with the girl last week. A woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, according to local aid groups. More than 60,000 cases of sexual assault were reported in the year to March 2011, down from 70,000 in 2008, police said. Women's rights activist Lisa Vetten says in the province of Gauteng, where Johannesburg is located, one in every five rapes is a gang rape. ""Rape is a young man's crime,"" she said. ""It's a bit of a performance for them, showing off to each other how macho they are. We need to teach our young men that you can be masculine in ways that do not involve violence and degrading women."" The mother of the 17-year-old has said this was not the first time her daughter has been raped. She was raped in 2009 and 2010, and authorities have done little to address the issue in the past, the mother said. ""It's 2012 now, and I'm still waiting for DNA results,"" she said. After the girl was found and as the news of the video emerged, the government placed her in a safe house -- a place where she can attend school and socialize in a secure environment. ""They are coming now because things have turned out this way,"" the mother said. ""They shouldn't pretend as if they have been standing up for me. They never stood up for me.""",1,5.493308996355186
73733b9fd8d95a2d8f26a88e90ada8e9abcaaa8d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Jimmy Fallon left us with great memories after five years on ""Late Night,"" but the pressure was on for his first time hosting ""The Tonight Show"" on Monday. Yet at the end of the hour, we were left with a ""Tonight Show"" that offered both surprising moments and big laughs, although it might've included a lot more than we'll see on an average night, since it was Fallon's first show. Will Smith was the night's guest, U2 provided some music, and house band the Roots was as sharp as ever. (As Fallon said during his opening monologue, they're ""the most talented band in all the land,"" and he ""couldn't do the show"" without them.) That alone was a set-up for a great show, but Fallon also called on celebrity friends like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert to help him get his version of ""Tonight"" off to a good start. Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' debut: New show, same Jimmy . The effort paid off, as early reviews have been quite positive, with TVLine calling the show ""vibrant and fresh"" and USA Today saying Fallon was ""easy to like."" Fallon was a hit online as well, with tweet after tweet praising his performance, even from Jay Leno fans: . If you missed the premiere or want to relive some of the best moments, here are our five favorite scenes from Fallon's first ""Tonight Show."" 1. Will Smith and the ""Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing"" Right away, it was clear that several of Fallon's ""Late Night"" staples weren't going anywhere, including his occasional ""Evolution of Dancing"" sketches. Fallon's first guest, Smith, helped him during an ""Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing"" sketch, with both performers wearing '90s-style overalls and gamely showing off a number of hip-hop moves like the ""Running Man,"" ""Kid N Play"" and -- of course -- ""the Carlton."" Smith was on fire during the whole episode. He later gave Fallon some heartwarming words of wisdom: . 2. A family affair . Fallon's dad, whom he jokingly referenced in his final ""Late Night"" episode as being disappointed in him, showed up along with the 39-year-old comedian's mom. Seeing his parents in the audience was a sweet moment for a guy who probably only dreamed he might ever host ""The Tonight Show"" as a kid. It was a nice way to start the show before getting into the typical monologue jokes. 3. The parade of cameos . Moments after sitting down to his desk for the first time, Fallon made reference to a ""buddy"" who owed him $100 after betting he would never host ""The Tonight Show."" The next thing you know, Robert De Niro (Fallon's first ""Late Night"" guest) showed up with a $100 bill. Then Tina Fey followed with yet another $100 bill. And then Joe Namath, Mariah Carey, Lindsay Lohan, Tracy Morgan, Seth Rogen, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, Mike Tyson and Joan Rivers (not seen on ""The Tonight Show"" since the Carson years, when she was banned) also showed up to slap down their Benjamins. Finally, Stephen Colbert arrived with $100 in pennies, took a selfie and announced ""Welcome to 11:30, b***h!"" It was a jaw-dropping moment to say the least, and we have to say we agree with this viewer: . 4. U2 at the Top of the Rock . All of these moments show how Fallon is planning to make ""The Tonight Show"" his own, but none presented his perspective quite like having U2 perform on the roof of the Rockefeller Center. The band set up came even before Smith was officially brought out as the night's guest. The sunset above the New York skyline during U2's performance looked beautiful, and it made for an original and unexpected moment. 5. U2, unplugged . Yep, U2 was so awesome on Fallon's ""Tonight"" that the band is taking up two moments on this list. Fallon said that if he ever had them on the show, he'd have them perform a song stripped down, with just acoustic guitars and Bono singing. On Monday night, U2 did just that, performing the Oscar-nominated ""Ordinary Love"" for the audience in a memorable, fitting end to the very first ""Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""

66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4,CNN,"(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter. Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him. The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing ""with his own voice, in his own way."" Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called ""interesting but unfair."" These were followed by praise for cinema releases ""We Bought a Zoo,"" and ""The Descendants,"" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year. ""Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,"" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: ""Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email)."" Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. ""You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,"" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers. A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine. The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures. Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down. Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie. There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the ""most humble day day of my life"" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. ""My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!"" But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again. The Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of ""tweeting-before-thinking"" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a ""broke country."" The message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: ""RUPERT!!! delete tweet!"" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: ""EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!"" [sic] . Murdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page. Among other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.",6,8.300121169884756
c230452faaad38d33a4bdd06bec12e29c70e654a,CNN,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor checked out of a Los Angeles hospital ""sore, but intact,"" the actress said in an online message posted Friday evening. Elizabeth Taylor posted on her Twitter account that she was grieving for her close friend Michael Jackson. Taylor, 77, used her Twitter handle, @DameElizabeth, to tell fans that she was home, just as she did last week to announce she would go into a hospital to ""to complete a test I was in the middle of."" Her publicist this week denied tabloid rumors that her hospitalization was brought on by her grief over the sudden death of her close friend Michael Jackson in June. Taylor, in her latest tweets, addressed her sadness over Jackson's death: . ""I'm home from the hospital sore, but intact. Of course I'm still grieving for Michael ... I always will."" ""But as I said before I went into the hospital, 'I am a survivor,'"" Taylor tweeted. ""I've had many tragedies in my life, but I guess they have all taught me something. I have to look at it that way."" ""I have to be stronger and more appreciative of what I do have."" ""I give love and I'm surrounded by love ... and I thank God for that."" Twitter is a social networking site that allows users to update what they are doing using 140 characters or less. Taylor regularly posts short messages to her 116,000 Twitter followers through the account she opened earlier this year at the suggestion of her close friend, author and actress Kathy Ireland, publicist Dick Guttman said. She posted emotional messages earlier this month to counter rumors about how she was dealing with the news of Jackson's death. ""Although my grief over Michael could not be any deeper, I am not on suicide watch as some of the cheaper 'rags' would have you believe,"" Taylor tweeted July 5. A New York Post column published Tuesday quoted an unidentified source saying she was hospitalized because the ""heart's gone out of her"" after Jackson's death. Taylor, who uses a wheelchair because of scoliosis, or abnormal curving of the spine, gave fans several days advance notice of her hospitalization. ""I wanted you my friends to know that I'm going into the hospital Wednesday or Thursday to complete a test I was in the middle of,"" she wrote. Taylor said she declined an invitation to speak about Jackson at his public memorial because she ""cannot be part of the public hoopla."" ""I just don't believe that Michael would want me to share my grief with millions of others,"" Taylor tweeted. ""How I feel is between us. Not a public event."" ""I certainly don't want to become a part of it,"" she said. ""I love him too much. ... And I cannot guarantee that I would be coherent to say a word.""",8,6.083736621434538
ef34d467355a76bf1a0df5813047d9ca9f6d6c2c,CNN,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenyan and English police officers are conducting an ""active search"" for an English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort, a local police spokesman said Friday. ""We cannot stop the search,"" Kenya police spokesman Charles Owino. ""We do not take security lightly in Kenya."" Owino told CNN that the search was focused on the border regions of Kenya and Somalia and through a ""significant network"" of contacts across the border. An English couple staying at a remote safari lodge on the coast, near the border with Somalia were attacked early Sunday. David Tebbut was shot dead and his wife, Judith Tebbut, was abducted, police said. The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya. They were the sole guests in the hotel, which has cloth doors. ""From what we can be able to gather, he resisted, and that's why he was shot dead,"" Kenyan Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said Sunday. ""Maybe they wanted to take the two, but he resisted and that's why he was shot dead."" Kenya's economy depends heavily on tourism and Kenyan officials publicly and privately worry that the case will affect the industry, which took years to recover after the bloody post-election violence in 2008. ""We are putting in a lot of effort because this really affects our nation. We want to believe that God willing, that we find her,"" said Owino. He said that two suspects have been interrogated in the case and hinted that the kidnapping at a luxury resort could have been an inside job. ""There are strong indications that someone at the resort was acting maliciously,"" said Owino. ""We are looking at those leads very strongly."" There is speculation as to who attacked the resort and kidnapped Tebbut, but very few solid facts have emerged as to who carried out the kidnapping and where the victim was taken. A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia. Iteere said the motive was not known. ""We are treating it just as a bandit attack,"" he said.",1,7.23191631911043
a0b63dc6fbf9d4ad96f88715e879916b71a57261,CNN,"(CNN) -- Outspoken Australian billionaire tycoon and politician Clive Palmer has apologized for his verbal attack on China during a television interview last week, when he called Chinese people ""mongrels"" who ""shoot their own people."" The leader of the Palmer United Party was appearing on Australian television channel ABC when he was asked about the Chinese state-owned company he is locked in a dispute with. They're ""bastards,"" he said. ""I'm saying that because they're Communist, because they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country [Australia]."" He later clarified that his comments were meant for the company rather than the Chinese people or their government -- though Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang was unimpressed and described Palmer's words as ""totally irrational and absurd."" Apology . Then in a letter to China's ambassador to Australia Monday, Palmer apologized for his remarks. ""I regret any hurt or anguish such comments may have caused any party and I look forward to greater understanding for peace and cooperation in future,"" he wrote. ""I now come to the realization that what I said on Q&A was an insult to Chinese people everywhere and I wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincere apology."" He then went on to emphasize his links with China, before referencing Mao Zedong, China's late paramount leader. ""I have had a long involvement with China since first visiting the country in 1962. As Chairman Mao said in Nanjing when celebrating the 45th anniversary of the 1911 Revolution, words to the effect that over 45 years have passed since the 1911 Revolution and China had only sought friendly relations with its neighbors. ""He went on to say that another 45 years would pass and China would continue to seek good relations with its relations and China has. It is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations."" In response, China's ambassador to Australia, Ma Zhaoxu, said any remarks that attacked or slandered China would not gain popular support and were doomed to fail, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday. ""The healthy and stable relationship between China and Australia is in the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, and cannot be hindered by any individual,"" he said.",7,7.850546316110945
2585c2244816e835c8ca0b3a7c13cf5a8d7e12fb,CNN,"Milwaukee (CNN) -- My 91-year-old mother finds a lot of things aggravating. Drugstores that run out of things that are on sale. Typos. And phone calls from Mitt Romney. Quite a few phone calls from Mitt Romney. Also from Rick Santorum. And other people advocating for each of them. She's had enough. Also the television ads. Do they have to run so many? This is one time my mother and the rest of Wisconsin appear to be in sync. The political atmosphere that has prevailed since February 2011, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker launched his proposals to strip public employee unions of almost all of their power, remains supercharged. But as one big event follows another, with more coming soon, there is also a widespread sense that it's all getting to be too much. How much can one state take? A sense of political fatigue appears to be growing just as events are coming to a peak. Actually, they're coming to quite a few peaks, which is part of the problem. There's the peak that comes Tuesday, with the Republican presidential primary. Romney and Santorum, the two front-runners, have been up and down, particularly in the eastern half of Wisconsin the last few days. It's been rare in the last few decades for a Wisconsin primary to be consequential, but the general assumption is that if Romney beats Santorum, Romney will pretty much seal the deal as the GOP nominee. So this is kind of a big deal. Then there's the peak that will come over the next few weeks: a recall election in which Walker, who took office only 15 months ago, will face a Democratic challenger, quite possibly the person he defeated in November 2010, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The recall, only the third for a governor in American history, was ordered after more than 900,000 people signed petitions. A Democratic primary with -- as it appears at the moment -- four candidates will be held on May 8, with a final election June 5. At the same time in recall-happy Wisconsin, Walker's lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, will also face a recall, making her the first lieutenant governor in American history in that situation, and four state Senate seats held by Republicans will be involved in recall elections, with control of that house of the Wisconsin Legislature in the balance. Then there are the fall elections, with the strong prospect that Wisconsin will be a key battleground between President Barack Obama and the Republican nominee. Then there's an open seat for the U.S. Senate. Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl is retiring, and a heated Republican primary for that nomination is shaping up for August. So that totals up to major election days in April, May, June, August and November. It also means the prospect -- already being demonstrated -- of amazing amounts of campaign spending, much of it by independent groups; of robocalls inundating people across the state, and a level of television advertising that some experts say may leave Wisconsin viewers in the unenviable position of being exposed to more political spots in one year than virtually anyone else in U.S. history. It adds up to more than $100 million worth of political advertising in one state over 11 months. If one were to rank these election dates in order of interest, the Walker recall would be at the top of the stack. Tuesday's presidential primary may be a big deal in the national perspective, but it has been a relatively low-passion event at ground level. According to polls, Romney trailed Santorum in February; he was ahead in the last few days. Wisconsin has a large number of conservative voters, but the religiously motivated aren't as numerous as they are in Southern states, where Santorum has done well. Plus, it appears many Wisconsin Republicans, starting with powerful Rep. Paul Ryan, want to get the nomination race over and unite behind Romney. As in other places, support of Romney doesn't appear to mean high enthusiasm. The Walker recall, on the other hand, carries huge implications for Wisconsin's political climate for at least the next few years. Walker remains a polarizing figure like few who have ever crossed the landscape of the state. In almost any conversation with people who are not directly working in campaigns, the exhaustion factor comes up quickly. When will it all end? How many more ads can we take? How bottomless are the checkbooks of donors, especially the small- to midlevel donors? These concerns are sort of like the old Yogi Berra line about the restaurant that nobody goes to anymore because it's too crowded. Wisconsinites are worn down precisely because so much is going on, so many people are in various forms of uproar, and the parade of amazing political events doesn't seem to stop. But in a state that historically has had very high voter turnout, one of the things that will be important to watch in coming months is how many people come to the polls. Will turnout begin to droop? If so, to whose advantage or disadvantage? At what point does fatigue become a major player on the battlefield of Wisconsin politics, and a 91-year-old woman who would prefer some political peace and quiet become a key opinion leader? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan J. Borsuk.",8,7.492208908764939
abbe79c3c043e25198b2b40f7ada8ab0ddab00a7,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If climate change were a small house fire, current policy in the European Union and the United Kingdom would ensure that it would destroy not just the house but the entire suburb. Author of ""Carbon Scenarios"" compares global warming to a house fire that the world is currently failing to contain. That's the grim analogy offered by Paul Domjan, author of a new report, ""Carbon Scenarios: Blue sky thinking for a green future"", by the Stockholm Network, a London-based pan-European think tank. The report explores three scenarios on climate change, none of which leads to what's defined by the EU and UK as a 'successful outcome'; a greater than 90 percent chance of temperatures rising by no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""We have failed,"" Domjan says, adding, ""We will not prevent two degrees of warming."" Continuing the house fire analogy he says, ""The less than two degree scenario is a fire you can put out. With less than three degrees it spreads to other rooms but you can still put it out."" He says global policy of the past ten years looks more like the third -- and worst -- scenario explored by the Carbon Scenarios report -- the one dubbed ""Agree and Ignore.""  In that case, ""your house is unrecognizably destroyed. The positive feedback cycle isn't contained. Your house catches fire, your neighbor's catches fire..."" And so on. Domjan blames the failure of the current climate change policy on the constant stream of compromises by world leaders designed to keep the Kyoto agreement intact. ""This dynamic of making lots of small compromises in order to keep the agreement in place has led to a situation where the agreement has lost a lot of its teeth."" He points to Canada as an example, a signatory to the Kyoto agreement which has ""done nothing"" to implement it. ""During the time it's been a signatory it's been developing massive coal sands projects which are the most polluting way of producing gas and oil in the world,"" he says. ""There's a great international censure against the U.S. for not ratifying Kyoto but nothing has been said about Canada."" ""The coal sands are using so much natural gas and electricity they could have an entire nuclear facility just for themselves."" The three alternative futures explored in the Carbon Scenarios report include ""Kyoto Plus,"" ""Agree and Ignore"" and ""Step Change."" ""Kyoto Plus"" envisages a gradual transition to a global cap on carbon emissions by 2012. Domjan calls it a ""largely successful scenario"" where there's a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising more than 3.31 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. ""That's not a disaster. It's still a world that's recognizable,"" he says. The second scenario -- ""Agree and Ignore"" -- predicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions will ""stall and backslide"" leading to ""competitive regionalism."" There would be a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising no more than 4.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. From that point, temperatures would continue to rise into the next century. The third scenario -- ""Step Change"" -- imagines a radical shift in global policy direction. World leaders would introduce a system of global carbon caps, giving them greater than 90 percent chance of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 2.85 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Of the three scenarios, ""Step Change"" is the one Domjan personally prefers but the one he concedes is unlikely to happen. ""Our proposal [for a global upstream cap] is similar to but not identical to the proposal from the Kyoto 2 project,"" he says. ""It's a line of thinking that's been around for a while that will provide a healthy alternative to emissions trading."" Under the scheme, the United Nations would impose an annual cap on the amount of carbon that could be produced from fossil fuels. Natural resource companies would have to apply and pay for permits to produce carbon. Compliance would be determined at key points, for example, coal washing stations. ""The problem is how do you get the political impetus to have a big international change like that and for people to accept that this is genuinely going to be dealt with at an international level,"" Domjan asks. The ""Step Change"" scenario supposes that the impetus comes through a threat to U.S. and Chinese economic security. Under the scenario, climate change threatens Sino-U.S.. trade relations so the two combine to lead and enforce global change. ""Our current approach to climate change is moving at the pace of the slowest country,"" Domjan says, adding, ""Here they say we're going to move as quickly as possible and then force others to catch up."" Under that scenario, the need to purchase carbon production permits would push record oil prices even higher as energy companies pass on the cost to consumers. Domjan is confident the global economy could cope -- it's adapted to higher energy prices so far and is likely to prove equally resilient in the future. And the extra cost of fuel, rather going to producers, would be held in a fund controlled by the United Nations. It would be used to help developing nations to use fewer fossil fuels, to support new research and development, to compensate oil producers for the carbon they're not producing, and to establish an emergency fund to deal with the consequences of climate change. Domjan acknowledges that world leaders are unlikely to use the report as the basis for a new global policy, but he hopes they at least take away two key points: ""Whenever possible regulate at the point where there are fewest participants [and] we need to make sure there's a clear price signal so the market can distribute energy efficiently.""",2,10.162684464210871
8c1f7774b01ed516a28b9c1f63081fd5db90a19d,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly one of every 10 state prisoners is sexually victimized during confinement, according to a Justice Department study released Thursday. The Bureau of Justice Statistics examined data collected in surveys of former prisoners about their time behind bars. The officials found that most of the victims had been abused while they were in state prisons, but a small percentage were molested in local jails or halfway houses. The victimization rate of 9.6% is more than double the rate cited in a report on the subject in 2008. However, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justice Department, cautioned that the previous study was based on a survey of current inmates in both state and federal institutions. The nature of the sexual incidents did not change. Female prisoners were more than three times as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as male prisoners. Prison staff sexual misconduct was prevalent. The study noted nearly seven in eight such incidents involved perpetrators of the opposite sex. More than 75% of the former prisoners who reported staff sexual misconduct were male inmates who said they had interaction with female staff, the report said. Violence associated with the sexual incidents was found to be common. ""Among all victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence, a quarter said they had been physically held down or restrained, and a quarter had been physically harmed or injured,"" the report said. About 29% of the victims reported bruises, black eyes, sprains, cuts and scratches, but 23% reported more serious injuries, including stab wounds, internal injuries, and broken bones. In response, the Justice Department announced it is establishing rules ""to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse in confinement facilities"" The steps include screening inmates for risk of being sexually abused or sexually abusive, and training prison employees. ""The standards we establish today reflect the fact that sexual assault crimes committed within our correctional facilities can have devastating consequences for individual victims and for communities far beyond our jails and prisons,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement.",3,5.1795284428364745
ea79dd67c2d020802a89fad2a51c09a0fe552c18,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The symbolic ""Doomsday Clock"" scientists use to portray what they feel is the risk from nuclear holocaust has moved a minute closer to midnight. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists made the adjustment in reaction to an increased risk of weapons proliferation, the failure of a nuclear power plant in Japan, and terrorist threats to use ""dirty bombs"" with stolen atomic material. The clock was moved to five minutes before midnight after a symposium where experts presented their reasoning and risk assessment. It had been at six minutes before midnight since January 2010, when scientists moved the hand back, reflecting a decreased risk of nuclear proliferation. ""Two years ago, it appeared that world leaders might address the truly global threats we face,"" said Allison Macfarlane, who chairs the group's science and security board. ""In many cases, this trend has not continued or has been reversed. For that reason, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is moving the clock one minute closer to midnight, back to it's time in 2007."" The group, in announcing the decision Tuesday at a news conference, said in a news release that one factor was the question of nuclear weapons management ""in a world of increasing economic, political and environmental volatility."" Nuclear weapons are one of several issues that determine the setting of the Doomsday Clock. Atomic energy also contributed to the higher risk represented by moving the clock ahead one minute. But the group declined to take a position on the future viability of nuclear energy, just its existing threat to human survival, including the diversion of atomic material for weapons production. Kennette Benedict, the group's executive director, told reporters that even after more than 60 years of the scientists assessing nuclear risk, ""it remains to be seen whether the safety and the proliferation risks can be addressed in a way that really is acceptable to people."" ""Management issues, rather than technical issues, seemed to have been the problem in Fukushima,"" said Lawrence Krauss, who co-chairs an executive board with the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. He said the disaster in Japan represented a broader political lack of will to ensure safe global energy. ""The need to act is urgent,"" he said, saying action also is needed against the factors scientists believe cause global warming. ""Climate change is happening,"" Krauss said, listing it among the risk factors in the Doomsday Clock announcement. ""It's happening now, it's measurable, and it's clearly related to human activity, and the need to react becomes more urgent."" The Doomsday Clock was established in 1947 by scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The countdown to catastrophe has grown to reflect the risk to humanity and the planet not just from nuclear weapons, but also from a broad range of possible sources.",3,7.677541581722498
98b40ea1b6f8b0800cff9552b383ae70714bab5f,CNN,"Rome (CNN) -- The United States promised Thursday to send food and medical supplies -- but not weapons -- to rebels in the first such move since the conflict began two years ago. At the same time, European nations began to explore how to strengthen rebel fighters short of arming them after a European Council decision allowing aid for civilian protection. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the aid would help fighters in their effort to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives, laid waste to large portions of the country and created an enormous humanitarian crisis as refugees flee the fighting. The fighting also threatens to widen into a regional crisis and has raised concerns that Hezbollah, Iran or others could gain control in Damascus after al-Assad's government falls. ""The United States' decision to take further steps now is the result of the continued brutality of a superior armed force propped up by foreign fighters from Iran and Hezbollah, all of which threatens to destroy Syria,"" Kerry said after meeting opposition leaders in Rome. He did not say how much aid, but did announce that the United States would separately give $60 million to local groups working with the opposition Syrian National Council to provide political administration and basic services in rebel-controlled areas of Syria. That's on top of $50 million in similar aid the United States has previously pledged to the council, as well as $385 million in humanitarian assistance, Kerry said. ""This funding will allow the opposition to reach out and help the local councils to be able to rebuild in their liberated areas of Syria so that they can provide basic services to people who so often lack access today to medical care, to food, to sanitation,"" he said. Islamist Influence . The aid represents, in part, an effort to hem in radical Islamist groups vying for influence in Syria after the fall of al-Assad, a senior State Department official told CNN. ""If the Syrian opposition coalition can't touch, improve and heal the lives of Syrians in those places that have been freed, then extremists will step in and do it,"" the official said. Sheikh Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, president of the Syrian National Council, said concerns about Islamist influence were overstated. ""We stand against every radical belief that aims to target Syria's diverse social and religious fabric,"" he said. U.S. officials hope the aid will help the coalition show what it can do and encourage al-Assad supporters to ""peel away from him"" and help end the fighting, the official said. The opposition council will decide where the money goes, Kerry said. But the United States will send technical advisers through its partners to the group's Cairo headquarters to ensure the aid is used properly, the senior State Department official said. Additional aid possible . The European Council carved out an exception in its sanctions against Syria on Thursday to allow for the transfer of nonlethal equipment and technical assistance for civilian protection only. The council did not specify what kind of equipment could be involved. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday on Twitter that his country would pledge new aid because ""we cannot stand still while the crisis worsens and thousands of lives are at stake."" A diplomatic official at the French Foreign Ministry told CNN that France is studying the possibility of supplying night-vision equipment or body armor. In the United States, President Barack Obama is thinking about training rebels and equipping them with defensive gear such as night-vision goggles, body armor and military vehicles, sources familiar with the discussions said. The training would help rebels decide how to use their resources, strategize and perhaps train a police force to take over after al-Assad's fall, one of the sources said. Kerry did not announce that sort of aid Thursday, but said the United States and other countries backing the rebels would ""continue to consult with each other on an urgent basis."" An official told reporters that the opposition has raised a number of needs in the Rome meetings and the administration will continue to ""keep those under review."" ""We will do this with vetted individuals, vetted units, so it has to be done carefully and appropriately,"" the official said. Humanitarian crisis . Meanwhile, the bloodshed continued. On Thursday, 98 people were killed across Syria, including 35 in Damascus and its suburbs, said the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, a network of opposition activists. The conflict began with demands for political reform after the Arab Spring movement that swept the Middle East and Africa, but devolved into civil war when the al-Assad regime cracked down on demonstrators. In addition to the 60,000 people who have died since the fighting began in March 2011, another 940,000 have fled the country and more than 10% of Syria's 20 million residents have been forced to move elsewhere inside the country, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. The outpouring of refugees threatens to overwhelm the ability of host nations to provide for their needs, Assistant High Commissioner Erika Feller told the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Jill Dougherty reported from Rome, and Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Elise Labott also contributed to this report.",7,9.270779254287012
0f2025d9759060f141cb1a36aa7d54bdcc4c0139,CNN,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An anti-insurgent provincial governor who had survived Taliban assassination attempts was among 20 people who died Friday in an explosion at a northern Afghan mosque during prayers, a government official said. The blast in Afghanistan's Takhar province killed Kunduz provincial governor Mohammad Omar, who recently sounded an alarm about the threat of insurgents during an interview with CNN. The bombing also wounded 35 others, with most of those killed and injured engaged in prayer, said Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Zamarai Bashari. ""It is a terrible incident,"" said Bashari, who said police were trying to find out more details about the strike and who is responsible. The NATO-led command condemned the attack, saying that ""it's unconscionable that anyone would attack a mosque."" ""It's clear the insurgents have no respect for the most holy of Islamic places,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Greg Smith, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul deplored the act, saying ""whoever was responsible"" for striking a house of worship ""has demonstrated a clear lack of disregard for the Afghan people and for the peaceful religion they practice."" The mosque was bloodied and its roof was shattered, eyewitness Mujib Rahman said, but there were different early accounts on how the strike was carried out. Gen. Daoud Daoud, commander of the Afghan Interior Ministry's northern zone, said a suicide attacker apparently sitting next to the governor detonated a bomb. Faiz Mohammad Powhidi, a Takhar governor spokesman, told CNN that a pre-placed mine exploded. He explained that governor had been visiting his family and attending Friday prayers weekly in his native province of Takhar, which borders Kunduz. Omar, who was a Pashtun, had survived several assassination attempts by the Taliban, and his brother was slain a few months ago. He told CNN on Sunday that for the last two years, the security situation has deteriorated in Kunduz because insurgents decided to destabilize northern Afghanistan, which, until recently, had been relatively stable during the nine-year-old Afghan conflict. The Takhar blast and the Thursday killing of a German soldier in the north illustrates a growing unrest that contrasts with the first years after the Taliban's collapse in 2001. In those days, the north was much more secure than the predominantly ethnic Pashtun south and east of the country. Omar told CNN that the insurgents were trying to use Kunduz as a launchpad to destabilize northern Afghanistan and the wider Central Asian region and lamented the lack of police available to battle insurgents. ""Currently 40 percent of Kunduz province is under Taliban control,"" he said. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle conveyed his regrets to the Afghan government in a letter. ""Yesterday we suffered the death of a Bundeswehr soldier,"" he said. ""Today the news reaches us of another attack in which the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, was killed. I wanted to express my condolences on the part of the federal government."" Other violence rippled across the country on Friday. Three coalition soldiers in southern Afghanistan were killed: one in an insurgent attack and two others in improvised explosive device attacks. NATO does not give the nationalities of service members who are killed, but the British Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed in Helmand province in the south Friday. NATO-led forces killed five armed men in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. The command is investigating allegations of civilian casualties in the latter incident, ISAF said.",7,8.30457637095063
151d06cef37de2618245506d5f6adb1aa01d89b8,CNN,"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said. Kirby Archer is expected to plead guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping the death penalty. Kirby Archer is expected to change his plea to guilty in exchange for a prosecutors' agreement not to seek the death penalty against him, according to Jeff Branam, an uncle of slain boat captain Jake Branam. He said prosecutors told the victims' relatives about the plea deal. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, Florida, declined to comment. Court documents filed Friday show that Archer is scheduled to change his plea at a hearing Thursday. Archer and Guillermo Zarabozo are charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery in the deaths of Branam; his wife, Kelly; his half-brother Scott Gamble; and first mate Samuel Kairy. None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be. The abandoned Joe Cool was found by the U.S. Coast Guard on September 23, floating about 60 miles south of the island of Bimini. Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later, about 10 miles away on a life raft. The two had paid the Joe Cool crew $4,000 in cash to take them to the Bahamas from Miami, where they said they were planning to meet some girlfriends. The trip should have taken about an hour each way. The boat did not return. Zarabozo told authorities the boat had been hijacked by pirates who fatally shot Jake and Kelly Branam and ordered the crew thrown overboard but spared the two of them. This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun. No gun was found. Police believe that the bodies of the crew were pitched overboard between Miami and Cuba. Jeff Branam said the victims' relatives met with prosecutors a few days ago. ""They said he was going to plead guilty,"" he said of Archer. ""I would have liked to have seen him get the death penalty, but if he's going to be in prison for the rest of his life with no chance of getting out, that'll work."" CNN was unable to reach Archer's defense attorney. Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate. ""I think they have a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" he said. ""If you have just one person on a jury who might feel there were pirates, they might not [convict],"" he said. ""Without bodies, it could be an uphill battle."" Archer, 36, was once an Army MP who served at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Investigators and victims' family members say they were told he wanted to go back to Cuba. Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family. Last year, Archer fled to Florida after he was accused of stealing $92,000 from an Arkansas Wal-Mart where he was working. Zarabozo's lawyer, William Matthewman, had little to say about Archer's pending plea. ""All I can say is, Mr. Zarabozo pled not guilty. He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."" No trial date has been set. Jake and Kelly Branam are survived by their children: a girl who was 2 at the time of their deaths and a boy who was 4 months old. A court has awarded custody of the children to Kelly Branam's stepsister, according to relatives.",1,6.347609764057437
742e36d5c3c1ee0ee059bb2b492226880ec50759,CNN,"(CNN) -- 2014 is an election year. We know this because, once again, the Democrats are out in force with voices raised, full of outrage, trying to convince women that new laws are needed to ensure that they receive equal pay for equal work. Equal pay for equal work. Sounds pretty simple, right? We all agree that a woman doing the same job as a man should not be paid less just because she's a woman. Unfortunately, the broader issue is not that simple. What if one employee has more education? What if that employee has been with the company longer or has more experience? These are questions that courts have been mediating since 1963 as companies have faced lawsuits over gender discrimination with regard to wages. Why 1963? Because that is when the Equal Pay Act was signed into law by President John F. Kennedy. The law says that ""no employer shall discriminate between employees on the basis of sex."" And it passed the House that year by a 362-9 vote. That's right, nine Democrats voted against it. Democrats highlight equal pay in political push . For the past two election cycles, Democrats have tried to paint Republicans as backward cavemen on this issue as part of their so-called ""War on Women,"" claiming that Republicans don't care about women because they opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Act. Never mind that the Ledbetter Act had little to do with the premise of equal pay for equal work and everything to do with the time limit for trial lawyers looking to exploit a potential claim. Democrats consistently ignore data from neutral sources that indicates that when you actually compare men and women with the same background and education doing the same job, equality of pay has been largely achieved. PayScale, a compensation data company, has shown that in careers from software developer to nursing to construction project manager to human resources administrator, women are within 1% to 4% of men in terms of pay equity. Obama to strengthen equal pay protections . However, much of the research on women voters in recent years supports the notion that women believe that men get paid more for the same job than women do. There are several reasons for this: 1) personal experience, 2) friend to friend examples and 3) Democrat politicians with manufactured data perpetuating it. So what is a Republican candidate to do? First, every Republican should affirm, without hesitation, support for the concept of equal pay for equal work. There should be no perceived daylight between Republicans and Democrats on this basic value. Democrats seize on equal pay as midterm issue . Second, every Republican should remind voters that they support the Equal Pay Act. They should affirm that, had they been in Congress at the time, they would have voted to pass it and that the only ""nay"" votes recorded that day came from Democrats. And Republicans should remind women that if they are not receiving the equal pay that they deserve, the law is on their side and that bad actors should be vigorously prosecuted. Third, all Republicans should know their facts. Be prepared to challenge the media and their opponents when they try to claim that some new piece of legislation is necessary to ensure equal pay. Not every problem in America can be fixed by Washington. Every disparity that exists in the workplace is not an opportunity for a new piece of legislation. Fourth, every Republican should celebrate companies that have decided it is good business to have a diverse workplace. We should applaud those that have gone out of their way to attract women and give them a rich and robust work experience. And there are plenty of great examples in the Forbes list, ""The 10 Best Companies for Women in 2014"": . -- IBM, which has a Reconnections Initiative that tries to bring women who left to have children back to IBM. -- Marriott, which has an impressive 55% female workforce and 58% female management team. -- Ernst & Young, which has a mentorship program where senior level women pursue opportunities on behalf of younger women within the company. As we celebrate these success stories and condemn bad actors, workplace experiences for all women will improve. Finally, all Republicans should support initiatives to encourage young girls to enter traditionally male-dominated fields such as science, technology, engineering and math. These important STEM fields are crucial to our country's future and provide incredible opportunities for women to achieve high earnings. As of last month, there were 4.7 million unemployed women in this country. What is sad indeed is the willingness by Democrat candidates to use the issue of pay equity as a political football to change the subject from that sobering statistic and the fact that women can't keep their insurance plans or their doctors because the promise of Obamacare turned out to be a lie. These are the real challenges facing women today. But the truth can be inconvenient when it doesn't fit into the Democrats' narrative of a trumped up ""War on Women.""

c9707b28c04bb9b78359b923607891b4133856b1,CNN,"(CNN) -- To resolve America's ongoing, bruising battle over the debt and deficit, House Republican Paul Ryan and Senate Democrat Patty Murray announced a deal on December 10 to halt spending cuts -- mostly in defense -- and lock in a two-year budget agreement to avoid another government shutdown on January 15. But in eagerly seeking agreement with the Republicans who shut the government down in October, Democrats risk hurting the economy's fragile recovery by accepting too much budget austerity embedded in the newly adopted budget. President Obama and the Democrats won big over the Republicans in October's budget fight. Instead of pressing their advantage, Democrats took tax increases for the rich off the table, agreed to cut federal pensions and did not get unemployment benefits extended. The Democrats basically threw away their political gains. The deal repeals less than half of the sequestration cuts planned for 2014. If Obama and Congress continue their shortsighted obsession with austerity and budget cuts, they ignore the big economic lesson from the past several years: Austerity hurts prosperity. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the entire 2013-2014 spending cuts would increase Gross Domestic Product by $113 billion and create 900,000 additional jobs next year. The October 2013 government shutdown took another $24 billion out of the GDP. Unemployment remains stuck around 7%. Though the deal reduces a bit of fiscal uncertainty, it hardly affected the U.S. growth forecasts for big banks, despite bank economists citing some pessimism because of ""austerity shock"" from spending cuts and ""uncertainty shock"" from Washington's continued fiscal battles. Republicans bargain for more cuts and fewer taxes, but cutting military spending makes them nervous, so they attack Social Security and Medicare. The Wall Street-affiliated Democratic group Third Way is helping. It launched an attack on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and others who rightly refuse to cut Social Security as part of a long-term budget solution. We all know that Republicans like to defend the wealthy and slash government. But why does austerity, especially cuts to old-age programs, have credibility with Obama and other Democrats? Advocates of ""grand bargains,"" cutting programs to balance the budget, wrongly presume the budget is a fixed quantity. They imagine it like a fixed pie. Programs for the young, like education, must be paid for by cutting other programs, like Social Security. But their belief that a dollar taken from the old will be spent on the young is not only divisive, mean and fierce -- it is wrong. In his December 6 speech on inequality, Obama talked about the sky-high and stubborn child poverty rate: more than 24%. But cutting Social Security and Medicare will only destabilize the economy and increase the elderly poverty rate. In many countries, programs for elderly people are not traded off against help for the young. When support for old-age programs increases, so does spending on children. Advanced democratic countries' spending on the elderly is positively correlated with education spending. One analysis shows that a 10% increase in spending on education is correlated with a 7.3% increase in spending on pensions. The Congressional Budget Office warns that long-term deficits can hurt the economy. Want to reduce the debt and deficit? Tax the wealthy, which won't hurt the economy. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty estimate that raising the tax rate for the top 1% as high as 80% would generate far more revenue. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, propose a transactions tax -- a three-penny charge on every $100 traded in the stock market, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would raise $352 billion over 10 years. This small tax would also reduce stock churning by speculators, creating a nice secondary benefit. Want to find even more savings? Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, wisely put tax loopholes that cost the Treasury almost a trillion dollars per year on the table. For example, Reid called for eliminating the small, but noxious, tax break for buying yachts and the $17 billion break that comes from taxing private equity, real estate and hedge fund profits as ""carried interest"" rather than at the ordinary income rate of 39.6% instead of the capital gains rate of 20%. There is one piece of good news: The deficit is coming down, from 9.2% when Obama took office to 4.1% of GDP in 2017. Faster economic growth would shrink the deficit more rapidly. In contrast, further spending cuts will slow the economy and deficit reduction along with it. So, this is no time for Obama to accept a lower budget path, or to consider cuts in Social Security and Medicare. The small budget deficit reductions in this deal -- less than one-half of 1% of the total debt or $23 billion -- would almost pay for extended unemployment benefits for one year at $25 billion. Democrats are flinching under continued pressure from Republicans playing out their long game as they ready for another bitter fight when the debt limit is reached next spring. But the President and the Democrats have a winning economic and political strategy: Raise revenues and keep Social Security and Medicare strong. Don't throw October's hard-won victory away; it won't help the elderly, it won't help children, and it won't help the economy.

5d6e64dd20f6b969e69e034933dc53c7dfeb7726,CNN,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan state TV reported Sunday that the opposition-held town of al-Bregahad been ""been cleansed from the criminal gangs and mercenaries, the area is now safe, and all citizens should go back to their work and their normal life."" Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since an uprising began last month. Opposition leaders in Benghazi confirmed to CNN that their forces have left al-Brega, but they are calling their move a ""tactical retreat."" The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf, once in the hands of rebel forces, and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad. The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure. Libya's National Oil Corporation, meanwhile, urged companies to resume oil exports after saying that all ports are safe, state TV reported. Also Sunday, the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi, an al Qaeda leader, calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi. The Libyan leader has frequently accused al Qaeda of being behind the unrest that began last month and has since spiraled into a civil war. The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone ""to protect the civilian population"" in Libya, the body's secretary-general Amre Moussa said. ""We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya,"" Moussa said. ""The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced."" The Libyan foreign ministry denounced the League's move, calling it a ""flagrant action against its charter,"" according to state TV Sunday. It also reported that the ministry would welcome the arrival of a fact-finding mission sent by some African nations. Also Saturday, an Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi, Libya, becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war, the network reported. Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi, an opposition stronghold in the east, from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when ""unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in,"" Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website. The cameraman and another person were wounded. Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital, but did not survive, the network said. ""Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime, which comes as part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff,"" the network reported. The no-fly zone which the Arab League is calling for would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends, Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Oman's foreign minister said in a joint appearance with Moussa. Arab League members have reservations about military intervention, but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians, bin Abdullah said. ""We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision,"" he said. ""Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition."" Moussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council, the Libyan opposition's newly formed administration, and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis. ""We are giving them legitimacy but we're not giving them political recognition,"" Moussa said. ""We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality."" The Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya, where war has broken out between forces loyal to Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement. The White House cheered the League's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi, support the opposition and prepare for ""all contingencies."" Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion, but Gadhafi's military has recently gained strong momentum. The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo, while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups. Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground to pro-Gadhafi forces, rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes. No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly. Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Western powers have said any action by the international community, including a no-fly zone, would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he ""won't take (the) decision lightly"" on whether to use military force, including helping to enforce a no-fly zone, saying it is critical to ""balance costs versus benefits."" While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people, the European Union was more restrained Friday, saying it ""welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi, which it considers a political interlocutor."" The Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad, where the government ousted rebels about a week ago. CNN's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he didn't see them engage in strikes. He saw some structural damage, such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses, including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house. Some stores were closed and others had been looted. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.",7,10.144354951495814
04c6d573fb7326ff0e46ea38448a22b947740748,CNN,"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday, urging Americans to reject what he called the Bush administration's legacy of ""incompetence, negligence and failure."" In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president. ""Americans simply cannot afford to continue the policies of the last eight years for another four,"" Gore, the party's 2000 presidential nominee, told Obama supporters at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. Perceived as a senior statesman in the Democratic party, Gore brings a certain force to Obama's campaign, political analysts have said. Monday marked Gore's debut in the 2008 election; he had not weighed in while Obama was still battling Sen. Hillary Clinton. Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation. The former vice president turned Nobel Prize winner playfully said he recalled one Republican nominee wondering out loud whether his Democratic rival for president was ""naive and inexperienced."" ""And yet another said the United States cannot afford to risk the future of the free world with inexperience and immaturity in the White House,"" said Gore. ""Who were they talking about? Every single one of those quotes came from the campaign of 1960, when the the Republicans attacked John Fitzgerald Kennedy for allegedly lacking the age and experience necessary to be president."" Richard Nixon was the Republican nominee in 1960. Joining Obama in the midst of the candidate's two week swing through the nation to talk about his plans to revitalize the economy, Gore praised  Obama as someone who could mobilize people, young and old, who had never before taken part in politics. Gore went on to praise the nominee's vision on the environment, domestic and international issues. Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has ""inspired"" him. ""I feel that same spirit in this auditorium tonight, building all over this country this year,"" he said.  ""Take it from me, elections matter,"" Gore said. ""If you think the next appointments to our Supreme Court are important, you know that elections matter. If you live in the city of New Orleans, you know that elections matter. If you or a member of your family are serving in the active military, the National Guard or Reserves, you know that elections matter. ""If you are a wounded veteran, you know that elections matter. If you've lost your job; if you're struggling with a mortgage, you know that elections matter.""  Watch Gore say Americans must let Washington know that they want a change » . Gore cited concerns about the environment, lead-painted toys and food safety -- even pet foods -- as other reasons to vote for the Democrat. ""After the last eight years, even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter,"" Gore said, adding, ""After eight years of lost jobs and lower wages, we need change. After eight years of incompetence, negligence and failure, we need change."" Gore said the Bush administration has ""dishonored and disrespected"" the Constitution and led the nation through ""eight years of the most serious foreign policy mistakes in the entire history of our nation."" The Tennessean newspaper noted Obama was among the few senators in either party who argued against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq prior to the invasion Gore called a ""blunder."" He called for Americans to move beyond partisanship and select in Obama a leader who can ""solve the climate crisis and create a bright future."" GOP spokesman Alex Conant reacted to Gore's criticism of President Bush. ""This election isn't about changing the past, it's about changing the future,"" he told The Associated Press on Monday evening. Calling attention to the fact that Gore's 2000 running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, has since left the Democratic Party to become an independent and is backing Sen. John McCain, he said, ""It's telling that half of the 2000 Democratic ticket endorsed John McCain early in the campaign, while the other half waited until Barack Obama had been the presumptive nominee for weeks.""",1,10.509885877139375
ad11185d0bc480809fec1b21ad1fd0dacc80b1d7,CNN,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Under heavy criticism for a telling cell phone carriers to ban certain words in text messages, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority went into damage control mode Wednesday. PTA spokesman Mohammed Younis Wednesday denied the existence of the plan, which has met with derision from mobile phone users in the country. ""If at all we finally decide to go for this process, then we will prepare a list in consultation with the mobile operators,"" Younis told CNN. In another conversation with CNN two days earlier, however, Younis acknowledged that the telecommunications authority had sent out a notice to carriers -- but said that the agency was giving the operators more time to come up with a shorter list. Earlier this week, three carriers -- Mobilink, Warid and Telenor -- received the notice, officials there confirmed. In it, the PTA , which regulates cell phone and internet carriers in Pakistan, called on them to implement the ban within seven days. This would mean blocking text messages containing the offending words. Most of the 1,500 banned words were deemed sexually explicit or obscene by the PTA, the officials said. The words include ""taxi"" -- often used to refer to prostitutes in Pakistan -- ""gay,"" ""tongue,"" ""homosexual,"" ""intercourse,"" ""condom"" and ""hole."" CNN has obtained a copy of the list. In the notice, which is available online, the PTA cited a law that bans the transmission of indecent and obscene messages. The notice says the banned words are part of an effort to cut down on spam and unsolicited text messages, the officials said. Last month, the PTA banned thousands of websites containing pornography. But the latest about face on text messages appears to mean the PTA will not act on the notice -- at least, any time soon.",6,6.979964843189212
c378f99f0b22332969c0fd9b9b81987409bef1cf,CNN,"(CNN) -- With up to 300 rainy days per year, the Faroe Islands aren't set to become the next big summer vacation spot. But the unscathed landscape, idiosyncratic architecture and a calming simplicity is attracting tourists more than ever. Situated in the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, midway between Norway and Iceland, the 18 islands that make up the Faroes have 600 miles (965 kilometers) of roads and a population of sheep that significantly outnumbers the people. Many arrive, just like I did, with a limited knowledge of this remote archipelago. Travel guides mention the Faroe Islands only in passing. But the islands, a territory of Denmark with a total area smaller than London and just 49,000 inhabitants (and 70,000 sheep), are becoming more than a refreshment stop for travelers on their way to Iceland. As soon as I arrive, I meet Barour, an intern with the local tourist board. Over one of the most expensive beers in my life ($10 for half a pint) in a hotel bar in the capital Torshavn, he briefs me on the local must-sees. Tjornuvik is the northernmost village on the main island of Streymoy. ""From there, you'll see where the Icelandic giants hurled a rope to tow the Faroes toward their island,"" says Barour. Mythological creation . According to local myth, creatures from Iceland were so jealous of the raw beauty of the Faroes that they wanted to have the islands for themselves. But two giants that swam during the night across the ocean struggled to move the islands. When the sun rose, they turned to stone. That's how Risin and Kellingin (""The Giant"" and ""The Witch""), two sea stacks north of Eysturoy island, each about 230 feet (70 meters) tall, were created, the legend goes. Despite the comparatively small size of the Faroes, distances here appear surprisingly large and public buses run infrequently. A camper van brought across via ferry or a rental car hired locally makes traveling the islands much easier. Driving around the Faroe Islands is a thrilling experience. Smooth, often narrow, one-lane roads wind through the Middle-earth-like surroundings, making for a perfectly picturesque road trip. Such is the case with the road to Tjornuvik -- a patch carved in rock on top of a nearly vertical cliff with narrow passing bays and sheep wandering the roads. The road to Saksun, just few miles south of Tjornuvik, is less demanding, but equally unforgettable. Seven miles of gentle bends in a juicy green valley lead to a lonely church overlooking a fjord and surrounded by waterfalls. Green roofs . Scattered along these roads are many grass-roofed houses. These started life as a pragmatic solution for dwellings (see gallery), but have since become a symbol for the islands. Houses have been built like this for more than a thousand years, providing protection from rain and thermal insulation. Long hours of daylight (though rarely direct sunshine) in the summer allow for a thorough exploration of the northern Faroes. The main islands are connected by underwater tunnels and one bridge: ""The only bridge over the Atlantic Ocean,"" jokes Barour. Driving on another otherworldly road from Gjogv, known for its natural harbor in a gorge, it becomes clear that while the Faroes are a wonder for a fleeting visit, life here is difficult. As I await the never-coming dusk of the almost polar day, the beautiful islands start to feel monotonous. Lack of perspectives, loneliness and remoteness are problems for young Faroese and many leave to study abroad. But not all is bad, say those who return. ""You have close family and people to help you here, and the environment is very anti-stressful,"" says Bodil, a Faroese woman from the island of Eysturoy. Despite weather so volatile that, according to a local saying, Vivaldi could have composed ""The Four Seasons"" in one day here, the Faroes can easily enchant a tourist with their unusual beauty. Getting there . The sole carrier offering regular flights to the only Faroese airport, Atlantic Airways connects the archipelago mostly with Copenhagen and Billund in Denmark. Some flights depart to Norway and Iceland. In summer there are also rare connections to London, Barcelona and Milan. A weekly ferry is another option for those willing to endure three days on the typically rough North Sea.

aa40eb773430e30dbed4df5ba21ef4e599cb7960,CNN,"(CNN) -- Until this week, Utah had 24 state symbols, from tree (the blue spruce) to insect (the honeybee) to even cooking pot (the Dutch oven). Now it's added an official state firearm -- the John M. Browning-designed M1911 pistol, becoming the first state in the nation to have one, according to the state legislator who sponsored the law. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert signed the new symbol into law this week. State Rep. Carl Wimmer, a Republican who was a police officer and SWAT team commander, came up with the idea for a state firearm last year after hearing about how Pennsylvania lawmakers wanted to make the Pennsylvania long rifle its official state firearm, Wimmer told CNN on Friday. That measure eventually failed, he said. Wimmer selected the semi-automatic M1911 because gun maker Browning was born and raised in Ogden, Utah, and was the son of Utah pioneers who crossed the plains in the 1800s, Wimmer said. This year is also the 100th anniversary of when the U.S. military chose the M1911 to be its standard-issue sidearm for all branches of service, Wimmer said. That's how the pistol got its name: ""M"" for military and 1911 for the year that the military began issuing the gun to all its servicemen and women, Wimmer said. In a state more known for its strong Mormon traditions and breathtaking national parks, the creation of an official state firearm raised controversy, especially when the measure was pursued even after January's mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six persons and wounded 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The bill was introduced just before the horrific shootings, Wimmer said. ""People say the timing is terrible, and I admit the timing is terrible,"" Wimmer said. ""We have a part-time legislature in Utah, and we are only in session for 45 days. Certainly meaning no disrespect to the tragedy in Arizona, we moved forward in doing this because it's the only opportunity that we had."" Other critics have said the new state symbol implicitly condones gun violence. ""There was more controversy than I anticipated, but it really passed with bipartisan support,"" Wimmer said. ""One of the biggest comments from the critics was that we should not honor an implement of death. And my response to that has always been that this firearm does not represent an implement of death. It represents an implement of freedom -- just the mere fact that our soldiers have used this firearm to defend liberty and freedom around the world for the last 100 years."" The governor's office played down the lethality of the new symbol and focused more on its creator. ""This bill isn't so much about a weapon as it is about honoring John Moses Browning, who was a Utah inventor and entrepreneur, and he repeatedly gave back to the state,"" said the governor's spokeswoman, Ally Isom. The governor's office and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. The M1911 had been the standard issue in the military until about 15 years ago, when the Beretta 9mm became its common sidearm because it holds 15 rounds and the M1911 only eight, Wimmer said. However, the M1911 is still used by elite units like Delta Force, Wimmer said. ""I thought how appropriate that we honor John Moses Browning on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. military's adoption of the M1911 as their official pistol,"" Wimmer said. ""The list of firearms that he invented is too exhaustive for me to go into,"" Wimmer added about Browning. Wimmer owns a Browning-designed M1911, he said. ""Almost every military weapon that is currently in use today has one point or another been modeled after a Browning firearm,"" Wimmer said. Wimmer, 35, is now considering running for Utah's fourth congressional seat, newly created after the latest census, he said. He was a SWAT commander, canine patrol officer and sex crimes detective in South Jordan, Utah, for seven years and then a patrol officer in West Valley City, Utah, for four years, he said. He left the police force to serve in the state legislature and is now a partner in the security consulting firm Corporate Task Force in Riverton City, Utah, where he lives. Addressing other critics who say he's merely seeking publicity for his possible congressional run, Wimmer responded: ""People will second-guess everything I do and say everything I do is because of the congressional race, and it's simply not true.""",3,9.687014626405924
6feb1c384ef044e13fa496b421a7d8294bd5d14f,CNN,"(CNN) -- The accused terrorist who said he was tortured into making a false connection between al Qaeda and Iraq has died in a Libyan prison, human rights monitors said Tuesday. Colin Powell featured Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi's claim in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council. Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi's allegation that Iraqi agents trained al Qaeda operatives in the use of chemical and biological weapons was ""pivotal"" to the Bush administration's case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. ""He's a fairly significant figure in the counterterrorism world, and his testimony I would say provided the linchpin for the invasion of Iraq,"" she said. Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell featured al-Libi's claim in the dramatic presentation he made to the U.N. Security Council just weeks before the invasion, citing it as evidence of ties between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government and the terrorist network responsible for the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Al-Libi recanted his account after the invasion, and no other evidence supported the story, the Senate Intelligence Committee reported in 2006. Al-Libi's death was first reported by a Libyan newspaper over the weekend and confirmed by Human Rights Watch researchers Monday, Sullivan said. The newspaper report said he had committed suicide, and the group is asking Libya to conduct a ""full and transparent"" investigation into his death. Researchers from the New York-based organization were ""stunned"" to discover him in a Libyan prison in April during a fact-finding mission to the North African country, Sullivan said. The United States did not transfer al-Libi to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp with other top al Qaeda captives in 2006, and Washington had never confirmed what happened to him, she said. When prison officials pointed out al-Libi to the researchers, he refused to talk to the group. He told them, ""Where were you when I was being tortured in American jails?"" Sullivan said. ""He got really angry and walked away,"" she said. The Libyan newspaper Oea reported Sunday that al-Libi, born Ali Mohammed Abdelaziz al-Fakhry, had committed suicide in a prison cell in his native country. He had been getting regular visits from his family, the last one in late March, the newspaper reported. ""Upon discovering his body, the police and a doctor were dispatched to the prison immediately to start the investigation,"" Oea reported. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States was investigating the report, but had no immediate comment. ""I have to refer you to the government of Libya for any details regarding the matter,"" he said. Al-Libi had trained al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and was captured in Pakistan in late 2001, according to the Intelligence Committee report. After the invasion of Iraq, he said his statements connecting Iraq to al Qaeda had been made in response to threats by American interrogators and by beatings at the hands of intelligence agents in Egypt, where he was transferred in 2002. ""I think he would be able to tell us more about the secret CIA prison program and the rendition program,"" Sullivan said. Al-Libi told the CIA in 2004 that he had made up the story ""in order to gain better treatment"" and avoid being shipped to Egypt, the Intelligence Committee reported. Egypt denies wrongdoing, but was widely believed to have tortured prisoners in its custody, according to an April report from the Senate Armed Services Committee. As early as February 2002, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency warned that al-Libi ""was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers,"" the Intelligence Committee report states. The CIA supported al-Libi's account, but added language to its January 2003 assessment noting that he would not have had first-hand knowledge of any weapons training, according to the committee. The Bush administration argued that the invasion of Iraq was necessary because Iraq was concealing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs from international inspectors and could have shared those weapons with terrorists. No such stockpiles were found after the invasion, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities.

Hillary Clinton on Saturday will officially suspend her campaign for the presidency and ""express her support for Senator Obama and party unity,"" her campaign said Wednesday. Sen.

The Clinton campaign said she will make the announcement at ""an event in Washington, D.C.,"" where she will also  thank her supporters. Sen. Barack Obama and Clinton were in Washington on Wednesday to each address the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Prominent Clinton backer Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, thinks the New York senator could have been ""far more generous"" during her speech Tuesday night after it was clear that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination. Rangel, the senior member of the New York congressional delegation and an early supporter of Clinton's presidential campaign, said Wednesday that Clinton should have been more clear about what her plans are. ""I would agree that after the math was in before her speech, that she could have been far more generous in terms of being more specific and saying that she wants a Democratic victory,"" Rangel said on MSNBC. ""I don't see what they're talking about in prolonging this,"" Rangel added. ""There's nothing to prolong if you're not going to take the fight to the convention floor. ... I don't know why she could not have been more open in terms of doing up front what she intends to do later."" But with some Democrats clamoring for her to join Obama on the ticket, and with the Democratic National Convention -- and thus, the official anointment -- still more than two months out, the senator from New York gave no hint as to her plans.  See VP prospects' pros, cons » . She again invoked the popular vote, saying she snared ""more votes than any primary candidate in history,"" but primaries come down to delegates, and according to CNN calculations, Obama has her beaten, 2,156 to 1,923. Even the White House seemed convinced of Obama's victory. White House press secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday that President Bush congratulated Obama on becoming the first black nominee from a major party. She said his win shows that the United States ""has come a long way."" Clinton vowed to keep fighting for an end to the war in Iraq, for universal health care, for a stronger economy and better energy policy, but she didn't indicate in what capacity she would wage these battles. That, she said, would be up to her supporters and the party brass.  See what lies in store this fall » . The party's best interests were high on the minds of party leaders Wednesday, as Sen. Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin and DNC Chairman Howard Dean called on Democrats to focus on the general election. ""To that end, we are urging all remaining uncommitted superdelegates to make their decisions known by Friday of this week so that our party can stand united and begin our march toward reversing the eight years of failed Bush/McCain policies that have weakened our country,"" said a statement from the four. Billionaire businessman Bob Johnson, a close Clinton adviser and friend, said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday that Obama could best forge party unity by offering Clinton the vice presidential slot. A day after the final two primaries in South Dakota and Montana, Johnson sent a letter to House Majority Whip James Clyburn to lobby the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Clinton as Obama's running mate. Saying Clinton would ""entertain the idea if it's offered,"" Johnson said, ""This is Sen. Obama's decision. If the Congress members can come together and agree as I do that it would be in the best interest of the party to have Sen. Clinton on the ticket, they carry that petition to Sen. Obama.""  Watch how the world reacted to Obama's win » . ""This is not a pressure. This is elected officials giving their best judgment,"" said Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Johnson's letter to Clyburn says, ""You know as well as I the deep affection that millions of African-Americans hold for both Senator Clinton and President Clinton."" It continues, ""But most important, we need to have the certainty of winning; and, I believe, without question, that Barack Obama as president and Hillary Clinton as vice president bring that certainty to the ticket.""  Watch Johnson urge Obama to pick Clinton » . Johnson is one of many influential Clinton supporters who have raised the prospect of her joining Obama on the ticket.

Clinton said that would happen soon, Gibbs said, but he also said Obama did not raise the issue of the vice presidency. Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe confirmed that there had been ""absolutely zero discussions"" on the matter. The Clinton campaign issued a statement saying she was open to becoming vice president.

56579dc570af488314784c787c79de56fdc239cc,CNN,"(CNN) -- Days before Russia hosts the world for the Winter Olympics, authorities have acted to punish those they say violated a ban on ""gay propaganda,"" a prohibition derided by activists and defended by conservatives, who say it protects young people. Those penalized include Lena Klimova, the creator of an online support group for Russia's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teens, state-run RIA Novosti reported Friday. According to the news agency, the support group features posts from gay teens about dealing with homophobia and trying to gain acceptance in Russia . Activists said Klimova, who set up the Children-404 group on the social networking website Vkontakte, faces a fine of up to 100,000 rubles (about $2,850 U.S.), after an ultraconservative lawmaker urged authorities to look into the site. Vitaly Milonov, who helped lead the push to enact the legislation, told RIA Novosti he made the request believing the group spurs teenagers to question their sexuality. ""Without such groups, no kids like that would exist,"" Milonov said. Passed last summer, the ""gay propaganda"" law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. It has been widely criticized not only by LGBT advocates but also by Western leaders, who have called it archaic and discriminatory. RIA Novosti called Klimova's case the fifth related to the ""gay propaganda"" law since it has been enacted. Another case reported by the same agency on Thursday ended with the editor-in-chief of Molodoi Dalnevostochnik newspaper, in Russia's far eastern Khabarovsk region, being fined 50,000 rubles. Alexander Suturin was punished for a September article about a geography teacher and gay rights activist who said he was pressured into quitting his job and assaulted by neo-Nazis because of his sexuality, according to a RIA Novosti report. Suturin denied during his trial that this story was propaganda and vowed to appeal. These two incidents come about 10 days after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he had not ""heard that this law"" -- meaning the ""gay propaganda"" prohibition -- ""was applied in practice."" ""There are many talks, but no application of the law, practical application,"" Medvedev said, adding that much of the criticism has come from outside Russia. ""So, I believe that this has nothing in common with the real situation in our country."" Days earlier, on January 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended a law that he said was about protecting children, not about banning homosexuality. Putin: Gays 'can feel safe' at Sochi Winter Olympics . ""We have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. But this has nothing to do with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation,"" he told reporters. ""So, there is no danger for people of such nontraditional sexual orientation who are planning to come to the games as guests or participants."" The scrutiny over the law comes at a time when Russia is under the spotlight as host of the upcoming Winter Olympics. They start February 7 in the Black Sea city of Sochi.",1,8.663443961325203
f12fe1e5ad66aec78e1b2e72ec5017b943f831b6,CNN,"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a sharp warning to ISIS militants, saying after the United States is done grieving the death of two American journalists, their killers will have to answer for their actions. ""They should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice,"" he forcefully told an audience at an event on the New Hampshire-Maine border. ""Because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside."" Biden opened his remarks in memory of Steven Sotloff, the journalist who was beheaded by ISIS militants Tuesday, two weeks after James Foley was executed in the same horrific manner on video. Foley was from New Hampshire, while Sotloff lived there for boarding school. ISIS video shows beheading of American journalist . Describing the perpetrators as ""barbarians,"" Biden vowed that Americans would not be frightened or intimidated by the heinous acts. ""We came back after 9/11. We dusted ourselves off and we made sure that Osama bin Laden would never, ever again threaten the American people,"" Biden said. ""We came back Boston strong, blaming no one but resolve to be certain that this didn't happen again."" ""As a nation, we're united, and when people harm Americans, we don't retreat,"" he later said. ""We don't forget."" ISIS executions heighten fears for Western hostages . The vice president, who's mulling a 2016 presidential bid, made his remarks at the Portsmouth Naval Yard in a speech about the economy. He was accompanied on stage by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who's running for re-election this year. Previewing Biden's trip, the campaign for former Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's challenging Shaheen for her seat in this year's midterms, released a Web video that shows footage of the vice president supporting President Barack Obama's foreign policy, an agenda the Brown campaign labels a ""failure."" 'Degrade and destroy' After Sotloff's killing, Obama faced a chorus of bipartisan calls from Congress to act more aggressively and come up with a concrete strategy to combat ISIS, beyond the already ongoing targeted air strikes. Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS. He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that ""might"" require congressional approval. ""Our objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it's no longer a threat,"" he said. ""We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort."" Obama: U.S. won't back down to ISIS . The president said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group. ""We've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things... What we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place,"" he said.",1,7.885172489450111
f85fc22e210e4896cbb048e7d1e517559f3dcc08,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Getting ""out of this world"" with civilian space travel is not quite as simple as you may think. Ready for launch: video game programmer Richard Garriott shown in training for his space flight in October. Aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich, there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift-off. To gain a better insight into this training, well-known video game programmer and designer Richard Garriott, who is preparing for his own space adventure in October, is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler. Garriott has been in training since the beginning of the year and told CNN the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations. ""When I first came here in January, I thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time. Of course, very quickly, I realized that I had signed up for a very complex task, something much more difficult that I had anticipated. I immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight. ""And now that I am so close to the flight, I am still feeling the pressure, I definitively have been working very long days and most nights,"" Garriott said. The training regime has three major strands: physical training, which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment; practical training for day-to-day living in space; and like any flight, be it 10 minutes or 10 days, training in safety procedures for emergency situations. Trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off-site to complete the requirements, which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet. Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, the company sending Garriott into space, told CNN the training program is extensive, but does not exclude people from making the flight. ""Their total training program is a few months, but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives. They are not training to the same degree as the professionals."" As long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health, they can usually go ahead with their adventure, he said. ""There's some fitness involved. There are certainly [medical] things that are not allowable in space, but they are generally more serious conditions."" He said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in ""Gs."" ""The body is designed to live on one 'G,' so when you expose it to higher 'Gs' it has an effect. With the training and given the [short] length of the visits there's a minimal effect on the body."" In his blog on the training process, Garriott said one part of the training was indisputably the worst. ""Hardest of all was the 'Spinning Chair of Ultimate Sickness.' I can't imagine that I will ever again voluntarily sit in a device designed to make you sick, or ride it as long as I can. Ugh, this is definitely my least favorite part of training!"" Despite such disturbing preparations, Anderson said much of the training, which takes place at Space Adventures' base in Star City, Russia, is centered upon general living in space. ""There's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat, how to drink, and how to use the restroom, for example,"" he said. ""There's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment."" Garriott said many of the procedures for living in space, or for emergencies, are very complex. ""There are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms, plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction; the toilet (everybody's favorite piece of space trivia!), including powering up the can for suction and waste removal; and lastly, onboard water sources."" He admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by ""cramming like any good college kid."" And the most fascinating part of the training? In Garriott's opinion, it was running in a hypobaric chamber, where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters (about 2,000 meters higher than Mount Everest). ""I felt no physical or mental problems, but I did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe. Basically, it was possible to make a tennis ball-sized pocket in my mouth, but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum! ""By that I mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed,"" he said. ""However, at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch! Weird."" It truly is.",7,9.450182974517158
5982810ad374344350b41dadcbda2a70dd6fb626,CNN,"(CNN) -- Roger Federer remained on course to complete a career golden grand slam after brushing aside John Isner of the United States in the quarterfinals Thursday. Federer, desperate to add Olympic singles gold to his 17 grand slam titles, struggled to cope with the giant Isner's service but still emerged as a 6-4 7-6 winner on Centre Court. A break in the 10th game of the first set gave the Swiss maestro the early advantage, but he was pushed all the way in the second. It went to a tiebreak where a fortuitous net cord for Federer gave the 17-time grand slam champion his passage to the last four. He will now face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina after the former U.S. Open champion beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6. Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles. Federer beat Britain's Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon crown last month and return to top spot in the world rankings. They could be set to meet again after Murray kept home hopes alive with a 6-4 6-1 dismissal of Spain's Nicolas Almagro in their quarterfinal clash. The Scot, roared on by a partisan home crowd on Centre Court, was never seriously troubled but will have to get past Serbia's Novak Djokovic to get his chance of golden revenge.

4deb26030058ce31d8b28f2ab8d491a78866d9ee,CNN,"South Hadley, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The 15-year-old girl who hanged herself last January after enduring months of bullying from schoolmates failed to alert others to her plight, the superintendent of South Hadley Schools said Thursday. The girl, Phoebe Prince, ""was apparently a very private person; she bore a lot without talking to friends or with her parents or with anybody at school,"" Gus Sayer told CNN. ""She didn't reveal to people what she was being subjected to and, unfortunately, until January 7, we were not aware of what she was being subjected to, so [there was] very little way we could have intervened in the bullying."" Sayer cited two incidents that occurred on January 7. In one, a girl walked into a classroom and called Prince ""an Irish slut,"" he said. The name caller was taken to the principal's office and disciplined, he said. In the other, a girl ""said something threatening about Phoebe"" to another girl, he said. A staff member overheard the comment and reported it to the principal, who took disciplinary action, Sayer said. He said it was school policy not to specify what disciplinary actions may have been taken against any individual student, though he said the latter case did not include expulsion and that the student returned to school. ""To our knowledge the action taken was effective in ending their involvement in any bullying of Phoebe,"" he said. Prince, who had recently moved with her family from Ireland to South Hadley, hanged herself on January 14 after enduring what Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth B. Scheibel described to reporters Monday as ""a nearly three-month campaign of verbally assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm toward Phoebe, on school grounds, by several South Hadley High School students."" Six students were named in an indictment returned by a grand jury Friday and made public Monday. In addition, Scheibel said three female students received juvenile charges, but she would not clarify if they were among the six named in the indictment. That left even Sayer confused. ""There could be as many as nine, but I believe that six"" is the correct number, he said. Though authorities did not consider that the actions or failures to act by the faculty, staff and administrators of the school amounted to criminal behavior, prosecutor Scheibel called for them to undergo training to learn to intervene more effectively in such cases. But administrators in the school district, who oversee the education of 2,100 students in four schools, are being unfairly blamed for the death, Sayer said. Those critics include a number of parents who have demanded that the administrators resign. ""They really don't know what's going on in the schools, but they feel that this shouldn't have happened and that, somehow, it has to be the fault of the schools themselves,"" Sayer said. ""Frankly, I think that grossly oversimplifies the situation."" Sayer said he had received hundreds of vituperative messages from the community. ""They are awful,"" he said, citing one that said he should be ""burning in hell."" He said he was trying to ignore them. None of the six students identified in the indictment remains in school, he added. Sayer said he supported the punishments meted out to the students. ""If they, as they have been charged, committed crimes, they should face the consequences for those crimes,"" he said. But, he added, expulsion is something educators are reluctant to countenance. ""It's a terrible punishment because that changes their whole lives and what they are capable of doing, and they have to figure out a way to renew and complete their education.""

87a400b9fd76aee523ef7b730e349073a50c44e2,CNN,"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Bodies lie scattered in a rural field in the southern Philippines, some unearthed from a shallow grave hastily dug by the gunmen who seized the group of men and women just a day earlier. By Tuesday, search teams had found a total of 46 bodies, and it was still unclear if there were more victims from Monday's massacre. The target was a group that included the female relatives of Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May. Mangudadatu said he had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor Andal Ampatuan -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself. Instead, his wife, sister, and the group of journalists accompanying them were kidnapped and brutally killed, possibly tortured, raped and beheaded, according to local media reports. A local police commander described the grisly search operation near an isolated village, telling reporters from ABS-CBN News that 17 bodies were pulled from a single grave. ""They were piled on top of each other,"" Chief Superintendent Josefino Cataluna said. ""It looked as if they were buried hurriedly."" Those killed included at least 12 journalists, according to the press freedom organization, Reporters Without Borders, making Monday the deadliest single day for journalists anywhere in the world. It was also the worst politically motivated violence in the Philippines' recent history. Witnesses, local officials and analysts have blamed the attacks on Ampatuan, who has controlled the area for a decade and is a long-time ally of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Ampatuan, who is known locally as a warlord, reportedly commands a private army of nearly 500 men. Philippine military officials also said Monday that the gunmen who carried out the attack were loyal to Ampatuan. Neither Ampatuan nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations. ""It's not hard to determine the motive,"" according to Philippine analyst Kenneth E. Bauzon. ""How dare this [Mangudadatu] challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for [the Ampatuan] family."" Ampatuan reportedly wanted one of his sons to succeed him as governor of Maguindanao when he stepped down next year, according to ABS-CBN. A government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave, fueling the belief that Ampatuan or his allies had a role in the massacre. Both the Ampatuan and Mangudadatu clans have agreed to participate in the government's investigation into the killings, according to Arroyo's adviser on the Mindanao region, Jesus Dureza, who spoke to the Philippine media on Tuesday. Neither Ampatuan nor his advisers have spoken publicly about the widespread allegations, and that is most likely because he is ""weighing his options,"" Bauzon said. Now, the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings. The Philippine government has placed Maguindanao and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of Monday's massacre have entered a government witness protection program, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. Arroyo has sent top level government officials to Maguindanao to ""personally oversee military action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts,"" she said Tuesday. ""No effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law,"" she said. Long-running family disputes in the southern Philippines have spilled innocent blood before. Such blood feuds are known by the indigenous term, ""rido."" But Monday's massacre has broader implications, Bauzon said. ""I think that this is a culmination for many years of impunity on the part of any family or group for that matter because this has been tolerated by the Arroyo administration,"" said Bauzon, a political science associate professor at Saint Joseph's College in New York, who is from Mindanao and has authored several books on the region and its politics. ""So when the administration looks the other way when journalists report on military abuses [or] when the administration looks the other way when church workers are assassinated, when environmental workers are assassinated or abducted, you know, this [massacre] is just one or two steps away [from that]."" The killings could further damage the political reputation of Arroyo, whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country. ""It's a test as to what how far the Arroyo administration will go to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators,"" Bauzon said. Arroyo's term ends in May 2010, and she cannot seek re-election although there has been speculation that she could seek another political office. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. Negotiations between one of those armed groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the Philippine government broke down last year after the country's Supreme Court blocked a proposed peace deal that would have increased the size and scope of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Arroyo's government exercises little control in the region and is blamed by her critics for helping legitimize many of the armed groups that operate freely in Mindanao, including those loyal to the governor, Ampatuan. Arroyo issued an executive order in July 2006 that allowed local officials and Philippine National Police to deputize volunteer watchmen, known as barangay tanods, to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions. This order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces. The strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for Arroyo to rout out those behind Monday's mass killing, according to Bauzon. ""The dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task,"" he said. ""The Americans were not able to do it in half a century and all she can do is set her sights low by really going after the most visible of the perpetrators.""

e4c621a143b881561b04e763538192abd93e1af5,CNN,"(CNN) -- A South Boston priest has been placed on administrative leave after his arrest on child pornography charges, which allegedly involved the use of a parish rectory computer. Rev. Andrew Urbaniak, pastor of Our Lady of Czestochowa, is barred from functioning as a priest and was arraigned Wednesday after detectives uncovered pornographic images of young girls on his computer. The children are thought to be between the ages of 8 and 10, police said. When detectives entered the rectory on Tuesday, they apparently found the computer was in the process of downloading material from a peer-to-peer network, according to prosecutors. The nature of that material is not clear. Urbaniak, 39, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after a two-month police investigation of peer-to-peer networks, which involved state troopers assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. He is charged with one count of possession of child pornography and one count of distributing images of a child in the nude. During the investigation, authorities said they noticed files with names that included phrases such as ""pre-teen,"" ""young,"" ""little,"" ""pedo,"" ""pedofilia"" and ""lolitas."" The files were hosted by a computer that was eventually linked to the computer at the Dorchester Avenue rectory, authorities said. ""These charges are serious, and they are especially disturbing given the defendant's position of trust,"" said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. ""They reflect sexually explicit images of very young girls who are, legally and morally, incapable of consenting to such exploitation."" Urbaniak is being held on $10,000 cash bail. Once released, he is required to wear a GPS monitoring device, surrender his passport, be barred from Internet use and have no contact with children younger than 16. Urbaniak has not been charged with enticing a child, and no victims have come forward. His attorney, Jeffrey Denner, said it is their ""intention to assess and obtain all the evidence.""

f108def06a9ee33c1e8c4ffa89051c7b26aa9b9e,CNN,"(CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN. South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said. At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking. Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule. After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him, in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district. Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. Why has North Korea decided to talk now? South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera. Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills. He skipped important anniversary . Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea. Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation. Since his reappearance, North Korea has released several photos of Kim, but has yet to release video. According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She said both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress. After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have swollen due to painkillers. She also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea.

796b387b7ec90fba9ecaf3c550bf953ee3732441,CNN,"London (CNN) -- Never underestimate the power of visualization. ""I was always dreaming about being the best in tennis,"" said world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who became the first Open era player to win three consecutive Australian Open titles after beating Andy Murray 6-7 7-6 6-3 6-2 in Sunday's final. ""I remember as a kid, I was improvising and making little trophies out of different materials and going in front of the mirror, lifting the trophies and saying 'Nole was the champion!'"" The 25-year-old claimed an unprecedented third straight title in Melbourne and cemented his place among the game's all-time greats -- a feat all the more remarkable given the Serb's upbringing amid conflict in the Balkans during the 1990s. ""We didn't have a childhood that is similar to some of our generation of tennis players because we grew up during the war. There was a lot of struggle, difficulty financially ... but we survived,"" said Djokovic, referring to the three-year war which was the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. ""It was really hard to succeed and I have to thank God for the big support from my father and my mother and all the family,"" added Djokovic, who spoke to CNN's Open Court show during the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, prior to the start of the season's first grand slam in Australia. ""They believed in me and gave me hope when I was facing a lot of disbelief, a lot of doubts. Backed and also blessed with some impressive sporting genes -- father Srdjan and his uncle Goran were professional skiers -- Djokovic began his tennis odyssey at the age of four. ""I saw tennis on the TV and I saw the tennis court (near his parent's restaurant in Kapaonik, southern Serbia) and my father brought me a small tennis racket. That's when I think we all fell in love with the sport,"" he explained. It was here that Djokovic caught the eye his first coach Jelena Gencic. ""I knew that Nole would be the best in the world. ""Somebody asked him: 'Hey, boy! What do you want to be when you grow up?' (And he would reply): 'Be the first in pro-tennis.' He was six years old."" That almost in-bred ambition and winning mentality has brought him win four grand slam titles over the past two seasons -- notably claiming his first Wimbledon title in 2011 and his third Australian Open crown in the marathon six-hour final in Melbourne 12 months ago. ""Pressure is a privilege in a way and a big challenge for every professional athlete,"" said Djokovic. ""It's just a matter of understanding it, and maturing as a player and getting that necessary experience to use it at the right moments to cope,"" he says. ""It's a privilege because it means that you are doing something that counts. And all my life I have been dreaming to be the best in what I do and my dreams came true."" Last year, from a psychological standpoint, Djokovic had a lot to cope with. Along with epic victories on court came a great loss off it with the death of his grandfather, Vladimir last April.

She was 30 minutes early at the sprawling store in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, where she had arrived to take advantage of Friday's 4 a.m. post-Thanksgiving clothing deals. But there were no tents, no campers, no eager shoppers waiting to spend their dollars. Preuss said she expected to wait in a line to get service, but people were already inside, and the store was filled with frenzied shoppers. She captured video to document her experience. ""So apparently Wal-Mart did take pity on the poor souls standing outside in the cold and let people into the store early,"" Preuss said. ""Here's how they handle it: They shrink-wrap all the goodies in plastic wrap, so all the good sale items are wrapped in black Saran wrap, and no one can touch them until 4 a.m."" As a self-described ""Black Friday virgin,"" Preuss says, she has lots to learn about the proper technique for this holiday weekend ritual. ""I discovered that I was very unprepared for Black Friday, not dressed properly, as you need more padding to avoid all the shopping carts ramming into you,"" she said. ""I feel like that song, 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,' only the reindeer had a Wal-Mart sign on it."" She decided to see what the hype was about while visiting from Lake Delton, Wisconsin. ""I have three kids, and money is tight,"" she said. ""I'm a single mom. This year, I decided I was going to give it a try and see if I could get some bargains."" Preuss said the lines of people searching for discounted merchandise said a lot about the shape of the economy. Many people were fighting over kids' clothes and other essentials, but she saw much less effort being expended on video games and TV sets. She said she came for the $4 kids' track suits and $8 winter coats. iReport.com: See footage of the shoppers packing the store . Inside the packed store, she began to realize she needed a new strategy to beat the crowds. She decided to grab a bunch of clothing from which to pick. ""I ditched the cart and went in with my bare hands,"" she said. iReport.com: Huge crowd in Puerto Rico . Although Preuss got lucky and immediately entered the toasty store, others across the country were willing to wait in the freezing cold just to get merchandise. Barbara Rademacher woke at 2 a.m. to see the shopping scene and found shoppers huddling outside a Best Buy in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Some had sleeping bags, blankets and winter wear. Chilly hands held lists of the items they planned to buy. ""Laptops!

Rademacher watched a lengthy stream of people cram through the doors when the store opened.

""Whoa, look at all these people,"" Rademacher said. ""I'm less worried about the economy than I might have been."" But even these determined shoppers had nothing on the tented campers spotted by Sean Blake of Houston, Texas, who found several temporary shelters set up outside a Best Buy store on Thursday. He said campers told him the first tents went up on Wednesday morning, two days ahead of the store's 5 a.m. sales deals. iReport.com: Retail campout for the holidays .

9dfd6333d7dc9c0161ba659dcb006e17bcc39d88,CNN,"(CNN) -- In a world of politicians who memorize sound bites and regurgitate them like robots, Joe Biden is different. Biden says it as he sees it. And, yes, that philosophy can lead to a few gaffes. OK, in Biden's case, a lot of gaffes. But that's the risk with being real. Maybe Joe Biden isn't always ""presidential"" as that word has come to be defined, but isn't it about time we revised the definition of that word? Sadly, it has come to mean a staid, reserved person who shows almost no emotion -- almost like Spock from ""Star Trek."" But presidents and vice presidents are still human beings and should be allowed and encouraged to act like it. Look at Biden at Thursday night's vice-presidential debate: He laughed, he almost cried, he got angry, he looked to the heavens, he laughed some more. Joe Biden gave us a veritable one-man show. It was a tour de force. After Biden retires from politics, he should seriously consider touring the nation with a show: ""Being Biden"" or ""Say it ain't so, Joe."" Opinion roundup: Feisty Biden, wonky Ryan . Mitt Romney may now be finally learning how to ""let Mitt be Mitt,"" but that has never been Biden's problem. Joe Biden wears Joe Biden on his sleeve. Biden is a mix of Bill Clinton and Clint Eastwood. He's warm and relatable like Clinton, but also you get a sense of unpredictability as we did when watching Eastwood at the Republican National Convention. (My dream debate is Joe Biden versus Clint Eastwood. Add the empty chair and you have the makings of a hit reality show.) Debate coach: It's the Biden show! There has been a lot written about whether Biden went too far at the debate. Did he laugh too much? Was he too impassioned? Too animated? (One of my favorite moments occurred early in the debate when Ryan was answering a question and Biden turned to the camera a la ""Ferris Bueller"" and gave us a look of: ""You've got to be kidding me."") But does anyone doubt that those were organic reactions by Biden? People can debate all day whether Biden should have reined in his feelings, but those were his true emotions. Romney hammers Biden on Libya remark . Instead of media pundits and the public attacking people like Biden when they show honest emotion, we should applaud it. In fact, we should demand it from all of our presidential candidates. There should be one presidential debate that is not about the dry figures of deficit reduction or oil company subsidies, etc., but about heart. Gergen: Partisans are fired up on both sides . We need a debate that that reveals who they really are beneath their expensive suits with the American flag pins on their lapels. Questions that raise issues that aren't black and white, but hundreds of shades of gray. Such as, what would you to say to the parents of a child who was killed in a war that you pushed for? What do you tell a family that is scraping by to make ends meet about why you think millionaires shouldn't have to pay slightly higher taxes? What would you say to a young woman who doesn't want to have an abortion, but you are advocating cutting the government funding that she needs to raise her child? Opinion: Like a father-son brawl . How would Mitt Romney or President Obama do in response to those type of questions? Probably OK. Obama would be law professoresque but trying to fake some emotion. Romney would give us a memorized answer that has been sanitized by consultants after a gaggle of focus groups. Neither horrible, yet neither compelling. But there is no doubt that Biden would be the big winner. Look, if you want ""Candidate-enstein"" or ""Franken-tician,"" a creature designed by high-priced political consultants from the spare parts of past political campaigns, be my guest. There are boatloads of them. But there's only one Joe Biden. And that is truly a shame. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.",3,11.83031504272972
91272482445569666d9f3f359e22bcad93e09f9e,CNN,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese scientists have produced clones of mice that have been dead and frozen for 16 years -- a feat that could lead researchers to one day resurrect long-extinct species, such as the mammoth. Dolly was cloned using cells from live animals. Now scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species. Until now, scientists have only been able to produce clones using cells from live animals. This is how researchers created Dolly the Sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult animal. Researchers had thought that frozen cells were unusable because ice crystals would have damaged the DNA. That belief would rule out the possibility of resurrecting extinct animals from their frozen remains. But the latest research -- published in the journal, Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences -- shows that scientists may have overcome the obstacle. Researchers at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, used cells from mice that had been frozen for 16 years at -20 Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit). They extracted the nucleus and injected it into eggs whose DNA had been removed. Several steps later, the scientists were able to clone the mice. ""This is the first time a mammal has been cloned from a sample stored at conditions reasonably close to what might be expected in permafrost,"" Teruhiko Wakayama, who led the study, said in a statement. ""(It) gives some hope for those who might seek to clone extinct species from frozen carcasses.""",8,8.464886024060919

Pyle was believed to have been at home with his wife and four grandchildren. When the first firefighters arrived on the scene, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, ""it has been determined that six members of the family are not accounted for,"" the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said. Fire officials said they were alerted about 3:30 a.m. Monday to the fire in the 16,000-square-foot house. About 80 firefighters responded. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting the local fire department, and an ATF national response team is being assembled because the fire was deemed suspicious, a law enforcement official said. The burned-out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause, the official said. The Anne Arundel County Fire Department said fire crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took several hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control, he said.

b5407e6d8decae0544e72995207c053567c6d121,CNN,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of ""You Can Vote However You Like"" catapulted them to online stardom. ""The higher the expectations, the higher the results,"" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students. Now, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just ""one hit wonders."" Academy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary ""Black in America 2,"" hosted by Soledad O'Brien. Cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods. Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers. ""I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,"" says Clark. ""Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results.""  Watch Clark's students perform their original poetry » . But with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun. It's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged. ""My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,"" says seventh-grader Jai Springs. ""I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,"" says Jai. Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from North Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom. Clark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list. Together with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. See newsmakers and iReporters on race, challenges, solutions for black America . Soon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or ""a thousand dollars for each day of the year,"" as Oprah referred to it in the letter. Then came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona. Inspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song ""Whatever You Like,"" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color. When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: ""Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like."" The students ""can talk politics with the best of them,"" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube. ""We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,"" says Clark. One of Clark's credos is teaching a ""global curriculum"" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. Through Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate. ""I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,"" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy. ""My knowledge of the world has improved, I know more about what's going on in other countries and I'm more curious about things. ... I'm just hungry for knowledge,"" says Chi Chi. In fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults. ""I never thought I'd be interested in watching the news,"" says seventh-grader Osei Avril. ""Now I find it interesting because I have learned the stories behind the news,"" he says. Osei -- who pronounces Iranian President Ahmadinajad's name perfectly -- says he's interested in learning about world issues such as the Iranian elections, the Taliban in Pakistan, and the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. ""At the beginning,"" says Clark, ""the kids will say something like 'I've been to East Point [a suburb of South Atlanta]. After a few years they've been to Kenya, Japan, or South Africa, or England. ... They've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves."" But it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students. It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning. ""They want you to pass the people at the top,"" says Jai. ""To be at the top nonstop, be at your fullest, to be creative, to think out of the box."" But school isn't all fun and games, she says. Clark is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students. ""I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me,"" says Chi Chi. ""He might fuss a lot, but I know he's doing it for our own good.""",3,9.366483200508124
8aae4d3253171e429ac4e5292322efc4c4236ff4,CNN,"(CNN) -- A group of former top counternarcotics officials are taking on Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's decision to soften its stance on marijuana legalization. Nine former administrators of the Drug Enforcement Administration wrote Holder to criticize the department's decision not to challenge laws in Colorado and Washington state, which are allowing legal recreational use of marijuana after voter-approved ballot measures. More than two dozen other states and the District of Columbia allow medicinal use of marijuana. The Justice Department last month issued new guidelines to prosecutors intended to focus on more serious trafficking offenses, largely avoiding a conflict with state laws. The federal government still classifies marijuana as one of the most dangerous substances, and it remains illegal under federal law. Buoyed by the Justice Department's move and by public polls showing increasing voter support, pro-marijuana activists are now looking to the ballot box to legalize marijuana in more states. The nine former DEA chiefs, who span the years of the U.S. Drug War dating to the 1970s, aren't moved by changing public opinion on the issue. In the letter dated Monday, they say they were ""shocked and dismayed"" by Holder's move. ""You took an oath of office, as each of us did, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" the former DEA officials say.

58ad9257b0ed8bc23563568334915f3383c1f1b7,CNN,"(CNN) -- The first complete gorilla genome has been mapped by scientists giving fresh insights into our own origins. Gorilla are the last of the genus of living great apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) to have their DNA decoded, offering new perspectives on their evolution and biology. ""The gorilla genome is important because it sheds light on the time when our ancestors diverged from our closest evolutionary cousins around six to 10 million years ago,"" says Aylwyn Scally, postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge and lead author of the report. ""It also lets us explore the similarities and differences between our genes and those of gorilla, the largest living primate,"" he added. Read more: Mapping out a new era in brain research . A team of researchers examined more than 11,000 genes in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, looking for evolutionary clues. Initial findings have revealed that 15% of the gorilla genome is closer to human DNA than to our nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. Researchers found that genes relating to sensory perception, hearing and brain development showed ""accelerated evolution"" in all three, but particularly in humans and gorillas. Having the entire length of the gorilla genome now means scientists can start to compare all the four great apes at every position on the genome, Scally says. It forms the baseline, he says, from which to move forwards and really explore why and when our genes and those of the great apes diverged. ""Did it happen quite quickly or was it something that gradually happened? At the moment we don't know,"" he said. ""It could have been some climatic change that separated humans in the east of Africa from chimpanzees in the forest -- that's an idea some have floated. If we can see some imprint of it in the genome that would be very, very useful information."" Scientists used the DNA of a female western lowland gorilla (called Kamilah) who resides at San Diego Zoo. In the wild, it is the most widespread species of gorilla, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), with a estimated population of 100-200,000 individuals. The majority are found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, west Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Angola. Its cousin, the eastern lowland gorilla, is less prevalent (fewer than 20,000 individuals) and can only be found in the rainforests of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, says WWF.

6721100ffb2afed1b8d228e1d89fdf312fbe436e,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Parents who say that a range of preventive vaccines given their young children can cause serious health problems will have their appeal heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices Monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by Congress in 1986 to address specific claims about safety. The so-called vaccine court has handled such disputes and was designed to ensure a reliable, steady supply of the drugs by reducing the threat of lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms. The questions in the latest case are whether such liability claims can proceed, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been avoided by better product design, and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug. Oral arguments in the dispute will be held in the fall. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, a girl from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area. They said she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. After the third series, according to court briefs, the child began having seizures and became disabled. Now a teenager, Hannah continues to suffer what is described as ""residual seizure disorder."" The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine. The vaccine court rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in the federal courts. Their lawyers said the 24-year-old law does not ban all lawsuits, especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable. A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding that all design-defect claims were barred under statute. Despite that victory, the company urged the high court to hear the case, saying it seeks final resolution on broader legal questions. The Obama administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question. Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in very rare cases. They also say that the vaccine industry is generally not profitable, but that the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business. For that, they say, legal protection provided by Congress is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and affordable. The high court did not act immediately on a another related, pending appeal. The Georgia Supreme Court last year became the first appeals court in the U.S. to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court. That case involved Atlanta-area parents who said their son Stefan Ferrari suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots, by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline, containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. Now 12, the boy is unable to speak, say his parents, Stefano and Carolyn Ferrari. The preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines. Despite winning at the state level, the family has since withdrawn its case, but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in Georgia. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply, promote safety and future research, and compensate innocent victims. Those goals were listed at the time as a ""top public health priority."" Lawmakers acknowledged the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims. Despite Food and Drug Administration approval for the vaccines, companies said they were being driven out of the market. The special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield, designed to be a reliable, relatively quick, no-fault solution to various claims. Unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases. The case accepted is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (09-152). The pending case is American Home Products Corp. v. Ferrari (08-1120).",8,9.570487082768677
2f7068a8bb56dc6c944b6ec2a53751f205cd157f,CNN,"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama said recently that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" to defeat the Islamic State -- also known as ISIS or ISIL -- many people were scandalized. Columnists attacked him for what they said was his admission of a deep failure. His own staff had to run around defending and explaining what he said. It was seen as a terrible blunder. Maybe it was. Or maybe it wasn't. The truth is that 13 years after the September 11 attacks, the United States does not have an effective strategy for dealing with radical Islamists and their deep commitment to waging war against us and against our civilization. Much like the man who has a hammer and therefore assumes every problem is a nail, our bureaucracies have tried for 13 years to redefine the problem into something they are comfortable dealing with. Two long, bitter wars -- Afghanistan is now the longest war in American history, four years longer than the American Revolution and almost three times the length of American participation in World War II -- have not made America and its allies safer. The emergence of the Islamic State, as the terror group calls itself, is a further reminder that the analysis and predictions of the intelligence community, the military and the State Department have often been just plain wrong. Islamic State controls vast regions in two countries and has substantial military equipment. It is not just a new problem in nation-state relations. Whether to engage it inside Iraq or Syria is not the key question. Instead, the most important aspect about Islamic State is that it is a vector for attracting, training and preparing foreign terrorists from all over the world. Islamic State comprises 10,000 potential terrorists from more than 50 countries. Estimates vary widely on how many Americans have gone Syria to join ISIS and other extremist groups. Some officials say dozens have gone; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says ""hundreds."" At least one of them, from Minneapolis, was recently killed. Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments . More than 500 potential terrorists are believed to have traveled from Great Britain to join ISIS. It's believed that the two American journalists were beheaded by the same man, and experts believe he is from England. British Prime Minister David Cameron has begun to recognize the depth and power of the terrorism crisis. He is proposing a series of major legal changes in Britain to eliminate would-be terrorists from British life. There will be even more draconian laws proposed in the near future if this conflict escalates. We are facing a new kind of crisis in the rise of radical Islamists who spread their ideology worldwide through the Internet and through human networking. It is a global phenomenon and the analytical models and strategic patterns that have worked with nation-states will simply fail when applied to the Islamic State and its fellow terrorists in Hamas, Boko Haram, Libyan militants, Yemeni jihadis or any other group. We need a new analysis with new language and new strategies that relate to defeating a viral system that spreads across national boundaries. We're better off with a president who doesn't have a good strategy and knows he doesn't than with a president who has a bad strategy but thinks he has a good one. For most of his administration, the president was firmly in the latter category, so his recent epiphany marks an improvement. If there is a silver lining in President Obama's disastrous foreign policy, it has been in awakening Americans and perhaps even the President himself to the need for a profound rethinking of our approach to radical Islamism.",1,8.461035991618433
e4c9e19a2498dfcf7a466c74013e3f1b702f28aa,CNN,"(CNN) -- A few days ago, a sportswriter friend of mine posted on his Facebook page a picture of a child-sized athletic T-shirt with the words ""Destined to Be Drafted"" printed on front. He commented, ""Just in case anybody thought youth sports culture ISN'T getting outta hand."" Sandusky's child sex abuse allegations: In his own words . On the same day, my home state Arkansas Razorbacks, recently scandalized by the professional and personal improprieties of former football coach Bobby Petrino, introduced their new uniforms with a 1,300-word press release complete with a quote from a freshman player saying, ""I like to look good, so when I was being recruited the uniforms definitely had something to do with my interest in a school."" What does any of this have to do with the abhorrent actions of which Jerry Sandusky is accused? Sandusky is one individual being tried for very specific crimes, sexually abusing young boys. But in the midst of this scandal, it's hard to not also indict the culture that coddled him. College football is one of our national obsessions. We get so wrapped up with the thrills of the games. What we overlook is that like any big-time college sport, it perpetuates the fantasy, which the fans and media readily buy into, that its players are still kids and its coaches are moral leaders. In other organizations or institutions that have dealt with horrible scandals of sexual abuse -- like the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church -- their leaders actually have some claims to moral and civic authority. But why have we granted moral authority to college coaches? It's partly because we all idolize winners. Winning games gives coaches a cloak of invincibility. They are considered ""first citizens,"" as ancient Rome called its emperors, rather than citizens first. They seem immune to the rules that apply to the rest of us. It's easy to think they can do no harm. For that reason, we excuse them when they throw tantrums, which we interpret as being ""passionate."" In any other profession, those tantrums would result in being fired. Where the head football coach is the highest paid state employee, it's no wonder that a sense of proportion has gone out the window. In Arkansas, for example, six of the top 10 salaried state employees are in the state university's athletic department. Under this culture of adulation, someone like Sandusky is more likely to get a pass for questionable behavior. No one could have conceived of him as being anything other than an upright molder of men, even if there were signs to the contrary. Those who come into contact with him are more likely to look the other way than to scrutinize anything unusual. Opinion: In Sandusky trial, a second act for McQueary? At the same time that we elevate the coaches to a pedestal, we infantilize the college athletes. Whenever I hear announcers refer to ""these kids"" on a team -- while in the context of a police report or a voting booth or a battlefield death, an 18-year-old would be a ""man"" -- I have to shake my head. To the athletic programs, they are essentially low-wage workers with high school degrees in a big business. The sooner we abandon the pretension that all players are student athletes and that coaches are role models for men, the sooner we can regain a sense of reality. That said, there's plenty of room for athletes to be students and vice versa. There also are many good coaches out there who would make strong mentors to kids of all ages. But let's not pretend that coaches are on a higher moral ground just because they are heading a winning team. If we see coaches as real people rather than heroes, then we can regain a healthy dose of skepticism. Maybe then toddler T-shirt messages will go back to being appropriate for the age and a college sports team's uniform won't matter as much. 'Sandusky 8' describe seduction, betrayal .

7dffc04e7bcbaee889f4f9cb93ae1c0e2fa04988,CNN,"(CNN) -- A Utah judge Tuesday sentenced polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life for his conviction on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, a court spokeswoman said. Warren Jeffs listens to closing defense arguments during his trial in St. George, Utah, in September. The consecutive sentences mean Jeffs will serve at least 10 years. The exact amount of time he serves will be determined by the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole in the future. Jeffs, 51, the ""prophet"" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, was convicted in September. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. Fifth District Judge James Shumate ordered that Jeffs be remanded immediately to the Utah State Prison near Salt Lake City, and fined him about $38,000.   Watch the judge sentence Jeffs » . Jeffs will receive credit for time served, Shumate said. The girl, Elissa Wall, now 21, testified that she repeatedly told Jeffs at the time that she did not want to be married and was uncomfortable with sexual advances from her husband, Allen Steed. Jeffs advised her to pray and to submit to her husband, learn to love him and bear his children -- or risk losing her ""eternal salvation,"" the woman testified. Wall's attorneys made her name public at the end of the trial, with her consent.  She is married to someone else and has left the FLDS. Questioned by Shumate during Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Wall maintained she did not seek restitution from Jeffs. ""My restitution is knowing that I spoke the truth, and you and the justice system have done your job, and I respect that very much, and I have faith and confidence that you will continue the healing process for me,"" she told the judge. Offered the opportunity to speak, Jeffs did not. He showed no reaction as the sentence was imposed. In sentencing Jeffs, Shumate noted that 14 is under the legal marriage age in Utah and said Jeffs knew the marriage was unlawful. ""First cousins of this age cannot marry lawfully in the state of Utah,"" he said. He also denied a motion filed November 9 by Jeffs' defense attorneys asking him to set aside the jury's verdict. ""A reasonable juror could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt from the state's purely circumstantial evidence that Jeffs encouraged another to rape Elissa Wall,"" the motion said. Defense attorney Wally Bugden told Shumate he intends to appeal. ""We intend to do everything we can to reverse the verdict,"" Bugden told reporters after the hearing. ""We do not believe the facts and the law support the charge of accomplice to rape."" See a timeline of events leading up to the sentencing » . Two weeks ago, Shumate unsealed court documents indicating that Jeffs tried to hang himself while he was awaiting trial in January. The documents, released at the request of the media, also indicated that Jeffs confessed to ""immorality"" with a ""sister"" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. The FLDS calls adult women ""sister,"" so Jeffs' meaning is unclear. Jeffs' attorneys said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that their client recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when he made those statements. Members of the FLDS, based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, openly practice polygamy. Jeffs, who is considered a prophet by his followers, has led the 10,000-member sect since his father's death in 2002. The FLDS is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has drawn critical attention to the FLDS by allegedly arranging marriages to girls as young as 13, exiling male teens and young men to reduce competition for brides, and reassigning the wives and children of excommunicated male followers. Jeffs, who was once on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, was captured in Nevada in August 2006 after two years on the run. In addition to the Utah charges, he also faces multiple counts in Arizona of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors. E-mail to a friend .",1,7.759130576382211
7a0dc0a1f25bd46fb262b67c2b6533395d994b41,CNN,"Editor's Note: Alfred Liggins is chief executive officer of Radio One Inc. and chairman of TV One LLC. The companies are aimed at an audience of African-American and urban consumers, and they own 53 radio stations in 16 cities, a cable network and a variety of Web sites. Liggins personally has contributed to Barack Obama's campaign. Alfred Liggins says the black population in America has grown increasingly diverse. (CNN) -- If you think African-Americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for Barack Obama, you're probably right. If you think you know how they'll vote in the almost 500 House, Senate and gubernatorial races, you could be in for a surprise. Although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to Black America as a collective, homogeneous group, the black population is anything but a monolith. In the past decade, the more than 40 million strong black population in America has become increasingly diverse: economically, socially, technologically and even philosophically. In the final push toward Election Day, as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community, they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking. Are they addressing blacks or African-Americans? Is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent? iReport.com: Black college cancels class to vote . Radio One, the country's largest broadcasting company primarily targeting African-Americans, recently commissioned a study to uncover Black America today. How do they identify themselves? What do they care about? How are they influenced? What is most important to them? Interestingly, the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black (these are more likely to be more affluent) compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as African-American. And yes, it would be misguided to assume that dropping a Martin Luther King Jr. quote into a speech and focusing on America's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one-third of blacks, particularly younger people, believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression. And as insulting as it is to assume that all women vote for female candidates, it is equally inaccurate and offensive to say that blacks simply cast their ballots for people of color. Like all Americans, black folks vote on the issues they care about, and today those issues are less likely to be linked to race than they are to the economy, health care, education and a whole spectrum of social issues. As Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson recently said, ""black people don't vote for candidates just because they are black. If Clarence Thomas ran for president, he would get five black votes."" Given Black America's extreme diversity today (the study identified 11 specific groups) it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached. Yes, discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important, particularly to middle-age and older blacks. But the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses, paying for their education, taking care of their children and creating a better work/life balance. So how do politicians penetrate the multiple segments of Black America? In 1992, when Bill Clinton wooed African-Americans in church, he understood how to effectively reach that population. But that was before social networking sites attracted millions of teenage and young black adults. Now that the digital divide has faded, with roughly the same percentage of blacks online as the general population, ignoring black Web sites and social networking sites would be a big mistake. Although the history of black oppression in America is not the radioactive issue it once was, trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount. Of all institutions, they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets. It has been almost a century and a half since blacks in America won the right to vote. It makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years, but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues. Though Barack Obama will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on Election Day, the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today's black voters.

8f323720296a49711c19d224f7f9034e2d511d0f,CNN,"Cairo (CNN) -- Forty-three people, including 19 Americans, face prosecution in an Egyptian criminal court on charges of illegal foreign funding as part of an ongoing crackdown on nongovernmental organizations, a prosecution spokesman said Sunday. Those referred to court also include five Serbs, two Germans and three Arabs, said Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor. The remaining people are Egyptian, he said. The defendants include Sam LaHood, International Republican Institute country director and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Saeed said. The defendants were named by an investigation committee created by Egypt's justice minister, Egypt's state-run Nile TV reported. ""We have seen media reports that judicial officials in Egypt intend to forward a number of cases involving U.S.-funded NGOs to the Cairo criminal court,"" said Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department. ""We are deeply concerned by these reports and are seeking clarification from the government of Egypt."" Egyptian authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 NGOs in late December, but offered no clear explanation for the raids as they happened. A spokesman with the general prosecutor's office said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations the groups had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license. Three U.S.-based organizations operating in Egypt were part of the raids. Egyptian police confiscated everything from desks, cell phones, documents and computers to office safes, Leslie Campbell with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs told CNN in an interview just after the raids. U.S.-based Freedom House and the International Republican Institute (IRI) reported their offices were raided as well. Despite assurances the State Department says were given to the U.S. ambassador by Egyptian authorities, two of the NGOs said that as of early January, no property or cash had been returned. ""We had been assured by leaders in the Egyptian government that this issue would be resolved, that harassment would end, that NGOs would be allowed to go back to business as usual and that their property would be returned,"" State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said last month. ""It is, frankly, unacceptable to us that that situation has not been returned to normal."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson both spoke with high-ranking Egyptian officials following the raids to voice their concern. Nuland said last month there are apparently ""some Mubarak holdovers in the government who don't seem to understand how these organizations operate in a democratic society, and are putting out lots of disinformation about them."" Human Rights Watch called Sunday for Egyptian authorities to drop the charges and stop the criminal investigation into the NGOs. ""The Egyptian authorities are using a discredited Mubarak-era law to prosecute nongovernmental groups while proposing even more restrictive legislation,"" said Joe Stork, Human Rights Watch's deputy Middle East director, in a statement. ""The government should stop using the old law, halt the criminal investigations and propose a law that respects international standards."" The IRI said in a statement Sunday the reported prosecution ""reflects escalating attacks against international and Egyptian democracy organizations,"" calling it a ""politically motivated assault."" Egyptian officials have called it a ""legitimate judicial process,"" the organization said, but ""the continued assault on American, German and Egyptian civil society is not a 'legitimate judicial process.' It is a politically motivated effort to squash Egypt's growing civil society, orchestrated through the courts, in part by Mubarak-era holdovers."" The National Democratic Institute said in a statement that while it does not know specifically which individuals or organizations are implicated, it was ""deeply concerned about this development."" ""NDI conducts all of its nonpartisan activities in Egypt in an open and transparent manner, and has cooperated fully with this probe,"" it said. ""NDI applied for registration through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2005 and has fulfilled all of the registration requirements for the past six years, including a number of updates provided in January."" In late January, U.S. government officials said Sam LaHood was among three Americans taking refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo because they voiced concerns about their personal safety. ""We do not believe they were in physical danger, but they had concerns, and they were invited by the embassy,"" Nuland said, explaining that the Americans had approached embassy staff. ""This was a unique situation,"" Nuland said, adding that those in the Embassy are not trying to avoid the legal process. Sam LaHood said while he felt ""safe physically,"" he was concerned that the investigation into the work of American non-governmental organizations has ""taken on a more serious nature, and the next step from here would either be arrest or go to trial."" Egypt's investigation of and raids on U.S. democracy support groups working in that country could mean the end of U.S. aid to Egypt, members of Congress told top Obama administration officials, as well as the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, last week. In a February 2 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Panetta, 41 members of Congress urged the administration to withhold further aid to Egypt until the country's leadership lets the offices of those organizations reopen and returns seized property. Members of Congress issue warning on U.S. aid to Egypt . The United States sends more than $1.3 billion each year in military aid to Egypt, according to the U.S. State Department. And, since 1975, the U.S. Agency for International Development has provided more than $28 billion in economic and development assistance to Egypt. ""The absence of a quick and satisfactory resolution to this issue will make it increasingly difficult for congressional supporters of a strong U.S.-Egypt bilateral relationship to defend current levels of assistance to Egypt, especially in this climate of budget cuts in Washington,"" the letter warns. ""It's essential that Egypt not take any legal action whatsoever against these NGO workers,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Sunday. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's ruling military council, assumed control of the government following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak last year. ""We're being accused of things we've never done,"" IRI President Lorne Craner said last month. ""We are told we have operated without registration, and that is true because we filed our registration papers five and a half years ago. We were told the papers are complete and we're still waiting."" ""We've operated for 30 years, everywhere from (dictator Augusto) Pinochet's Chile to Nicaragua, to the Soviet Union when it was the Soviet Union, to Central Europe, to Indonesia under Suharto,"" he said. ""We work in China, Belarus. This has never, ever happened in the 30 years where we get our offices raided. And Egypt is supposed to be an American friend.""

4da57e2d3e5678e84c89f7b1750b8acaad95b42e,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will ease some restrictions on defense sales to Vietnam, the State Department announced Thursday, following a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Vietnamese counterpart. While this change is limited to maritime security-related sales, it is a significant step forward for the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. The United States previously maintained a full arms embargo on the country, which started during the Vietnam War nearly 40 years ago. During his meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, Kerry emphasized that any change to defense cooperation will be tied to Vietnam's human rights record, according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Our security relationship remains under constant review,"" Psaki said in a news briefing. ""Clearly, there's more work that needs to be done in areas like human rights, and that's one thing that the secretary conveyed during the meeting. And this is, of course, a partial lifting.""

""Well, in part,"" she said, ""in order to fully integrate Vietnam into maritime security initiatives that, you know, we have partnerships on throughout the region.""

0a6802873f762054e3f09781c73cb884ee5bab3f,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Angelina Jolie was on a stage Thursday but wasn't performing. Instead, she paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people across the globe made homeless by war. Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties. A U.N. goodwill ambassador, Jolie was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The poignant ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations refugee agency. Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they'd seen in refugee camps. ""I believe we must persuade the world that refugees must not be simply viewed as a burden,"" she said. ""They are the survivors. And they can bring those qualities to the service of their communities and the countries that shelter them."" Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan. She met a boy about 15 years old in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since a shot in the back paralyzed him. His family was killed, leaving him as an orphan. Yet when he spoke with her, he did it with a smile. ""He had this really remarkable, unbreakable spirit,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the event at the National Geographic Museum. ""I think of him and I can't complain about anything ... he was grateful and he had nothing and suffered everything."" The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said. According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers. Afghans and Iraqis constituted almost half of all refugees worldwide. One out of four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, agency officials found. Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee. She lived in a small, roofless dirt house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with the others because she was too far along in her pregnancy. Pakistan struggles with the largest refugee population in the world, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced citizens, largely because of the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban since April. Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N.'s refugee agency, elaborated on the plight of displaced people at the event. He said internally displaced people ""face the same plight [as refugees]. They have lost the same as refugees. They don't have the same international protections granted to refugees."" Conflicts like those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, though the number of displaced people declined by about 700,000 in 2008, the report said. Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia last year brought total displacement in each to 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. More than 2 million internally displaced people were in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the report. When a genocide targeting Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 later spilled over into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi, was caught in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal. Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into a death camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said through tears. While at the prison, she learned that she was pregnant. She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor, Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her captors' surprise, she named her newborns after them. Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal. Mapendo, named a CNN Hero in October, created Mapendo International, a nonprofit dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the U.N. agency. ""I want to encourage the refugees don't give up,"" she said. Giving up ""is not an option.""

The last time we saw your cicada variety, known as Brood II, emerge was in 1996. Other broods have come and gone since then, but we're still glad to see you. You were still in your larval stage in '96, so you probably don't remember. Now, you're rising to the surface and having a grand ol' party. So much so that CNN is tracking readers' reports of your locations and listening to recordings of your buzz. We humans have a hard time imagining what it must be like to go into hiding for years on end and leave your fate in the hands of the world. Who knows what the world will be like when you next emerge 17 years from now? Will it be a mundane place or a strange post-apocalyptic scene? That's why we're so in awe of you. You are like living time capsules, and you take it in stride. Life is one big, buzzing party for you. Open Story: See where readers are finding cicadas . But all good things must come to an end, and before you go, we'd like to bring you up to speed on the things you've missed since you were last here. It's probably not pleasant to think about, but we want to reach you in time. We were inspired to write you this letter because of a heartfelt iReport we received from Janie Lambert of Hughesville, Maryland. She talked about many events that have happened in the past 17 years. Like your species, her family has hatched a new generation of offspring during this time. Your buggy brains aren't really geared for philosophy, but here's a grub of an idea: the tragedy of your lives is a metaphor for our own. It's too bad you barely missed Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet,"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles. It came out in fall 1996 -- well after you would have ducked into the ground. And don't forget about ""Tromeo and Juliet,"" which also came out around that time. Bet you would have related to William Shakespeare's infamous star-crossed lovers, who were destined to shack up and then die while still in their teens. We think you would also have a special appreciation for the ""Austin Powers"" movie trilogy, which kicked off in 1997. It features a British spy who is cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and then emerges in the 1990s with a strong mating instinct. Strip away the bad teeth and Union Jack decor, and your stories are much the same. Read about cicada life cycles and other broods . Culture shock was a big part of the ""Powers"" films, and you're probably feeling like a Rip Van Winkle as well. Surely you must be wondering where you can get some pogs, or the latest dramatic twists and turns in the Van Halen line-up. Radiohead released several acclaimed albums (including ""OK Computer"" and ""Kid A"") as well. Heck, there was even a Woodstock anniversary concert in 1999. A few years later, an electronic band called Cicada formed in the UK. Their self-titled debut album (2006) will make your feelers twitch. It includes a song called ""Cicadas"" that intermingles rhythmic buggy noises with sweet synthetic sounds. You skipped most of the boy/girl bands -- just barely. The Backstreet Boys put out their self-titled album in June 1996 and *NSYNC rose soon thereafter. The Spice Girls released their debut album ""Spice"" worldwide by 1997, and Britney Spears reached stardom status in the late 1990s. The Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez ... there's so many. The brothers Hanson MMMBopped their way onto the charts in 1997 when they were just nymphs. They continued to put out albums after they finished molting, and now generate almost as much buzz as you do -- and have produced nearly as many larvae. Oh, and we almost forgot to mention ""Star Wars""! There are now three prequels to come before the first ""Star Wars"" (that was really Episode IV), and there's this character called Jar Jar Binks and ... never mind. You've had to digest so much already. If you're still unsure about what happened in the 1990s, BuzzFeed is totally on it. Any relation? They're about as cicada-like as humans get, constantly searching for whatever happens to be buzzing at any given time. The writers are in their laboratories concocting nostalgia for the 2000s as we speak. But we don't want to bug you with too much popular culture. There's also plenty of serious history that you've missed. We've been through five presidential elections now, and three presidents. The truth is, maybe you're better off not having seen footage of the September 11 terror attacks, or the wars that began afterward. You also conveniently missed the biggest burst of the housing bubble, or running the risk of getting laid off during the Great Recession. You can't bring most liquids through airport security anymore, and the NASA space shuttle program as we knew it has ended. In 1999, the technology world fretted over the Y2K bug, in which a date-formatting issue threatened to bring down computer programs everywhere. Concerns about serious problems seemed largely unfounded when 2000 finally rolled around. Cicadas should also be aware that the ""New Beetle"" was released by Volkswagen in 1998, which in turn renewed humans' desire to drive a bug. In the world of devices, the BlackBerry device is still consumed in its addictive CrackBerry form, but plenty of two-leggers are using smartphones and tablets with touchscreens. (You don't have hands, so you might need a keyboard that you can tap with your legs.) You fast-forwarded through the meteoric rise of the World Wide Web, and the spider-like reach of social media. You missed complaining about several Facebook layout iterations and being friends with that guy named Tom on MySpace in the 2000s. You can still be friends with him now, but it's just not the same. The predictable backlash toward spending too much time online works to your advantage, because you're well-equipped for it. You spend just about all your time in the out-of-doors, happily buzzing away and doing your thing until your time comes. Dying cicadas spotted in Staten Island . You're probably not worried about all these things that bipeds are always fussing about, but we just thought we'd let you know. Maybe there's a few things we're missing out on, as well. If there's any consolation, it's that other broods will return in the coming years, albeit in varying places and at different intervals. Brood III, Brood X, you name it. But there's only one Brood II. Until we meet again with your descendants 17 years from now, let's all say goodbye and farewell. Buzzing off, . The People of Planet Earth .

Both will line up in Florida for the final event of the U.S. circuit's Fall Series, with $846,000 on offer for the winner from a total prize purse of $4.7 million. Donald had been in pole position in his bid to become the first golfer to top both the U.S. and European money lists in the same season, but Simpson went $363,029 clear in the PGA standings despite suffering a playoff defeat to fellow American Ben Crane at the McGladrey Classic on Sunday. Englishman Donald, who went to a friend's wedding instead, will now need to finish second or higher at the Children's Miracle Network Classic at Disney World starting on Thursday to usurp Simpson. Simpson has won $6.2 million so far from 25 events, while Donald is on almost $5.84 million from 18. The 26-year-old Simpson is seeking to cap an incredible breakthrough year in which he won his first title at Wyndham Championship in his home state of North Carolina in August, then triumphed in the second event of the FedEx Cup playoffs and narrowly missed out on the $10 million jackpot when he faded to 22nd at the Tour Championship. ""I think coming in, finishing second is going to make it a lot harder for Luke,"" world No. 12 Simpson told the PGA Tour's official website. ""But I'm sure he's going to play well. He's played well most every week this year. I still wouldn't be surprised if I have a little work to do next week. ""It would be nice to run away with it, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's going to be pretty close. Winning would take care of a lot, I think."" Crane said his form over Sunday's final round was ""as good as I can play"" after claiming his fourth title. The new world No. 50 carded eight birdies in the final 11 holes to finish on 15 under par, before Simpson bogeyed at the second additional hole to hand Crane victory. ""Is that right?"" Crane said when he heard the statistics from his impressive round. ""What the heck? Wow. That's as good as I can play. ""I just said, 'Well, if I'm going to have a chance, I'm going to have to birdie two of the last three holes.' ""Newsflash: If you don't birdie the first one and you're dormie with two holes to play and you've got to make two birdies, it gets harder. I read it perfectly and the ball went right in the middle and I was just thrilled."" Despite the win, his first since the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2010, Crane had little time to celebrate, with his wife Heather due to give birth to their third child on Monday. ""I told my wife, 'I don't even know if I should -- what am I doing here? You're about to go into labor ... Should I even be playing this week?' "" he said . ""I was driving, bringing the car down after the playoff was over, and someone said, 'Well, you've got to name the baby -- the baby's middle name has got to be McGladrey or Frederica ... Sea Island.'"" American Michael Thompson mised out on the playoff by one shot as he finished third ahead of 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen's fellow South African and 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman was fifth on 12 under, two shots clear of a five-way tie for sixth place which included two-time major winner Angel Cabrera. Jim Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion who topped the PGA Tour money list in 2010, tied for 11th on nine under.",1,13.488872582053583
545befab509b2fc12bfc309bd19e2ffd6171a2d5,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A man who was raised at Camp Lejeune told lawmakers Thursday that he blames contaminated water at the U.S. Marines training base for his breast cancer. Government records show decades of contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Michael Partain, who was diagnosed two years ago at the age of 39, told the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs that his parents were stationed at the base in North Carolina when he was born. At least 40 former U.S. Marines or sons of Marines who lived at Camp Lejeune have been diagnosed with the cancer that strikes fewer than 2,000 men a year, compared with about 200,000 women. The committee hearing was focused on exposure by military personnel to hazardous materials in the United States, Japan and Iraq, including toxic smoke from burn pits in Iraq and contaminated water. Partain said that during his mother's pregnancy, the family was exposed to high levels of tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene, benzene and vinyl chloride in the tap water at the military base. ""I am one of about 40 men who share this unique commonality of male breast cancer and exposure to contaminated tap water [at] Camp Lejeune,"" he told the committee. The Marines with breast cancer served or lived at Camp Lejeune between the 1960s and 1980s. Government records show that the camp's water was contaminated for three decades. Although the Marine Corps contends that two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease don't believe it. Partain said his illness has been been a ""traumatic, emotional and physical"" ordeal for his family. Two North Carolina senators -- Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat who is not a panel member -- are pushing legislation that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover the medical costs of Marines and their families who were exposed to the contaminated water. The provision, which has passed the Senate, would amend the Defense Appropriations Bill to prohibit the Navy from ""disposing of water-contamination claims before critical scientific studies can be completed."" According to Hagan, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is conducting human health and water modeling studies to determine whether the toxic water contributed to health problems at the base. Some of the water was contaminated with toxins at concentrations up to 280 times what is currently considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hagan said. The bill covers the period between 1957 and 1987. ""I think it should be our mission to give these families complete answers,"" she said. ""They can't get closure until the remaining CDC studies, which are in progress, are complete."" Sen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, added, ""I am deeply concerned about possible environmental hazards in places where we are fighting two wars."" He and other senators agreed that current military personnel and veterans should not have to battle red tape to get health care and benefits. Russell Powell, a medic with the 1092nd West Virginia Army National Guard, said that from April 2003 to June 2004, the unit was assigned to the Qarmat Ali water treatment plant in Basra, Iraq, to provide security for contractors with KBR, an engineering and construction company hired by the Defense Department to provide services in Iraq. When the platoon reached the plant, they found it in disarray and coated with orange-colored dust, he testified. Large bags of the dust had been ripped open, and frequent dust storms blew through the facility, he said. At no time were the security guards offered protective clothing, masks or respirators, Powell said. After a few weeks, several soldiers began getting lesions on their hands, arms, faces and nostrils. ""As a medic, I felt very concerned for the safety and health of persons exposed. I questioned one of the KBR workers, and he told me that his supervisors told him not to worry about it, that we were allergic to sand and dust,"" according to Powell. When he went to a military doctor with his symptoms, the physician prescribed Motrin and Tylenol. Soon after, Powell began coughing up blood and was hospitalized. His face and lips were burned, and he could barely swallow, he said. Powell left Iraq in April 2004, still suffering symptoms, he said. Doctors didn't know what it was. This year, he said, he received a letter from the West Virginia National Guard that said he and others may have been exposed to sodium dichromate. The medic said he's aware that research is being done. Sodium dichromate is a poisonous red-orange crystalline compound. Another witness, Stacy Pennington, cried in the hearing room as she described the agony her brother suffered before he died. Army Staff Sgt. Steven Ochs was 27 when he was deployed to Iraq in 2003, she said. He was assigned at one point to Balad Air Base in northern Iraq, where there was a large burn pit: a junk pit where plastics, food, medical waste and, Pennington said, possibly even body parts were burned. The toxic smoke wafted over the area. Dr. Bill Halperin, who heads a subcommittee of the Defense Health Board, an advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense, said in a presentation last year that before three incinerators were installed, the burn pit received as much as 500,000 pounds of waste a day. After Ochs returned from his third Iraq tour, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, his sister said. He spent 10 months at Duke University Hospital, where doctors, she said, told him that his aggressive form of the disease was ""definitely chemically induced"" by exposures to toxic materials in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Ochs also had served.",3,5.860457691088281
e05ed3672712746c424947a6f2e53735dfbf031a,CNN,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (CNN) -- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has filed genocide charges against Sudan's president for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. The U.N. estimates 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in Darfur. Luis Moreno-Ocampo on Monday urged a three-judge panel to issue an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to prevent the deaths of about 2.5 million people forced from their homes in the war-torn region of Darfur and who are still under attack from government-backed Janjaweed militia. The five charges against al-Bashir include masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war-torn region with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Nic Robertson in the Dutch city of The Hague, the prosecutor said: ""After three years I have strong evidence that al-Bashir is committing a genocide. I cannot be blackmailed, I cannot yield. Silence never helped the victims. Silence helped the perpetrators. The prosecutor should not be silent."" Read a transcript of the interview . The judges must now decide whether to issue the warrant, although they have approved all 11 of Moreno-Ocampo's previous submissions to the court. The indictment against al-Bashir marks the first time prosecutors at the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal have issued charges against a sitting head of state.  Watch as ICC prosecutor targets al-Bashir » . At a news conference Monday in Khartoum, Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha rejected the authority of the ICC, saying Sudan was not a signatory to the court's creation. ""Hence there is no legal obligation or power over Sudan, whether Sudanese organizations or citizens,"" he said. Taha also called the charges an attempt to ""paralyze"" his country. And Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, said his government would respond through legal, political and ""other means."" ""The limit is the sky for our retaliation,"" he said. He said the country is not mobilizing its military, but has been organizing demonstrations in support of al-Bashir. The United Nations said Monday it is evacuating non-essential staff from Darfur ""due to the recent deteriorating security situation,"" but the joint African Union-U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) vowed to maintain its operations. In his request, Moreno-Ocampo says there are reasonable grounds to believe al-Bashir bears criminal responsibility for five counts of genocide, two counts of crimes against humanity, and two counts of war crimes. The alleged crimes stem from a brutal counter-insurgency campaign the Sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in Sudan's western Darfur region in 2003. The United States and much of the world has already characterized the campaign as genocide. The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength. About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes.  Watch a tour of Darfur's deserted Northern Corridor » . But Mohamad said the prosecutor's move could hurt the United Nations, which will still have to deal with Sudan's government on issues related to Darfur and in the peace process in the country's south, where a long-running civil war ended in 2005. ""It will put the chief negotiator in a very awkward situation. How is he going to deal with an indicted president,"" the ambassador said. ""How is the secretary-general going to do business regarding UNAMID with an indicted president?"" Moreno-Ocampo says al-Bashir targeted three ethnic groups living in the region -- including the Fur group, for whom Darfur is named -- solely on account of their ethnicity. Al-Bashir bears responsibility, Moreno-Ocampo says, because he sat at the apex of the government. ""For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur, al-Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus; he had to control and direct perpetrators; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan,"" Moreno-Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request. In Khartoum, a crowd of about 2,000 people greeted al-Bashir, who seized power in a 1989 coup, when he arrived for an emergency meeting of his Cabinet Sunday to discuss the charges. When he saw the crowd, al-Bashir climbed onto a pickup truck and pumped his fist in the air, whipping the group into a frenzy. Some held signs saying, ""You are joking... Ocamp-who?"" and ""Death to America."" A high-ranking ambassador at the presidential palace called the possible prosecution stupid and malicious, and warned that the Sudanese people would see it as proof of a larger conspiracy against the country.  Watch why Sudan's leader has support in China » . In 2005, the Security Council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions related to Darfur by the ICC, a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan. The attacks in Darfur over the past five years have followed a common pattern, according to Moreno-Ocampo. Members of Sudan's armed forces, often acting together with the militias and under al-Bashir's command, singled out villages and towns inhabited by tribal groups. Troops and militia members shot and killed civilians, and sometimes the Sudanese air force was called in to bomb villages and towns in support of the ground forces, the prosecutor's evidence says. Residents who fled were often chased and attacked or left to fend for themselves in the wilderness, the evidence says. The attacks, it says, undermined the ability of the targeted groups to survive in Darfur. The destruction of their homes scattered entire communities, and the pervasive rape and sexual violence against girls and women -- who are often targeted when they are out collecting firewood or water -- has torn families apart.  Watch how UNICEF is trying to prevent rape in Darfur » . ""They are raping women, raping girls, raping in groups -- raping to destroy the communities,"" Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. ""Rape is a tool in the genocide -- the most important tool today."" The ICC has already indicted two men for Darfur crimes -- Ahmad Harun, Sudan's former minister of the interior who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government and militia leader Ali Kushayb -- but neither has been brought to justice. Once the ICC indicts someone, authorities in that person's native country -- or the country in which the indicted person is located -- have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the Hague. Kushayb and Harun both remain in Sudan where they enjoy the protection of al-Bashir, Moreno-Ocampo said. Since they have not been arrested, the prosecutor says, it is unlikely al-Bashir will be -- and he says it will probably take a U.N. Security Council resolution for al-Bashir to be brought to justice. Senior Sudanese government leaders have previously told CNN that reports of atrocities in Darfur are exaggerated. ""Yes, there has been a war and some people have died, but it's not like what has been reflected in the media,"" Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid said last month.

a56a19dd299455c567a8d38123203b05f7464383,CNN,"(CNN) -- The U.S. government Friday defended its handling of James Foley's case after the slain journalist's mother told CNN that officials suggested the family could be charged if they tried to raise money to free him. Saying everything possible had been done to bring the journalist home, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters officials worked very closely with Foley's family and with his employer, GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni. ""Any advice that this department or other departments give to the families about what they should do in these situations is based solely on what is best for returning their loved one home, period,"" Harf said during a sometimes testy exchange with reporters. ""Any accusation to the contrary is flatly wrong."" Foley was beheaded in a video made public by ISIS on August 19. ISIS -- the terror group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to Foley's execution, his captors demanded 100 million euros ($132.5 million) in exchange for his release, according to GlobalPost. The U.S.-based online news agency never took the demand seriously because ransoms paid for other hostages held by ISIS were dramatically less, Balboni has said. Harf cited Balboni's statement regarding the ransom demand, while reiterating that under anti-terrorism laws in the United States it is illegal to negotiate with terrorists, such as ISIS. ""It's part of our job to help the family understand what our laws are about ... "" she said. ""But this department would never, and did not ever, intend to, nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening"" the family over a possible ransom. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters Friday: ""Let me just say that I am really taken aback -- surprised, I guess, is the word, by this comment with respect to the Foley family."" ""I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,"" Kerry told reporters in Turkey, where he was working to build a coalition to battle ISIS. Foley's execution was cited by President Barack Obama this week as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. Even so, Foley's mother, Diane, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that officials asked family members to ""not go to the media."" She said they were told the ""government would not exchange prisoners,"" or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son. ""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, she said in the interview that aired Thursday. ""It didn't seem to be in (U.S.) strategic interest, if you will."" She said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the way the government handled the case. Kerry said he had worked on the effort to free Foley when he was taken hostage in Libya in 2011. ""Everybody is heartbroken that we were not able to do it"" this time, he said. U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could."" Rice also pointed out that hundreds of U.S. personnel were involved in a rescue attempt in Syria to free Foley and others. Official: U.S. attempt to rescue Foley, others in Syria failed . ""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home."" Diane Foley told CNN the location of the hostages was known for more than a year, and the rescue operation came very late. James Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case .

a96943f14cefb56497dbe59e5e23d2aee1c5fe4c,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iraq is raking in more money from oil exports than it is spending, amassing a projected four-year budget surplus of up to $80 billion, U.S. auditors reported Tuesday. Oil accounted for 94 percent of the Iraq's revenue from 2005 to 2007, a U.S. report says. Leading members of Congress, noting that Washington is paying for reconstruction in Iraq, expressed outrage at the assessment. One called the findings ""inexcusable."" ""We should not be paying for Iraqi projects while Iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank, including outrageous profits from $4-a-gallon gas prices in the U.S.,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""We should require that U.S. taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects."" Baghdad had a $29 billion budget surplus between 2005 to 2007. With the price of crude roughly doubling in the past year, Iraq's surplus for 2008 is expected to run between $38 billion and $50 billion, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The United States has put about $48 billion toward reconstruction since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, auditors reported. About $23 billion of that was spent on the oil and electricity industries, water systems and security. Iraq spent $3.9 billion on those sectors from 2005 through April 2008, according to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. The ongoing fighting there, a shortage of trained staff and weak controls have made it difficult for the Iraqi government to spend its surplus on needed projects, the agency's report concluded. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of the slow progress of reconstruction and an advocate of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. His criticism Tuesday was echoed by Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican who is the former chairman and now a leading member of Levin's committee. ""Despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years, U.S. taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of Iraq reconstruction funds,"" Warner said in a joint statement with Levin. ""It is time for the sovereign government of Iraq, using its revenues, expenditures and surpluses, to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people."" In its written response to the audit report, the Treasury Department said U.S. officials are working with Iraqis to address the issue, ""and we believe progress is being made."" ""The report shows Iraq's budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008, but it is equally important to realize that spending in Iraq is also increasing,"" Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Andy Baukol wrote to the GAO. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government submitted a $22 billion supplemental budget to the Iraqi parliament in July, including $8 billion in proposed capital expenditures, Baukol wrote. The issue raised the hackles of several members of Congress earlier this year -- particularly because Bush administration officials said on the eve of the war that Iraqi oil money would pay for reconstruction. In 2003, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told the House Appropriations Committee: ""We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, said Tuesday's report ""is going to make a lot of American families very angry."" ""The record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for Iraq, but the Iraqi government isn't spending the money on rebuilding,"" said Waxman, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Levin spokeswoman Tara Andringa said the senator hopes to tighten rules governing U.S. expenditures on Iraqi reconstruction efforts in the next Pentagon authorization bill. The Iraqi surplus has piled up even though the country's oil production has only recently matched prewar levels, according to the Brookings Institution's latest Iraq Index. The country spent about 80 percent of its $29 billion operating budget in 2007, including public services and salaries, but only 28 percent of its $12 billion investment budget, the GAO found. The export of crude oil accounted for 94 percent of Iraq's revenues from 2005 to 2007, the GAO reported.",3,11.590850929165814
07ecb59767f10217e2d684e697195fb5021781f8,CNN,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Nearly 90 professors at Iran's oldest and largest university signed a letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticizing the government's violent handling of student protesters. ""The issue that has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the devout Muslim and patriots of this land is the violent and above the law [illegal] encounters, particularly with University students and faculty members of this land,"" says the letter, which was posted on the reformist Web site ""Rahesabz,"" or ""Green Path."" ""In fact, the nightly attacks on the dormitories and living quarters of innocent students and daily assaults on them ... are not testaments to the power of the system, just as the violent beatings and imprisonments are not testament to its faith and piety."" The professors ask Khamenei to order revolutionary guards, government-sanctioned militiamen and others who have engaged in campus violence to vacate the university. The letter also calls for official apologies for beatings of university members and the unconditional release of detained students and faculty. There was no immediate government response to the letter. The 88 professors -- all of whom are considered employees of the Islamic republic -- who signed the letter are ""risking their jobs and God knows what else,"" said Ali Alfoneh, a research fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute who has researched the relationship between Iranian civilians and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. ""Some of them may end up arrested,"" he added. The letter, posted on a reformist Web site Monday, is a rare and significant showing of discontent among Tehran University's academics. Student unrest has only increased since thousands of protesters turned out on the streets of Iran to oppose the country's disputed presidential election, in which hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. ""Unfortunately and sadly; all of this takes place under the veil of safeguarding Islam and the representation of the supreme leadership and, even more sadly, no institution or organization accepts responsibility for this savagery!"" The anti-government demonstrations began following the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Last month marked the deadliest clashes since the initial protests broke out this summer. At least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested as they took to the streets on Ashura, a Shiite Muslim holy day. One university researcher told CNN he was one of many beaten by police, struck with a baton 11 times. Iranian Interior Minister Mostafa-Mohammad Najjar warned Saturday that the government will not show leniency to protesters in the future. ""It doesn't surprise me that professors wrote this letter, because universities have been one of the first victims of increased government pressure,"" Alfoneh said. In the aftermath of the election, Tehran University and other institutions quickly became hotbeds of violence, with members of the government's Basij militia attacking young protesters on campus, including dormitories. In August, Khamenei addressed a group of university professors from all over, noting that academics would be held to a higher standard of accountability -- especially after the elections. ""Naturally, the expectations that we have of the professors and faculty is much greater than what we expect from the students,"" Khamenei was quoted by Iranian media as saying on August 30. ""The students are the young officers on the front lines of this war and the professors are the commanders [against] this 'soft war' -- the professors who can fulfill this role will be worthy of the Islamic republic."" The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence. At times, video has shown protesters apparently turning on security forces. Still, the letter serves as another blow to Iran's Islamic leadership, which reformists say has lost credibility in its handling of the post-election unrest. Several critics, including cleric and former presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi have compared the tactics of the current government to those of the Shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the same fervent followers of Islam more than 30 years ago. Alfoneh noted that numerous petitions were drafted and published in the days leading up to the overthrow of the Shah, who was also slammed with allegations of injustice and human rights violations under his watch. He said it's no surprise that academics today are taking a similar approach as it becomes increasingly harder to teach amid the violence. ""The opposition and even ordinary citizen are trying to duplicate the events of 30 years ago -- they're trying to play to the memory of the public,"" Alfoneh said.

ba887f67e76339d299ee0ebb17db9669a4b35053,CNN,"(CNN) -- In signing Argentina's same-sex marriage law, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said debate over the issue would be ""absolutely anachronistic"" -- archaic, out of date -- within a few years. Striking down California's Proposition 8 two weeks later, Judge Vaughn Walker was more specific, saying there was no evidence for old-fashioned stereotypes that painted gays ""as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality."" Banning people from marrying based on sexual orientation, the President Reagan appointee explained, is ""irrational."" ""Often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now,"" said Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book, ""Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans' Definitions of Family."" As Walker indicated, attitudes are changing, and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children, defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society. ""Public attitudes don't change really quickly, but this is one that's changing really, really quickly,"" Powell said. The trend is similar abroad, especially among younger people, said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who heads the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including Jamaica, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Ivory Coast. Research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as ""benign variation, so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting,"" Goldberg said in an e-mail. ""Once that happens, societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples,"" she added. Before 2008, Massachusetts (via a court ruling) was the only U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada and South Africa were the only countries. Since then, four U.S. states, five countries, Washington, D.C., and Mexico City have legalized same-sex marriage. Watch why same-sex marriages are on hold in California . While some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights, some may appear more curious. South Africa resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights, and in some African countries same-sex relationships are punishable by penal labor, flogging, imprisonment or death, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association. Mexico City, Portugal and Argentina, all of which legalized same-sex marriage this year -- and Spain, which OK'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly Catholic, and the church has made clear its aversion to same-sex relationships. Goldberg said she believes, in the Catholic countries, the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality. ""My sense is that the shift in the Catholic countries to recognize same sex-couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been, in some nations, an indication of the church's shrinking political clout,"" she said. Argentina may fit the bill, as the country is 92 percent Roman Catholic, yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing. Watch couple comment on Argentina's first same-sex marriage . A recent CNN poll said Americans were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. Proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, but Powell noted referendums ""do not necessarily reflect the will of the people."" Older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks, he said, and heated issues draw special interests into elections, which can skew demographics. Powell has been collecting data on American attitudes since 2003. While the full data will be released in his book in September, his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers: Though many Americans simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families, 80 percent of Americans consider gay partners a family if they have children. His research shows American definitions of family are becoming flexible, he said, likening the same-sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision authorizing interracial marriages. Before the miscegenation ruling, researchers found younger people, those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages. Similar lines hold true in today's same-sex marriage debate. Powell added another variable: gender. Women have a ""more inclusive"" definition of family, he said. Goldberg said demographics were also at play in other nations, ""reaching a tipping point"" on same-sex couples. These societies have had long-standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work, in courts and elsewhere, she said. iReport.com: 'Army of lovers' fights for rights . There is also ""an increased demand by same-sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion-based reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marriage,"" she said. The more open discourse on a topic, the more acceptance it garners, Goldberg and Powell concurred. Look to the tube. When Ellen DeGeneres kissed Laura Dern on her sitcom, ""Ellen,"" in 1997, there was enormous backlash. Today, same-sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters, such as ""Modern Family"" and ""Glee,"" are up for Emmys this month. ""Once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases, as a result of media representations, people become more comfortable,"" Powell said. Added Goldberg, ""It's also true that as gay people live openly and as same-sex couples' relationships are recognized more broadly, fears that the sky will fall because of same-sex couples' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream."" Change is not swift everywhere, as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut. Read Time.com's history of international gay marriage . In 2008, the U.N. General Assembly saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians, yet a 2010 International Lesbian and Gay Association report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation. The number last year was 77. India dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in July 2009. ""One country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress, until one realizes that it hosts one-sixth of the human population,"" the report said. There are countries such as Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior, according to the report. There are places such as Aruba and Israel that will recognize same-sex marriages but won't perform them. There are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions. Goldberg said policies in Uganda, which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment, and in Iran are stark contrasts to the rest of the world, which is reluctant to condemn gays openly. As for countries embracing civil unions, it's a compromise, Powell said. People are in favor of many gay rights, just not marriage, he said. Goldberg described it as ""typically political, where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same-sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community."" To those fighting for gay rights, Powell said, any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people's comfort levels. ""Contact makes things less scary, makes it more comfortable, and the more comfort you have the less opposition you're going to have,"" he said.",1,11.153054416695538
01320e7d24406f4c858dbb205e3582681f621c31,CNN,"(CNN) -- Myanmar's Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to overturn her house arrest. A diplomat who attended the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the appeal was unsuccessful. Suu Kyi, 64, has one final avenue for appeal to a special court in Myanmar's new capital, Naypidaw. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's house arrest was extended by 18 months last August after an incident in which uninvited American John Yettaw stayed at her lakeside home. Myanmar's ruling military junta accused Suu Kyi of breaching the terms of her house arrest. She has been imprisoned or under house arrest for much of the past two decades, since her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990. The junta has never recognized the results, but has promised to hold fresh elections this year, although no date has yet been set. Suu Kyi is disqualified from standing because she was married to a foreigner. The NLD has still to clarify whether it will participate in the vote.

8fc0d0266d9cc6266a1ca8af653fb32141503b33,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tony Dorsett recalls a 1984 game against the Philadelphia Eagles when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him. One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. ""He blew me up,"" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit."" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football . However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the ""holy grail"" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. ""We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,"" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. ""This is very, very preliminary,"" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. ""There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?"" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. ""Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,"" he said. ""Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there."" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL . Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. ""And I say who are you? What are you becoming?"" he said. ""It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato."" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players . Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. ""I'm going to beat this. Trust me,"" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a $765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. ""I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way."" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. NFL concussion settlement raises questions .",8,5.768829510414406
8b5644172615314e781931ebd18c7fcefd27e7bf,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Congolese rebels seized a major military camp and a spacious gorilla park in a renewed bout of heavy fighting that sent thousands fleeing, according to the United Nations and park officials. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga Park, which was taken over Sunday by rebels fighting army forces. The fighting comes after a tenuous week-old U.N. brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces fell apart Sunday. Fighting between the rebels under renegade Gen. Laurent Nkunda and Congolese army regulars in the eastern province of North Kivu of the Democratic Republic of the Congo displaced thousands of civilians, according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux. The rebels also seized the headquarters of Virunga National Park in eastern Congo after intense fighting with the Congolese army, according to a statement by park officials. The rebels have used Virunga Park as a base but have never seized its headquarters before. The 3,000 square mile (7,800 square kilometer) park has a gorilla facility and is home to 200 of the 700 endangered mountain gorillas in existence. ""Over 50 rangers were forced to flee into the forests and abandon the park station, in fear of their lives,"" the park statement said. ""They have seized the entire gigantic infrastructure [of the park headquarters] which is stategically very close to the main road heading north into Goma,"" said park spokeswoman Samantha Newport by phone from Goma, about 40 kilometers from the fighting. ""The situation is eastern Congo is very dangerous,"" she said. ""It's the first time they've [rebels] ever had the audacity"" to take over the park.   Watch as park ranger describes the violence as it explodes behind him » . Newport said the rebels have set up roadblocks so the rangers are making their way through woods south to safety. She said the gorillas and other wildlife in the park are in danger of getting caught in the crossfire. A park ranger described the takeover. ""When the rebels started approaching the park station we thought we were all going to be killed,"" said Park Ranger Bareke Sekibibi, 29, who spoke by cell phone from the forest earlier as he fled, according to the park statement. "" We are not military combatants, we are park rangers protecting Virunga's wildlife."" Although the civil war in the Congo officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and rebels has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes . The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of some 5.4 million people since 1998, and that 45,000 people continue to die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January.",7,8.78536033156414
96593168910c9c60d3b19c71c634a308483aa230,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- NASA announced Tuesday the new retirement homes for the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program's test vehicle. The space shuttle Atlantis will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida; the Endeavour, at the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Discovery, at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia; and the test shuttle, Enterprise, at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York, NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr. said during a ceremony at the Kennedy Center. The announcement was made on the 30th anniversary of the space shuttle program's first flight, made by the subsequently ill-fated Columbia orbiter, and the 50th anniversary of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space. More than 20 locations around the country sought one of the orbiters because of the potential tourist draw. The drama mirrored the bidding to host an Olympic games. Supporters of sites that were rejected expressed disappointment. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the Johnson Space Center in Houston should have been one of the retirement homes for an orbiter, ""but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet,"" he said in a statement. He noted that Houston ""played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle."" ""Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the space shuttle orbiters,"" Cornyn said. ""There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters -- even Administrator Bolden stated as much. Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the state of Texas, and I'm deeply disappointed with the administration's misguided decision,"" Cornyn said. In Los Angeles, shortly after NASA's announcement, California Science Center President Jeffrey Rudolph told reporters that the Endeavour would boost the center's annual 1.4 million visitors to about 2 million people a year. The center plans to use the orbiter as the centerpiece to a new air and space gallery, which would cost $200 million and is part of the center's 25-year master plan, Rudolph said. That price tag includes the $28.8 million that the center must pay NASA to prepare and relocate the orbiter to Los Angeles, he said. The center hasn't hired an architect yet to design the new facility and is now planning a fundraiser, he said. ""Obviously, we were thrilled. We got the word this morning, shortly before the announcement,"" Rudolph said of his reaction to winning one of the shuttles. ""The fact that the shuttle was created here in California had a lot to do with giving us a leg up"" over the competition, Rudolph said. ""It's a fitting place for this national treasure."" The center, which also features a Los Angeles charter school, is the most attended museum in southern California and one of the most attended in the country, Rudolph said. The Los Angeles center's existing air and space gallery is now home to the Mercury-Redstone 2 capsule that carried Ham, a chimpanzee, on a suborbital flight, and the Gemini 11 capsule flown by astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on an orbital flight. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- both California Democrats -- wrote to NASA's Bolden last year asking that California become home to one of the shuttles because the state has a long history with the shuttle program. Beginning in 1972, all five space shuttle orbiters were fabricated in Downey, California, and assembled in Palmdale, California, Boxer said in a statement. All of the space shuttles were tested at Edwards Air Force Base just outside of Palmdale, where 53 of NASA's 133 shuttle missions landed, she said. The Endeavour will take its final flight on April 29, and prior to this launch, it will have been used on 24 missions, orbited the earth 4,429 times and traveled 103,149,636 miles, Boxer said. ""California has a long history of supporting the shuttle program and we are proud to welcome this inspiring symbol of American scientific achievement and ingenuity to the Golden State,"" Boxer said in a statement. Audience members at the Kennedy Space Center cheered when Bolden announced the Atlantis would be assigned to that launch facility. Many people in the gallery were center workers, some of whom are likely to lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends. Because the announcement was being made at Kennedy, expectations were high that the visitor center would be awarded one of the shuttles. The Atlantis will fly the last planned shuttle mission in June, NASA said. The Museum of Flight in Seattle also wanted one. In fact, one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed was already erected in anticipation. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the museum's president, Doug King, said museum officials didn't have any inside information. ""I think that confident may be too strong a word. I think that hopeful is probably a better one,"" he said. But on Tuesday, Washington state Gov. Chris Gregoire also said she was disappointed that the NASA didn't select the Seattle museum for one of the retired shuttles. ""The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit,"" Gregoire said in a statement. ""However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home,"" the governor said. ""The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get. Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum."" Facilities in Chicago, New York, Dayton, Ohio, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, also put in requests for an orbiter, with hopes that such a historic artifact would inspire countless children in those areas to explore careers in science and engineering. Becoming home to an orbiter promises to be a boon for a community. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year. The economic impact to the area is estimated at about $15 million. At New York's Intrepid Museum, Executive Director Susan Marenoff told CNN, ""Figure over 300,000 people additional (due) to the Intrepid, to New York City. Couple that with $106 million in economic benefit. We think that's a pretty good deal."" Each winning location has to fork over $28.8 million to NASA for delivery of the vehicles. They also must guarantee a climate-controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle. That's still a bargain, officials at the bidding locations said, because of the return on investment they expect. One of the orbiters -- Discovery, the oldest -- was largely regarded as being Smithsonian-bound. That was confirmed by Tuesday's announcement. The Enterprise, a test shuttle that never flew in space, is there now. It was be reassigned, at a discounted price, to one of the locations that didn't get either Endeavour or Atlantis. That location turned out to be the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. Only two more shuttle flights are scheduled: Endeavour on April 29 and Atlantis on June 28, wrapping up a program in which the vehicles launched satellites, built a space station, and launched and repaired an orbiting telescope. After that, they become museum pieces. Two other shuttles were destroyed in flight accidents. The Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on January 28, 1986, and the Columbia disintegrated during re-entry on February 1, 2003.

df35df38ce435e5b3fa77fa0d504523fe36ea1ff,CNN,"(CNN) -- Philip Chism, the Massachusetts teenager accused of raping and killing his algebra teacher, became visibly upset when the teacher, Colleen Ritzer, spoke about the teen's home state of Tennessee after class, according to a police affidavit unsealed Friday. A ninth grade student told investigators that she was in class with Chism and Ritzer after school on the day of the crime, the affidavit said. She said the teacher and Chism were talking about China but, at some point, Ritzer mentioned the student's home state of Tennessee. Chism became ""visibly upset,"" the student said. When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset, she changed the subject, said the unidentified student, who described Chism as ""talking to himself."" The affidavit, in chilling detail, offers the first hint of a possible motive in last month's gruesome killing of the popular high school teacher. Ritzer, 24, was allegedly raped with an object and had her throat slashed. A handwritten note found next to her body said, ""I hate you all."" A Massachusetts grand jury on Thursday indicted Chism, 14, on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with Ritzer's slaying on October 22, according to the Essex district attorney. Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism be tried in an adult court. ""The indictments ... detail horrific and unspeakable acts,"" District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, declined to comment. The affidavit includes testimony from eyewitnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher's final moments. In the video, Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls restroom -- apparently a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism, wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head, appears to enter the restroom about a minute later, according to the affidavit. Shortly after, a female student enters the bathroom and quickly walks out, according to court papers. She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes. The person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor. The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say. He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot. Investigators said there are what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom as well as on Chism's pants in the video. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. The affidavit said that when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife. A search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of woman's underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said. Her throat was slit. The green recycling bin seen in the surveillance video was found 20 yards from the body. Clothing and other belongings were scattered near the body, along with blood soaked gloves Chism appeared to be wearing in the video. The handwritten ""I hate you all"" note was folded near her body, according to the documents. Investigators used the affidavit to secure a warrant to search Chism's home. Chism's mother, Diana, told investigators that she recently moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee amid a ""stressful divorce"" from the teen's father. Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago shed light on a troubled relationship. The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of ""prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."" Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN in the days after the crime that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her ""heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer."" The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism, armed with a box cutter, robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. On the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they will move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court. ""This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family,"" Blodgett said. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . Ritzer was known to her friends and family as a woman who inspired many -- whether in the classroom or online -- with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. ""She was happy,"" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. ""I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."" A 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, Ritzer seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. Dressed in pink, hundreds mourn Colleen Ritzer, slain Massachusetts teacher . ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" The Ritzer family released a statement saying: ""We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen."" A week after the slaying, about 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects at the church where the family of popular math teacher worshiped.",1,6.795441741570422

""The Islamists ordered the people to leave the area before they started smashing the tombs,"" Mayor Ousmane Halle said. ""I saw both members of Ansar Dine and MUJAO, another Islamic faction in charge of the city. They were heavily armed and people had no choice but to leave when they started destroying the shrines.""

Or perhaps you just want to visit London to celebrate the upcoming birth of royalty (the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William are expecting their bundle of joy any day now). Either way, we've got you covered. Here are nine spots in the British capital that will have you living it up like a royal in no time: . Bask in luxury: Draycott Hotel . Check-in at this five-star hotel begins with sparkling cider for mommy-to-be and some bubbly for the frazzled dad-to-be, not to mention a bouquet of roses. Settle into your room before heading to your prenatal massage, included in the Royal Babymoon package. Don't worry: The Draycott has thought of everything, including a cuddly teddy bear for the newborn, extra pillows and parenting magazines. Don't forget to sip some tea at 4 p.m. (it's on the house), traipse through the private garden and settle down for hot chocolate and homemade biscuits (also on the house) at 9:30 p.m. Ice cream cravings? They've got that covered, too, with nightly room delivery of strawberry, chocolate or vanilla. 26 Cadogan Gardens, London . Act like royalty: The Goring . The Goring is most famous for the fact that Kate stayed there her last night as a single lady before the royal wedding. It was also the venue for the reception after-party. The Goring has welcomed Royals since 1910. Even the queen of England holds her annual summer garden party there. And why not? This hotel is said to have the largest private garden in London. With the stamp of approval from Kate and company (aka a royal warrant from the queen herself), you can rest assured you will feel perfectly regal, too. The Goring, Beeston Place, London . Indulge in some retail therapy: St. Martin's Courtyard . There's nothing like having a personal stylist dress you to the nines, especially when she takes you on a sartorial tour through the heart of Covent Garden, one of London's most fashionable neighborhoods. Book a half day with Eliisa Makin, the wardrobe consultant at St. Martin's Courtyard, to find all the trappings of a great wardrobe, including L.K. Bennett and Barbour, two labels Kate has been seen wearing. (Note: Ask Makin to take you to King's Road, too. Perhaps you'll land yourself a Kate sighting.) Makin, a stylist and fashion editor, will take you to lunch to discuss the looks you are after and then dress you from head to toe in the season's trends. There's plenty of ground to cover with a mix of fashion, beauty and lifestyle boutiques, including Sienna Miller's label Twenty8Twelve, Jaeger London and Cos. Slingsby Place, London . Breathe in, breathe out: Tri-Yoga . Bring on the harmony with a visit to this popular yoga studio with various locations throughout London. Besides offering a slew of classes (vinyasa, ashtanga and aerial yoga), there are treatments that will further put any expecting couple at ease. Ladies can opt for pregnancy craniosacral therapy, reflexology or acupuncture; gentlemen will dig the sports massage or the Thai foot massage. And if you're up for some extra credit, the studio also runs workshops for couples who are expecting, including topics such as hypnobreathing, emotional detox and postnatal restorative techniques. After working up an appetite, stop by the on-site cafe for raw carrot cake bites, filling salads, smoothies and juices. There's even a pregnancy drink (packed with apple, pear, kiwi and spinach) said to give mother and baby an extra wallop of nutrients. Picnic in the park: Hyde Park . What once was a place for King Henry VIII and his court to hunt deer and wild boar in the 16th century is now a refuge for tai chi, swimming and kicking back.

c6f17e5ec10ffaed02b111f02af4afa86d347d3e,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods may have clung on to his world number one status but after a disappointing final round at the PGA Championship will have to rely on captain Corey Pavin to play in the Ryder Cup. Woods needed to finish in the top 15 at Whistling Straits to have any chance of forcing his way into the eight automatic selections for the United States team to face Europe at Celtic Manor in October. Handily placed after three rounds, Woods stumbled to a one-over 73 to end up in a tie for 28th. ""I hit my irons really good today. I drove it terrible,"" was his verdict. His performance was certainly an improvement on a disastrous showing in the preceding WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and Woods briefly led at the start of his first round, but after that the inconsistencies crept in. ""I didn't miss a shot for the first four holes. And then after that I hit it awful,"" he added. Woods could have done with replicating the final round 67 of arch-rival Phil Mickelson, which lifted him into a tie for 12th, but not enough to surpass his fellow American in the rankings. Woods is now hoping that U.S. captain Corey Pavin will make him one of his four captain's picks. ""Corey texts me a lot so, I'm sure he'll be texting me or calling me and I'm sure we'll be talking. ""We still have what, two more weeks, right? Two more weeks before the picks? Three more weeks?"" Woods is still searching for his first win of a truncated season and has not claimed a major since the U.S. Open in 2008. Consolation for runner-up Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson, who was penalized two shots to miss out on the playoff, comes as they have moved into the automatic eight spots. Germany's Martin Kaymer has sealed his place in the Europe team after his first major victory, while Paul Casey, who tied 12th, has also forced his way into the nine automatic selection spots. It leaves Luke Donald, Padraig Harrington and Justin Rose now requiring picks from captain Colin Montgomerie, but Sergio Garcia's decision to take a break from golf has made his decision a little easier.",7,9.383229827056441
21dfd18850a1bba004b513e770f8c1604151ed9c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The United States breached international law by executing a Mexican national without having granted him consular access, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday. Navi Pillay, in a statement, said she deeply regrets the execution of Humberto Leal Garcia, after a 5-4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court denied him a stay of execution Thursday night. ""The execution of Mr. Leal Garcia places the U.S. in breach of international law,"" said Pillay, who is on an official mission in Mexico. ""What the state of Texas has done in this case is imputable in law to the U.S. and engages the United States' international responsibility."" Pillay said Leal was not granted consular access, which -- as a foreign national -- was his right under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The denial of access raises concerns about whether Leal got a fair trial, Pillay said. Leal, who was convicted for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl, was executed Thursday evening by lethal injection in Texas. Federal officials, including the Obama administration, had tried to persuade Texas Gov. Rick Perry to delay the execution. ""The secretary herself is quite disappointed in the outcome in this case,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Neuland about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""The U.S. government sought a stay of Leal's execution in order to give the Congress time to act on the Consular Notification Compliance Act, which would have provided Leal the judicial review required by international law."" Neuland said the case underscores the importance of the act's passage. ""If we don't protect the rights of non-Americans in the United States, we seriously risk reciprocal lack of access to our own citizens overseas,"" she said. ""I am sorry for everything I have done,"" Leal said at the Huntsville facility before he was executed. ""I have hurt a lot of people. Let this be final and be done. I take the full blame for this."" Leal then shouted ""Viva Mexico,"" followed by ""I'm ready warden, let's get the show on the road."" Mexico condemned the execution, saying it violated an International Court of Justice ruling ordering the United States to review capital convictions of Mexican nationals. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier denied a stay of execution by 5-4, despite pleas from the Obama administration and the Mexican government to delay the execution. In an unsigned opinion by the majority, the court refused to delay the execution until Congress could pass pending legislation giving federal courts the authority to hear similar claims from foreign inmates. ""We decline to follow the United States' suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success,"" said the majority. In their dissent, the four justices, led by Stephen Breyer, urged that Leal's execution be delayed. ""It is difficult to see how the state's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer,"" said Breyer, who was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Sandra Babcock, lead appellate attorney, said, ""It is shameful that Mr. Leal will pay the price for our inaction. The need for congressional action to restore our reputation and protect our citizens is more urgent than ever."" ""This case was not just about one Mexican national on death row in Texas,"" Babcock said in a statement. ""The execution of Mr. Leal violates the United States' treaty commitments, threatens the nation's foreign policy interests, and undermines the safety of all Americans abroad."" The state's Board of Pardons and Parole ruled that Leal did not deserve to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole. The victim's mother, Rachel Terry, had called for the execution to go ahead as planned. ""A technicality doesn't give anyone a right to come to this country and rape, torture and murder anyone, in this case my daughter,"" she told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio. ""It's been difficult for myself and her family members,"" she added. ""She certainly was taken away from us at a very young age. We just want closure."" Leal's lawyers argued the consulate access violation was more than a technicality. Babcock told CNN that Mexican officials would have ensured Leal would have had the most competent trial defense possible had they been able to speak with him immediately after he was arrested. ""I think in most of these cases it was not a deliberate thing,"" Babcock said. ""Local police lack training"" on the Vienna Convention, she added, referring to the international agreement that mandates consular access. Leal's backers say he had learning disabilities and brain damage and had been sexually abused by his parish priest. They say those factors should have been considered at his sentencing. The Mexican government had filed a supporting appeal with the high court in Washington, asking the justices to block Leal's execution. And on Friday, the Obama administration asked Texas to delay the execution. ""This case implicates United States foreign policy interests of the highest order,"" including protecting U.S. citizens abroad and promoting good relations with other countries, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said. Congress has also weighed in. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill in June to grant federal courts the power to review such appeals. ""This case is not an isolated instance; the issue of consular notification remains a serious diplomatic and legal concern,"" Leahy said Thursday. In Texas, Perry's office countered that a federal appeals court had already given Leal the judicial scrutiny the Obama administration and the United Nations were seeking. ""If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws,"" Katherine Cesinger, spokeswoman for the governor, told CNN. ""Congress has had the opportunity to consider and pass legislation for the federal courts' review of such cases since 2008, and has not done so each time a bill was filed."" Ted Cruz, the state's former solicitor general who argued the 2008 Supreme Court case for Texas, said Leal waited too long to raise these issues. ""The question is not should a foreign national have the right to contact their consulate,"" Cruz told CNN. ""The question is, years later, after they have been tried, after they have been convicted, after it has been clear like Humberto Leal that they are a vicious child rapist and murderer, should you come in and set aside that conviction. You can't come back years later and try and set aside your trial with some additional claim you wish you had raised."" Cruz is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican candidate.",1,7.424498009780431
6c3c5e101bf39fd0c0696a19308d6ead718576d9,CNN,"Boulder City, Nevada (CNN) -- Driving across the stark Nevada desert at 75 miles an hour, you don't expect to find much. Craggy mountains tower above scrubby brown plains with only hints of scattered green. Sometimes, a tumbleweed, like a lost extra from an old Western movie, skips across the road. Then, off in the distance, I see something shiny. More than shiny; it is positively gleaming. This is my first glimpse of what is billed as the largest solar cell field in the country. It is hard to say if the claim is true, since these things are being built so quickly in so many places now. But it is impressive: row after row after row of black glass panels tilted toward the sun, quietly soaking energy from the sky. ""Right now, we have about a million panels,"" says Scott Crider with Sempra Energy, a California-based energy resources company. ""This facility will power about 14,000 average homes on an annual basis."" And that's just the start. Sempra has big designs on being a major player in the green energy game. But as the wind whips through my hair and I study the immense emptiness all around, I can't help but ask, ""Why is this such a good location for such a thing?"" ""First, there is a lot of available, flat land,"" Crider says. ""Second, it is incredibly sunny. This region gets about 330 days of sunshine per year. And third, there's existing transmission lines which provide access to major markets throughout the western United States."" Which, as is so often the case, raises another question: Why are those lines way out here? To find that answer, you have to drive 20 minutes to struggling Boulder City, population about 16,000. The town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology; during another time when the economy and energy collided; when thousands of jobless men came here during the Great Depression to undertake an unprecedented power-generating project. ""This town is here because it was a federal reservation to build Hoover Dam."" That's Duncan McCoy. He's a member of the city council and has a background in history. He has watched his town get hammered by the recession. Tourists aren't coming to the dam just east of town like they once did. The value of local houses has plunged. ""Our local sales tax revenue is down,"" he says, shaking his head. ""That's a major portion of our budget. Our property tax revenues are down."" But bring up the solar facility and he brightens, because it has opened a gateway from his town's past into the future. The solar plant provided several hundred temporary construction jobs when it was built, and it has created a handful of permanent positions, since. More importantly, it is bringing desperately needed money to city coffers. Fifteen years ago, the town bought up vast amounts of land to protect itself from the sprawling reach of neighboring Las Vegas. As luck would have it, the purchase included all the land around the big transmission lines leading to the dam, and now, they are leasing that property to Sempra and others who want to tap into them. ""This year, we'll get about two-and-a-half million dollars. That's about 11 percent of our city's general fund budget,"" McCoy says. ""That's pretty important money, and we can count on it."" They can probably count on more as well. Back at the solar field, Crider makes it clear that this is only the start. ""There is strong demand for cleaner sources of energy, and we're going to help fill that niche."" Sempra is not alone. Nevada is aggressively courting more solar firms, convinced that if they can get enough into place, the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state California. Of course, other states such as Arizona and New Mexico are thinking the same thing. For the folks in Boulder City, however, that's a worry for another day. They know their dark days are far from past. But right now, the sun is shining, and just as it was when they built the dam so long ago, that's a start.",2,11.546671660810516
4f4166636514bc614fc138a2484313235a05a239,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama signed legislation providing an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to the Pakistani government. President Obama signs the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 in the Oval Office on Thursday. The aid guarantee comes as the Pakistani government combats a wave of attacks believed to have been orchestrated by Taliban militants and as the Obama administration works on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. ""This law is the tangible manifestation of broad support for Pakistan in the U.S.,"" the White House said in a statement on Thursday. The act bolsters a partnership ""based on a shared commitment to improving the living conditions of the people of Pakistan through sustainable economic development, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and combating the extremism that threatens Pakistan and the United States,"" it said. On Wednesday, the heads of foreign relations panels in the House of Representatives and Senate provided a written explanation of the aid bill, a response to Pakistani complaints that the United States was meddling in its affairs. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi joined Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Rep. Howard Berman, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as the U.S. lawmakers spoke to reporters. Qureshi rushed back to Washington this week to report on opposition inside the Pakistani Parliament to the five-year package of nonmilitary aid. Some Pakistani politicians said the aid bill was a U.S. attempt to micromanage Pakistan's civilian and military affairs. ""Everyone is on the same page,"" Kerry said. ""We are all clear about the intentions of the legislation."" Kerry argued the bill ""demonstrates the American people have a long-term commitment to the people of Pakistan."" Qureshi replied, ""This document, which I think is an historic document, is a step forward in our relationship."" Kerry said the explanatory statement attached to the bill emphasizes that no interference is intended with Pakistan's civilian or military operations. The statement said the bill establishes a variety of requirements meant to ensure U.S. efficiency and compliance but places no new conditions on the Pakistani government. ""The many requirements of this report are intended as a way for Congress to assess how effectively U.S. funds are being spent, shortfalls in U.S. resources that hinder the use of such funds and steps the government of Pakistan has taken to advance our mutual interests in countering extremism and nuclear proliferation and strengthening democratic institutions,"" the statement said. ""There is no intent to [establish], and nothing in this act in any way suggests that there should be, any U.S. role in micromanaging internal Pakistani affairs, including the promotion of Pakistani military officers or the internal operations of the Pakistani military."" Berman said the statement is ""a reflection of our desire to be long-term partners with the Pakistan people."" Relations between the two governments, however, are being tested by new violence in Pakistan. On Thursday, militants launched a string of attacks that killed at least 30 Pakistani police officers and civilians, Pakistani authorities said. At least 10 attackers also died, while others were missing.  Watch a rundown of the day's violence » . Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Pakistani Taliban accepted blame for three attacks Thursday against two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore. About a half hour after the trio of attacks, a suicide car bomber hit a police station in the Kohat district of northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 11 people -- eight civilians and three police, said Kohat Police Chief Dilawar Bangish. A dozen people were wounded. In a fifth attack, in Peshawar, a remote control bomb exploded inside a car parked in front of an apartment building. A hospital official said an 8-year-old boy was killed, and eight people -- four women, two men and two children -- were wounded. At least 41 people were killed and 45 were wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan. The explosion occurred in the Shangla district in the volatile Swat Valley. The attacks show ""once again that the militants in Pakistan threaten both Pakistan and the United States,"" White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton said Thursday. Obama ""has been impressed by some of the courageous actions that the Pakistani military has taken to root out some of these extremist elements,"" he added.

1aca8b5b26a6f608ca00de604bf104f672a18e86,CNN,"(CNN) -- A Texas judge denied a Planned Parenthood request for a temporary restraining order Monday that would have extended the organization's ability to participate in the state's revamped Women's Health Program. A law going into effect Tuesday requires the state to fully fund women's health clinics with the exception of those that are affiliated with abortion providers. Previously, such establishments obtained 90% of their money through the Social Security Administration and other federal funding. Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics, and fellow plaintiff Marcela Balquinta of McAllen, Texas, had filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law, arguing the organization provides preventative women's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 Texas enrollees annually. ""I have denied the request for a temporary restraining order at this time,"" Judge Gary Harger said. ""I did not find that there would be an irreparable harm in waiting nine days for the injunction hearing."" A full hearing is scheduled for January 11 before U.S. District Judge Stephen Yelenosky on whether to grant Planned Parenthood a temporary injunction. Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement welcoming the move. ""Today's ruling finally clears the way for thousands of low-income Texas women to access much-needed care, while at the same time respecting the values and laws of our state,"" he said. ""I applaud all those who stand ready to help these women live healthy lives without sending taxpayer money to abortion providers and their affiliates."" With the temporary restraining order denial, women may not be able to access care through the Texas Women's Health Program at Planned Parenthood clinics, pending the result of the January 11 hearing. ""It is shocking that once again Texas officials are letting politics jeopardize health care access for women,"" said Ken S. Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. ""This case isn't about Planned Parenthood -- it's about women like Marcy Balquinta who rely on us for basic, preventive health care."" He added, ""Regardless of what happens in the courts, Planned Parenthood will be here for our patients. Our doors remain open today and always to Texas women in need.

d3f76c790c23e38808d71bbe126d515a265a2f4e,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The City Council of Fullerton, California, approved Tuesday evening the hiring of an independent consultant to reform the city's police force and review last month's arrest and subsequent death of a homeless schizophrenic man, a spokeswoman said. Before a gallery of residents angry about the death, the council voted 5-0 to award a one-year $50,000 contract to Michael J. Gennaco, a consultant whose rate is $260 an hour, to examine the police department's policies and practices, city spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick said. The council then approved 4-1 a second contract, also for up to a year, paying Gennaco $30,000 to prepare a public report looking at the July 5 incident involving police and the death of Kelly Thomas, Mudrick said. Gennaco told the council he will begin investigating the death after the Orange County District Attorney's office completes its own inquiry into the incident, Mudrick said. Gennaco is currently chief attorney for a civilian oversight committee created by the Los Angeles County supervisors to monitor the sheriff's department. Thomas, 37, died five days after what the Orange County district attorney has called ""a violent and desperate struggle"" last month with Fullerton police. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles attorney said he is planning to file a police brutality lawsuit in federal court this week against Fullerton officers in a new unrelated case. But one of the officers in that case was also involved in the Thomas arrest, said the attorney, Garo Mardirossian. Mardirossian is also representing Thomas' father, Ron, who is alleging that his son was a victim of police brutality and has notified Fullerton city officials that he plans to pursue legal action against them. In the second alleged instance of police brutality, Veth Mam, 31, of Orange County, California, had an altercation with Fullerton police officers in October that was recorded on his iPhone and posted on YouTube. Mam wasn't seriously injured, Mardirossian said. Mam, who works in an automation factory, was acquitted of battery against an officer and resisting arrest -- both misdemeanors -- last month, Mardirossian said. On Tuesday, acting Fullerton police chief Kevin Hamilton, named to the post last week, said he was concerned about the Mam case based upon information brought to his attention. He has ordered an internal affairs investigation ""to determine what happened that evening in October 2010 and the court case this year,"" said police spokesman Sgt. Andrew Goodrich . ""There is a strong possibility that we arrested the wrong person that night (Veth Mam),"" Goodrich said in an e-mail to CNN. Mardirossian claims the iPhone video by Mam contradicted the police report and an officer's testimony in the case. How Fullerton police officers write their reports is also a matter of controversy in the Thomas case because officers were allowed to view a videotape of the Thomas arrest before filing their reports, Mardirossian said Tuesday. In the federal lawsuit to be filed later this week, Mam will claim conspiracy to falsify arrest reports, conspiracy to violate the civil rights of a citizen and police brutality, Mardirossian said. Mardirossian said the suit will support his claim that the Fullerton Police Department engages in a ""pattern or practice"" of civil rights violations. Fullerton Deputy City Attorney James Touchstone declined to comment Tuesday on the anticipated legal actions by Thomas' father and by Mam. Touchstone and police spokesman Goodrich also declined to comment on Mardirossian's accusation that one Fullerton police officer was also involved in both cases. Mardirossian identified that officer, but city officials declined to confirm the name Tuesday. The attorney for the six officers didn't return phone calls Tuesday. Meanwhile, Thomas' father and some angry residents have been pressing city officials to release a videotape of the six Fullerton police officers engaged in the arrest and alleged beating. City officials have declined to release the tape. In the July 5 incident, six officers responded to reports that a man was trying to break into cars near a bus depot, according to police. The officers have been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave, and city officials haven't released their names. Police Chief Michael Sellers has also taken a paid medical leave, as two of the city's five council members have called upon him to resign. Gennaco has said he will look at how Fullerton police officers wrote their reports only after watching the videotape. He said police departments have different policies on whether officers can look at their tapes before writing their reports. Gennaco said taxpayers could expect police ""reform"" out of his work. Meanwhile, there are two external investigations into the death, by the FBI and the Orange County district attorney's office. The FBI is looking at civil rights violations. Also, residents notified the city that they are going to start a recall petition drive for the other three members on the city council: Mayor F. Richard Jones, Mayor Pro Tem Don Bankhead and Councilman Pat McKinley. The mayor and mayor pro tem positions are one-year terms rotated among the five council members, officials said.

fcd1bfcff11204aa87c525ffc9e084b30cdadb20,CNN,"(CNN) -- The evolution of Tamerlan Tsarnaev from aspiring Olympic boxer to apparent radical jihadist may have been influenced by a friend in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""This person just took his brain. He just brainwashed him completely,"" Tsarnaev's uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, told CNN from his home in Maryland, describing the friend as an Armenian convert to Islam. While Tsarni did not give the friend's name, The Associated Press reported that other members of Tsarnaev's family said the friend goes by the name ""Misha."" Asked about those reports, Elmirza Khozhgov, a former brother-in-law of Tsarnaev, told CNN Tsarnaev once introduced him to someone by that name who was an Armenian convert. He said he was not told Misha's full name. ""It seemed to me that Misha had influence on Tamerlan,"" apparently encouraging him to give up boxing because it ""is violent,"" Khozhgov told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Tamerlan told me that he quit boxing and music because Misha was teaching that it's not good in Islam to do those things."" ""Misha"" taught Tsarnaev ""things that would make Tamerlan go away from the people and go more into the religion,"" Khozhgov said, but ""I didn't witness him making him radical."" Khozhgov added that he has not spoken with Tsarnaev or with the younger suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, since 2010. And even then, ""We didn't talk for a long time."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev ""seemed normal"" at the time, he added. ""He only told me he goes to the mosque often and he's doing community work at the mosque."" Officials have not responded to requests for comment on someone named ""Misha."" Lawmakers briefed Tuesday on the investigation told CNN they had not heard of anyone by that name. The Islamic Society of Boston told CNN Wednesday that so far no one in its network reported knowing a ""Misha"" who fit that description. ""We are looking for him,"" said spokeswoman Nichole Mossalam. Uncle called a friend to investigate . Tsarni, Tsarnaev's uncle, told CNN he was so concerned about someone brainwashing his nephew that he called a family friend in the Cambridge area to investigate. ""I said, 'Listen, do you know what is going on with that family? With my brother's family?' Then he says ... there is a person, some new convert into Islam of Armenian descent,"" Tsarni told CNN's Shannon Travis. ""Armenians, I have no intention to say anything about Armenians. It's a neighboring region with North Caucasus,"" the same area where the Tsarnaev family also hails from. ""It started (in) 2009. And it started right there, in Cambridge,"" Tsarni said of the friendship. Aunt reveals clue to older brother's trip to Russia . Tsarnaev's mindset leading up to the bombings at the Boston Marathon may never be fully known. He was killed after a shootout with police last week. His brother, Dzhokhar, remains hospitalized with an array of gunshot wounds. He has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been communicating with investigators in a limited fashion. He has indicated that his older brother, not any international terrorist group, conceived the deadly attack, a U.S. government source said. The preliminary interviews with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suggest the two brothers fit the classification of self-radicalized jihadists, the source said. But the official noted that information from the preliminary interviews needed to be scrutinized. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has also cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's blasts that killed three and wounded hundreds more, a U.S. government official said. Suspect's widow is distraught . The suspects' uncle said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was clearly the leader between the two brothers. ""Dzhokhar is being used by his older brother. (Tamerlan) used him as his -- not even accomplice -- as some kind of instrument,"" Tsarni said. At 26, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was seven years older than Dzhokhar. Friends say Dzhokhar followed his big brother around like a puppy. And as their father is in Russia, the older brother may have become a father figure to the 19-year-old these past few months. At 6-foot-3, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was, by many accounts, an intimidating presence with increasingly strong convictions about society and religion in recent years. Tsarni said he was shocked by the explosions and how his nephews may be involved. ""Tamerlan is off now,"" the uncle said. ""There is no obedience and respect to his own father. That concerns me big time."" CNN's Shannon Travis, Jake Tapper, Brian Todd and Wayne Drash contributed to this report.",1,9.14015863469271
657bdbbeed14d6c0c7312ec942b6f065c7cc3fe2,CNN,"(CNN)When the USS Kauffman steamed out of Norfolk Naval Station earlier this month, it marked the beginning of the end for an entire class of vessels in the U.S. Navy. The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate will be the last of more than four dozen such ships to put itself in harm's way. ""I am honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead such a capable and proud group of sailors on this, the final deployment of an FFG-7 class ship, and to be the last in a great line of frigate commanding officers,"" the Kauffman's skipper, Cmdr. Michael Concannon, said in a Navy statement. The final mission for the Kauffman and its crew of 250 will be to combat drug trafficking in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, the waters of the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. ""What a fitting mission for this great ship and crew to leave as its final legacy, keeping drugs off the streets of America by stopping them at the source,"" Concannon said. After it returns from the drug trafficking mission, the Kauffman will have spent more than 28 years in the U.S. Navy. It will be decommissioned in September and possibly put up for sale to an allied navy. The first of the Perry class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry, was launched in 1976. The Navy once had 51 of the Perry-class ships, which were up to 453 feet long and displaced as much as 4,300 tons. They enjoyed a reputation for toughness, especially after two suffered battle damage in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. Perhaps the most famous of the Perry-class ships was the USS Stark, which survived a deadly attack in the Persian Gulf. Thirty-seven U.S. sailors were killed on May 17, 1987, when an Iraqi jet fired two Exocet missiles into the ship while it was on patrol during the Iran-Iraq war. Less than a year later, another Perry-class frigate, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, was struck by an Iranian mine, wounding 10 of its crew, blowing a 15-foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate's keel, damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom. The crew of the Roberts, however, was able to save the vessel, in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship's superstructure together. The Roberts was then loaded onto another ship, the Mighty Servant 2, in Dubai and transported back to the U.S., ship on ship. Both the Stark and the Roberts were eventually fully repaired and returned to the fleet. The Stark was scrapped in 2006. The Roberts completed what is expected to be its final mission in December, with its decommissioning planned for this year. The Navy defines the primary missions of frigates as protecting shipping and anti-submarine warfare. Those duties will be taken up by the service's new littoral combat ships, 20 of which are either in the fleet, under construction or under contract. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced last week that the LCS will succeed the Perry-class frigates in more than mission. ""Somehow, in the 21st century, we started naming ships with strange acronyms ... instead of from our naval traditions ... so we are going to change the hull designation of the ‪#‎LCS‬‬ class ships to FF (frigate) ... appropriate and traditional name,"" Mabus said in a speech to the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. Those newly designated frigates will join the world's oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy's frigate fleet, the USS Constitution. Nicknamed ""Old Ironsides,"" the Navy's historic tall-masted showpiece was commissioned in 1797 and sails from Boston Harbor to promote the service.",2,8.687595368084175
58e17303db961c1caf6b578ac92ad9d609b35d6f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Police shot and killed eight people who attacked a police station in Xinjiang, a restive region in northwestern China, authorities said Monday. Nine people armed with knives threw explosives at the building and set police cars on fire, the Xinjiang government said on its official news website. One of the people was taken into custody, the statement said, describing the attackers as ""thugs."" The violence took place around 6:30 a.m. in Yarkant County in western Xinjiang and is under investigation, authorities said. It's the latest outbreak of deadly unrest in Xinjiang, a large, resource-rich region that is home to the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. Earlier this month, a clash in the region left 14 Uyghurs and two police officers dead, authorities said. Chinese officials said the two police officers came under attack as they were trying to apprehend suspects. The arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment. The government statement about Monday's clash didn't specify the ethnicity of the people who fought with police. The details of violent encounters in Xinjiang often remain murky. Uyghur diaspora groups, like the World Uyghur Congress, have criticized the Chinese government for the lack of transparency over such events. Chinese authorities have blamed Uyghurs for a vehicle attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. Xinjiang's worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in the capital, Urumqi, between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. That unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces.",1,8.300023700823726
d5f1ca31a20dbb0a4c9c0786f303b79422fef7de,CNN,"Beijing (CNN) -- The Philippines' Foreign Secretary Alberto del Rosario on Friday ended his visit to China aimed at seeking diplomatic ways for the two nations to resolve the South China Sea dispute. During his two-day visit, del Rosario met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi. The two sides ""agreed not to let the maritime disputes affect the broader picture of friendship and cooperation of the two countries,"" according to a joint statement issued at the end of the visit. ""The two sides reaffirmed their commitments to respect and abide by the Declaration of the Conduct of parties of the South China Sea signed by China and the ASEAN member countries in 2002."" The two sides agreed to have more high-level visits. They also plan to boost trade and investments, and to cooperate in science and technology, food safety, infrastructure and transportation. President Benigno Aquino III is expected to visit China in late August or early September, the Philippines' officials say. Del Rosario's trip helps pave the way for the president's visit, according to officials. Tension has grown in the resource-rich South China Sea. In June, the Philippines reported increased activities of Chinese vessels in the waters, saying China undermined the regional peace and stability, and infringed the Philippines' sovereignty. The Philippines renamed the South China Sea to the ""West Philippine Sea"" and removed some Chinese sea markers in disputed waters. China denied the accusation, saying the vessels' activities are ""regular activities of patrolling, scientific research"" and ""survey in the waters under the jurisdiction of China are completely justified and lawful."" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei urged the Philippines to ""stop unilateral actions that impair China's sovereignty as well as maritime rights."" Before his trip to China, del Rosario visited Washington and met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On June 28, the U.S. began an 11-day joint naval exercise with the Philippines in the South China Sea. China says it is not to blame. ""If you want to know why there is tension in South China Sea, I think you have to go and ask the country or countries that have made all the provocations,"" Cui Tiankai, China's vice minister of the Foreign Ministry, told CNN last month.

caf20d0ce08358492b9cb387eca0c25a131168ce,CNN,"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's special police forces declared Sunday that they were in full control of one of the city's biggest and most notorious shantytowns, Rocinha, after a predawn operation aimed at wresting control from drug traffickers. The operation, involving 3,000 police and security forces, had successfully occupied Rocinha and neighboring slums Vidigal and Chacara do Ceu, the Rio de Janeiro government said on its website. ""The next stage will be looking for the criminals that were able to get out of the places we are working,"" military police Col. Alberto Pinheiro Neto told reporters Sunday morning. About 100,000 people live in Rocinha. Some 200 navy commandos with armored personnel carriers and helicopters also participated in the operation. Roads were blocked at 2:30 a.m. and troops started moving in around 4 a.m., according to the local government. CNN affiliate Band News TV showed military assault vehicles rolling in and heavily armed police patrolling the streets. The massive operation is part of Rio's efforts to eliminate crime and arrest drug traffickers in one of the countryÂ¹s most violent cities ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Rio de Janeiro Gov. Sergio Cabral said the so-called ""Shock of Peace"" operation was a ""historic chapter."" ""We are rescuing communities that were abandoned for decades and dominated by parallel powers,"" he told reporters. ""These are people who need to be able to raise their children in peace."" Residents told Band News TV that they were happy that police had stepped up their presence. The operation will have an impact beyond Rocinha, which supplies 80% of the drugs in Rio de Janeiro, Congresswoman Marina Magessi told Band News TV. ""We are certain that from now until the end of the year, there will be a shortage of drugs present in Rio,"" said Magessi, a former police inspector responsible for catching some of Rio's top criminals. Police have already ""pacified"" dozens of favelas since they began operations in 2008, but it's an uphill battle. About one-fifth of RioÂ¹s residents live in the city's 1,000 shantytowns, many of them perched on steep hills overlooking beachside condominiums. Sunday's operation stands in stark contrast to the invasion of the Alemao favela last year when more than 30 people were killed in shootouts. Police arrested Rocinha's top suspected drug trafficker days before they moved in. They found Antonio Francisco Bomfim, known as Nem, in the trunk of a car. On Sunday, police reported capturing a handful of automatic guns and other weapons. They also found the steep and winding roads leading into Rocinha covered with oil, apparently an attempt to make it more difficult for police to enter.

4f3e6e0b35ee478fb2164213d1153d750cb35ef2,CNN,"(CNN) -- If the furnace in your basement stopped working, and you hired a company to repair it, what would you do if several of the workers came upstairs, told you they couldn't figure out how to get the furnace started, and then began pointing fingers at each other and saying: . ""It's his fault."" ""No, it's his fault."" ""If he'd listen to me, we could get this job done."" ""He tries to stop me every time I'm on the verge of fixing your furnace."" You'd probably stand there slack-jawed, hardly believing what you were witnessing. Then you'd say: . ""I don't want to hear you guys blaming each other. I'm paying you to do a job. Just go back down there and do it, or if you can't, get out of my house."" Or if you had a leak in your plumbing, and the plumbers emerged from under your sink to tell you: . ""I'm sorry -- I can't work with this man. He undoes everything I'm trying to do to get your pipes back in shape."" ""So typical of him to put the blame on me. He's got it exactly backward. I know how to stop the leak -- he has no idea. And he never has."" You'd tell them that this is not what you hired them to do. Why are they wasting your time and money telling you that it's the other guy's fault that the water is still dripping onto your floor? You'd ask them to keep their personal animosities to themselves and figure out a way to complete the job they'd agreed to do, or else you're not going to give them a cent. You'd be well within your rights. When work needs to be done, you hire people who promise that they know how to do it, and you expect to get what you paid for. You are the employer; you are the boss. But in one area, this doesn't seem to be the case. In politics and government, almost all Americans agree on the tasks that urgently need to be completed. A few of them: . â€¢ Creating jobs so that finding meaningful employment can stop feeling like pursuing an all-but-unattainable luxury. â€¢ A fair solution to health care, that compassionate people along every station of the right/left continuum can live with and be proud of. â€¢ Fixing the fallout from the big-bank machinations and the mortgage crisis that have cost so many people their homes. Addressing these problems is a task beyond any of us as individuals. So, in the same way we hire workers to repair the furnace or plug the leak under the sink, we hire workers to fix the big national problems. They have lofty titles and work in buildings made of white marble. We hire our presidents, our members of Congress, and, indirectly, our justices of the United States Supreme Court. And maybe it is time to remind ourselves -- and to remind them -- that they are, in fact, hired hands. They are being paid to do a job. They are not being paid to tell their employers -- the citizens -- why they can't get the job done, or why they can't get along with the other hired hands who are supposed to be working beside them. Only in politics and government, when the hired hands come up short, are they allowed to get away with flicking spitballs at each other as the country waits for results -- spitballs in the form of purportedly clever attack lines packaged and issued by advisers, meant to wound the other side, yet doing nothing to further the completion of the jobs at hand. Whether, individually, we are conservatives or liberals or somewhere in the middle, we have a right to expect the people who have been hired to solve the country's problems to do just that, and to spare us the name-calling and blame-shifting. We wouldn't accept that from electricians or auto mechanics; there is no reason to accept it from men and women with federal titles. There is a self-congratulatory phrase that political pros like to throw around: ""Politics ain't beanbag."" But these days, that's what it increasingly can feel like: a childish game played by people so enamored of the game itself that the playing of it pushes aside the real-world consequences. Those real-world consequences matter -- they matter desperately. And the people who should be the demanding employers -- the citizens -- are tossed about in the heavy waves of the political storm, as if they are mere bystanders who have no standing in all of this. There is another phrase, used as the title of a song by the young Bob Dylan in the years before his name became known all over the world. In a different context from the issues we face now, Dylan called his song ""Only a Pawn in Their Game."" It would be hard to blame Americans today if they sometimes identify with that phrase. But they shouldn't have to settle for feeling like pawns. And this is not a game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",5,11.63668894662868
7f0dc5c5cc5485ab5d19f103a0fdb67eb06cd510,CNN,"London (CNN) -- Ever wondered where your cat goes after it leaves the house at night? Curious what your dog gets up to when it is off the leash? One man was and he has now designed a GPS tracking collar to get a glimpse into the private life of his pet. Dave Evans, from Marlborough in the UK, wanted to work out why his cat Yollo was putting on weight, so he designed a ""cat nav"" to track where he went at night. With his new GPS collar, Yollo's secrets have been revealed, including his penchant for chasing chickens in the early hours of the morning. ""He was actually traveling a couple of miles pretty much every night, visiting other houses and we suspect those other houses were feeding him,"" says Evans. Now that the mystery of Yollo's expanding waistline has been solved, Evans has developed the ""G-Paws"" device he says will be available soon for purchase by other curious pet owners. Animal tracking devices have been available for years using various technologies and at a wide range of costs so make sure to compare the various brands before purchasing one. G-Paws is based on existing GPS technology and the data can be plotted directly onto Google Earth. The light weight, waterproof device takes a recording every five seconds and Evans says it is accurate to two or three meters so you can see the precise route of your furry friend. But G-Paws doesn't give live data -- so no real-time stalking -- which Evans says has helped him keep the cost and weight of the unit down. It's not just cats who are going to have their secrets blown -- the G-Paws device can also be fitted to a dog's collar. If you want to catch your lazy dog-walker, this could tell you exactly how many miles your pet is getting exercised each day. And Evans says he's even been approached by pigeon racers and hawk owners to see if the G-Paws might work for their birds. ""Everyone who owns a pet -- whether it's a cat, a dog, a pigeon -- has got a curiosity that when they're not around, what's that animal up to?"" he said.

63012920168168b61467bd251807f5df00faed64,CNN,"(CNN) -- As the violence in Syria appears to be escalating, Britain and France are pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning attacks on protesters and calling for humanitarian access. The resolution makes no mention of the kind of sanctions or military intervention seen in Libya, raising questions about what outcome the international community sees for Syria. Are you in Syria? Share your photos and videos from the scene, but please stay safe. Here CNN correspondent Arwa Damon in Beirut and Richard Roth at the United Nations in New York outline what is happening both in and outside Syria, as efforts to resolve the crisis continue. What are the protesters demanding? Arwa Damon: Initially protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these reforms have, on paper, been implemented by President Bashar al-Assad, but it was far too little and, by the time it came about, too late. The protests started in reaction to the arrest of schoolchildren in the town of Daraa for painting anti-government graffiti and snowballed into what we're seeing now. It appears that the bloodier the violence that is used against the demonstrators, the more galvanized and hardened they have become until they are now calling for the downfall of Assad's regime. The ideal scenario for the protesters would be a Syria free from the claws of the Assad regime, true democratic elections and an end to the secret service apparatus which pervades all levels of life in Syria. Has Assad made any genuine attempts to meet the demands of protesters? Arwa Damon: It would appear not. He did lift the state of emergency, which was a big deal because it has been in place for nearly half a century, and he abolished a court set up to trying people posing a threat to the regime, but at the same time arbitrary detentions have continued, as has the use of force against demonstrators. So although you could argue that he lifted measures in place for decades, nothing has changed. Is it possible that Assad could still ride it out? Are there any hopes for reconciliation? Arwa Damon: A lot of people I'm talking to say Assad's political career will not survive the uprising. But the question is whether he will be replaced in the short or long term. He could still hold on for an incredibly long time. I think there is a slight chance he could stay on, but that could mean widespread and unimaginable bloodshed because he would need to silence every single opposing voice. Also, importantly, there is no united international voice against Syria to impose the kind of pressure applied on Libya. Does the violence in Syria still appear to be escalating? Arwa Damon: It fluctuates. Some days are incredibly bloody while others, less so. The military seems to concentrate on one area at a time. First we saw Banyas and the coastal areas, then Daraa, then we saw the area on the border with Lebanon, then villages near the town of Homs and now we're seeing the focus on the northwest. But in general, there does seem to be an increase in violence. Is it likely the army will launch an all-out assault to crush the uprising? Arwa Damon: It would be difficult, given the troop numbers we believe are available for an operation to take place simultaneously countrywide. But that doesn't rule out other measures, such as the use of fighter jets. There are certainly fears from some in Syria that there will be a repeat of the 1982 Hama massacre by Syria's military -- acting under orders from Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- in which thousands of civilians are believed to have perished. Many activists are already comparing what is happening right now to Hama, but in slow motion rather than a single, devastating strike. The opposition activists say what we are seeing now is more systematic, sustained slaughter. Is there any evidence that senior officers are defecting? Could this be significant? Arwa Damon: There are reports but nothing concrete. There are a few YouTube videos claiming defections and a few people have been turning up in Lebanon, and in Turkey we are hearing, but I'm not seeing the kind of widespread defections it would take for the security apparatus to break down. It would take a major defection to have any effect because there would still be units loyal to Assad's regime. His brother, for example, is the head of the feared Fourth division and Republican Guard. Syria's military hasn't taken a sideline role like in Egypt or Tunisia, which means if the regime falls the security apparatus is likely to crumble as well because the people aren't likely to accept a military accused of massacring civilians to rule the country in the interim. Is social media still playing a part in the uprising? Is it likely to have a decisive role in the final outcome? Arwa Damon: It's huge. It's not the same as we saw in Egypt, which has been labeled a Facebook revolution because of the role of social networking sites. Syria is the YouTube revolution. If activists weren't posting videos to YouTube, we would have almost no window into what appears to be happening in Syria. Will it be decisive? Yes, absolutely. The reason why people have been able to have such a strong debate about crimes against humanity, about abuses, about the atrocities allegedly committed is because we've had these images on hand. Who are Assad's main regional allies? What effect is the Syrian crisis likely to have on them? Arwa Damon: Russia and China are key players, particularly when it comes to exerting influence in the United Nations. Turkey was a friend but now their relationship has cooled. Iran, however, is a huge ally. Lebanon is terrified about the outcome of crisis because anything to do with Syria tends to have a polarizing effect on Lebanon, largely because it acts as a geographical link between Iran and the Hezbollah leadership in Lebanon and the border with Iran's ideological enemy Israel. Why is there no likelihood of U.N. sanctions or military action against Syria? Richard Roth: The Security Council tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion. Due to history, location, politics and power, Syria has more allies than Libya at this time and so is unlikely to face similar U.N.-mandated action. Russia and China usually feel that it is not the Security Council's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of U.N. member countries. That said, they may eventually budge to at least join the Council in expressing concern or condemnation of what is happening in Syria. But it will take more displays of Syrian brutality for Russia and China to go along with sanctions. Syria's key role in the Middle East peace process also makes military attacks extremely unlikely at this point too.",7,10.089568487558182
9b07cb86cfa507f015386166c4b05709561cbbf3,CNN,"(CNN)It's clearly a chilling message. But after a video from terror group Al-Shabaab calling for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, how worried should shoppers be? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told CNN Sunday that there's ""no credible or specific evidence"" suggesting a U.S. mall attack is in the works. But he warned Americans to watch out. ""If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today,"" he said, ""they've got to be particularly careful."" The Minnesota mall is among those mentioned in the video the Somalia-based terror group apparently posted on Saturday. The video talks about Al-Shabaab's September 2013 attack at an upscale mall in Nairobi, Kenya, calling for similar attacks in the three Western countries. More than 60 people were killed in the Kenyan mall siege, which lasted four days. CNN is only naming the malls that have responded publicly to the terror group's video threat. Mall of America said it's aware that the video lists it as a potential target. ""We take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately,"" the Minnesota mall said in a statement. ""We have implemented extra security precautions; some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be."" The FBI and Homeland Security issued a joint written statement saying local law enforcement and first responders have been told the agencies are not ""aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center."" The police department in Bloomington, Minnesota, which regularly patrols the mall, also said there was no credible threat against it, describing the mall as a ""very safe place."" ""Enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored,"" police said in a statement Sunday. Stressing that there is no known credible threat to any mall, Johnson also cautioned, ""I won't know about when the next bad actor is going to strike."" Another U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the situation also told CNN that there is no actual working threat against any mall in the country and added that no one should avoid going to a mall because of the online threat. A top Canadian official condemned the video, saying authorities there are monitoring threats and will take ""the appropriate actions"" to protect public safety. ""Canada will not be intimidated by threats from any terrorist organization,"" Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said. A joint intelligence bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI states there is no indication of an ongoing plot from Al-Shabaab in the United States, according to two law enforcement officials who have seen it. The bulletin, sent to law enforcement around the country, urges vigilance against a lone wolf-type attack that the group's latest video message could inspire. The intelligence assessment, the bulletin says, is that there is no credible specific threat to malls in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI believe the video was an attempt by Al-Shabaab to compete for attention and recruits with other terrorist groups, one official said. Al-Shabaab's strength is compromised, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN, and while the group has the desire to see a mall attack in the United States, it likely doesn't have the capability to do so. ""There will be enhanced security (at malls),"" Johnson said, ""but public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important, and it's the environment we're in, frankly."" A short time later, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tanya Bradsher told CNN that Johnson ""didn't say that they should not go to the mall. He told shoppers to be extra vigilant and that security was increased."" Matt Swenson, a spokesman for Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, said the governor is ""monitoring this situation, and will continue to consult the guidance of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, who are working together to assure the safety of all Minnesotans."" Security concerns didn't stop shoppers from packing the Mall of America on Sunday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. Some shoppers were taking the situation in stride. Others said they were concerned about the threat. ""I'm scared, because I have kids,"" Brittany Segler told WCCO. The West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, which was also listed in the Al-Shabaab video, said it has implemented extra security and is working with federal and local law enforcement agencies. Edmonton police said there was ""no imminent threat"" to the city, Canadian broadcaster CBC reported. ""This was a very general comment ... it wasn't a specific threat,"" Brian Simpson, deputy chief of the Edmonton Police Service, told CBC. ""However, we as a policing agency (are) absolutely paying attention to this."" In the United Kingdom, Metropolitan Police Counter Terror Command said it is aware of the Al-Shabaab video. The FBI has a program to work with various malls around the country to improve security, the law enforcement official also told CNN. After the 2013 Nairobi attack, the bureau worked with some malls last year to test the readiness of SWAT teams by staging fake attacks during hours when malls were closed, the official said. Although Al-Shabaab has also targeted youth in Canada, Finland and the UK for recruitment, its past attacks have been limited to East Africa. But the Somalia-based militants have heavily recruited in Minneapolis, where young men have been slipping away to join the terror group. The city is home to the largest Somali population in the United States. In addition to Kenya and Somalia, Al-Shabaab has also struck in Uganda, where it killed more than 70 people gathered to watch a World Cup soccer match in Kampala five years ago. Kenya and Uganda have sent their forces to neighboring Somalia to battle the extremists. As the attacks get more daring, the international community has rallied to fight the militants. Last year, the U.S. launched an airstrike in Somalia that killed the Al-Shabaab leader. The terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death. Al-Shabaab started off with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond.

cde4798233fb10ddab6e0b2390de69f70cf0a754,CNN,"San Diego, California (CNN)Political attacks have really gone to the dogs. They used to have more style and substance. It was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth, counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst. It used to be that when you wanted to sling mud at someone whose politics you didn't agree with -- chiefly as a way of making them look bad and yourself look good by comparison -- you'd try to dig up dirt, find a skeleton in a closet or challenge the person's integrity. These days, you don't have to work that hard. The whole process is do-it-yourself. You just go to Facebook and see what embarrassing family photos can be linked to the person you intend to slime. The target doesn't even have to be in the photo. Just the fact that they posted it, or thought it was humorous, or in any way condoned the act is good enough. In our narcissistic look-at-me-and-mine culture, social media networks are veritable treasure chests of blunders, blushes and blemishes. Even with our best efforts to use these sites to showcase our best features, there is plenty of embarrassment to go around. Once you find the photos, you do a little cut and paste. Then you can scribble a few sentences about how shocked -- shocked! -- you are that people could behave in such a manner. Be sure to include a line from the head of some nonprofit that raises funds by advancing the idea that, without a group like theirs, our entire society would be in dire straits. If you're attacking someone on the left, you might hunt around on social media for a photo where they're not wearing a flag pin and accuse them of being unpatriotic. If you're trying to smear someone on the right, you can fall back on the old standby and accuse them of being uncaring. How uncaring? Enough to use a dog as a food stool. The offender in question is 6-year-old Trig Palin, who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother Sarah, one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals. This time, what put Trig in the liberal's version of ""timeout"" is a photo on his mom's Facebook page of him standing barefoot on his new pet dog -- a black labrador oddly named Jill Hadassah -- so he could reach the kitchen sink and wash his dish. The liberal organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was not amused. PETA blasted Palin in a statement, calling her ""hard-hearted"" and ""bizarrely callous."" The statement read, ""It's odd that anyone -- let alone a mother -- would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo."" You know who deserves sympathy? The journalists who got that statement and had to whip up a story based on faux outrage. Palin struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like PETA have lost influence and credibility: the double standard they employ, denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support. Where was the organization last year, she asked, when the liberal talk show hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, posted a similar photo of a girl standing on a dog? Back then, PETA was AWOL. She is right about the double standard. And I admire her spunk. In a world of politicians and even former politicians who are so careful about what they say and do that they don't say or do anything, Palin unplugged is a refreshing exception. There is more to the story. According to media reports, the canine is a service dog that was trained to care for Trig, who has Down syndrome. The little guy doesn't just need special care. It seems that he also needs constant protection -- from liberals who hate his mommy. Trig was first targeted by the left in February 2010, when he was just shy of 2 years old. That's when Seth MacFarlane, creator of the Fox animated comedy, ""Family Guy,"" thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs. In the episode, the character Chris is dating a teenage girl with Down syndrome, and when he asks her what her parents do, she says, ""My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" David Tolleson, head of the Atlanta-based National Down Syndrome Congress, called the gag ""hurtful and stereotypical.""  And Palin's daughter Bristol wrote on her mom's Facebook page that the joke was especially cruel given that her brother already faces a life filled with intolerance and prejudice. On the defensive, MacFarlane claimed at the time that he was ""an equal opportunity offender."" Sure. In 2008, the comedian had spoken at an Obama-Biden rally at a university in Ohio, where he took potshots at Republicans and touted the Democratic ticket. As all this unfolded, we learned -- thanks to Trig -- a valuable lesson about how the tolerant left has a much stronger stomach for intolerance if its aimed at one of its enemies. Now the little guy is at it again, teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air. In a perfect world, I'd prefer that children not mistake their household pets for a step ladder. But whatever else can be said about the world that Trig Palin is likely to face in the years to come, this much we know: It won't be perfect.",4,10.28167343002955
6883cc3a6077b5b331322b6657000bdd3b896136,CNN,"(CNN) -- More and more, today's video game business is driven by huge military shooters like Activision's ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" and Electronic Arts' ""Battlefield 3."" Now, Erik Prince, the founder of a controversial, real-world military group, is stepping into the virtual war zone with a new first-person shooter, ""Blackwater."" Designed exclusively for Microsoft's Kinect for Xbox 360, ""Blackwater"" was developed by Zombie Studios and overseen by Prince, a former Navy SEAL. The shooter is set in a fictional North African town overrun by warlords and opposing militia forces. Players enter the fray as team members of Blackwater, the mercenaries-for-hire company that Prince founded in 1997. Featuring licensed real-world weapons, the game can be played with a traditional controller. But it has been crafted to take advantage of Kinect's motion controls. Gamers will be able to aim, crouch, and interact with the on-screen action using only body gestures and moves to take out enemies through a series of action-packed missions. The game has already courted controversy, since Blackwater employees were linked to the deaths of numerous noncombatants and civilians in the Middle East while employed by the U.S. government. Critics have complained about the game because Blackwater employees take on missions for money, while U.S. soldiers, the focal point of games like ""Modern Warfare 3"" and ""Battlefield 3,"" fight for their country. Following inquiries by Congress into Blackwater actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a shootout that led to the deaths of 17 Iraqis, Prince changed the company's name to Xe and, in 2009, resigned as CEO. He sold the company last year. Although the game was created with the aid of former Blackwater employees, the gameplay does not put players in situations where civilians or noncombatants are targets. The same cannot be said about ""Modern Warfare 2,"" which earned more than $1 billion for Activision a couple of years ago. That fictional game featured an intense airport sequence in which players were forced to target innocent civilians as an undercover terrorist or risk having their cover blown and being executed. Prince talked to CNN in an exclusive interview about the first shooter designed for Kinect, why he decided to enter the games business and what gadget he can't live without. CNN: Why did you decide to enter the video game business? Prince: Video games are an exciting medium. The creativity of design, the technology and the interaction represent the best of American innovation. My father was a brilliant inventor and businessman. He taught me to appreciate the opportunities that America offers to innovators. Working with the brilliant creators in this industry was a logical progression for me. CNN: How involved were you in this game? Prince: I set the overall vision and mission areas for this game. My guidelines were to be interactive, tactically correct, fun and expandable, meaning we can add additional missions and accessories to the game going forward. CNN: What did you learn about how video games are made from this experience? Prince: I now realize that the video game industry is very large and sophisticated, larger even than Hollywood in terms of volume. There is every aspect of specialization in the production of these games. Integrating physical motion into on-screen motion is an exciting new frontier for the industry. CNN: How do you think the Blackwater brand will appeal to the gaming demographic? Prince: I believe ""Blackwater"" will have a unique appeal to gamers, particularly on the Kinect platform. The physical, visual and virtual feel of participating in a mission brings a level of excitement and realism to the game that is hard to match. And frankly, it's fun. I think gamers will really enjoy playing the game. CNN: Do you play games or have any background playing games? If so, what have you played lately? Prince: I'm afraid I don't have time to play any games these days. I certainly played a lot when I was a kid and I know it helped develop my hand to eye coordination. CNN: What are your thoughts on how video games have evolved over the years? Prince: The video game industry is constantly evolving. The sheer creativity matched with cutting-edge technologies gives me the comfort that innovation is alive and well in America. And we can see the impact that the gaming industry is having on other entertainment media, as well as military training or flight simulation. It's a fascinating synthesis of ideas, technologies and platforms. CNN: How does this game being a Blackwater experience differentiate it from franchises like ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,"" ""Medal of Honor"" and ""Battlefield""? Prince: ""Blackwater"" on the Kinect system gets you up and moving. You'll have to act and react with something more than your thumbs. It is definitely the next step of progression into a truly interactive experience. CNN: Why do you think simulation military shooters are so popular today? ""Call of Duty"" is the biggest game franchise of all time. Prince: The popularity of simulation military shooters today is really no different from the popularity of playing soldier or cops-and-robbers when we were kids. Take timeless themes of courage, good vs. evil and war, and add today's technology and you get a very popular genre. We've taken the proven concept a step further with this game by having the player actually have to move their body to navigate the game. The military uses video games -- from America's Army online game to the new Dismounted Soldier Training System (which uses the Crytek game engine and virtual reality to train squads in war zones). CNN: What are your thoughts on the role games are playing in training in the military today? Prince: Training for any difficult job is essential. Combat being the most difficult, it's the same reason the Navy started the Top Gun program during Vietnam, because they were losing way too many new pilots during air combat. Top Gun, by giving pilots realistic experiences simulating combat, drastically improved their performance and survivability. With video game simulations, DOD is providing many of the same sights/sounds and system overloading experiences to soldiers before they encounter a real firefight so they are prepared to make good decisions in the middle of all that stress. CNN: Outside of work, what's a favorite piece of technology or gadget that you can't live without and why? Prince: My kids would certainly comment on my use (or overuse) of a BlackBerry and iPad.",3,10.212974368690524
1ae2cb151e514e327c39561d6f6dfca4a7eb4ad0,CNN,"(CNN) -- The scandal embroiling the empire of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International might extend from London to Washington, legal experts not personally involved in the unfolding matter said Monday. The potential liability flows from journalists at individual newspapers, such as the recently defunct News of the World, to its parent, News International, to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. ""The allegation so far with this phone hacking scandal includes a component where someone within News Corp.'s organization perhaps made payments to London police officers to perhaps obtain information that would thus allow News of the World to write newspapers and sell newspapers,"" said Mike Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. If true, that might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which Koehler described as ""a U.S. law that generally prohibits the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official for a business purpose. ""So, there does seem to be a basis for a U.S. investigation at this point."" If anyone at News Corp. participated in payments to police officers or authorized such payments or even knew about them and failed to stop them, the case could wind up in the lap of the U.S. Department of Justice. The potential implications for the Murdoch media empire are numerous and none of them are good, Koehler said. ""Many FCPA enforcement actions have what I call 'a point of entry' -- a set of limited, discrete facts that give rise to the inquiry in the first place. But it's also very common for the 'where else?' question to be asked on the theory that, if News Corp. employees within the organization were making these payments to London police officers, perhaps others in this organization -- all over the world, for that matter -- were making similar payments."" The decision to close the News of the World followed accusations that it illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, and claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said last week that they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. ""There could be potential exposure,"" concurred Don Zarin, author of ""Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"" and a partner with the Washington-based law firm of Holland & Knight. The act stipulates that U.S.-listed companies, their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials. A second portion of the law applies to accounting requirements for public companies. ""They have to keep books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the transactions,"" Zarin said. So, if a bribe was made and not properly noted, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the DOJ could each have a case, he said. A telephone call or an e-mail from an editor in London to his or her boss in New York could prove key, he said. ""If you send an e-mail to the boss saying, 'I'm going to pay $10,000 to police officers for this information,' that would provide the jurisdictional basis or potential liability on the part part of possibly the British employees."" If any employee of News Corp., which is listed in the United States, knew about and authorized such a payment, ""they could have potential exposure,"" he said. And if Rupert Murdoch -- the 80-year-old Australian-born head of News Corp. who became a U.S. citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it -- even implicitly -- ""he could have some potential exposure,"" Zarin said. The penalties can be severe, including jail time and fines, he said. Ignorance confers no protection, he said. ""The SEC has brought cases against U.S. companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing, but had misbooked it,"" he said, adding that the SEC blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior. A DOJ spokeswoman said she could not comment on possible Justice Department involvement. If the charges wind up being nothing more than civil accounting violations, the SEC would handle the case and DOJ would not become involved, said James Tillen, coordinator of the FCPA Practice Group at Miller and Chevalier, a Washington-based law firm specializing in international regulatory issues, tax and litigation. That would still carry a major risk to those involved. ""The SEC has a lot of bite in significant fines, penalties, prohibiting people from serving as officers in public companies,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""That can derail a career quickly."" But a criminal prosecution by DOJ would be the most to fear, since it would carry the potential of jail time, he said. SEC fines can range up to $25 million per violation in such cases, but totals regularly exceed $100 million because the agency can force the company to disgorge ill-gotten gains. The DOJ can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge, he said. Multiple counts could lead to higher fines and sequential prison terms. But fines are typically pegged to how much a company or an individual gained as a result of the crime, he said. That can be easy to figure out when the subject is a contract, but any case involving Murdoch's empire might present more of a challenge. ""How many more newspapers did you sell?"" he asked. Still, U.S. authorities may choose not to intervene at all. ""If the Department of Justice were satisfied that the U.K. had sufficient ability to prosecute this, then they may step aside,"" Tillen said. ""If they weren't satisfied, then they could be very interested."" England passed an aggressive law, the U.K. Bribery Act, which became law on July 1, but it is not retroactive, Tillen said. The predecessor legislation that would apply ""is a hodgepodge"" of laws, some of which date back more than a century, he said. ""That's part of the problem."" Still, as things now stand, the nearly 4,000 miles that separate Washington from London won't put off U.S. investigators. ""Of the 10 largest fines in FCPA history, eight have been against foreign companies,"" Tillen said. But that may change. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, has criticized the act as putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage and held hearings last month intended to water it down, Tillen said. ""The criticism is that it's being overly enforced by SEC and DOJ to reach activities that it shouldn't reach,"" such as taking officials out for free meals, he said. A spokeswoman for Sensenbrenner provided CNN with a statement Monday from the congressman. ""I plan to introduce a bill that would reform the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bring it up-to-date with the changing world,"" Sensenbrenner said in the statement. ""We need to bring clarity to what is and what is not illegal. My intent is to make sure that the stop signs and red lights are clearly visible for American companies doing commerce internationally. ""Right now, there is confusion regarding who qualifies as a foreign official. Foreign law enforcement officers are clearly foreign officials and it is absolutely absurd to imply that any changes to the FCPA would change that status or permit U.S. businesses to bribe policemen,"" he added.",6,12.40143445743435
9fadfaea025c084f246c423ec8ffb7b9bf809aea,CNN,"(CNN) -- Amid calls for greater openness at the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary, the nine justices released their financial disclosure reports Friday. They did so in the old-fashioned way, in person and on paper. The figures reaffirm the members of the nation's highest court, despite earning a government salary, are generally well off financially, and like to travel. The figures show at least six and as many as eight of the nine justices have investments worth at least $1 million. The reports only require they list only a range from investment income. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor listed any financial liabilities, mostly minor credit card debt. But a lucrative rental property she owns, her former New York City residence, brought in between $1 million and $5 million last year, although she still carries a hefty mortgage. Sotomayor also previously earned more than $2 million from her popular 2013 memoir, ""My Beloved World."" But in the latest financial disclosure, the Bronx native reported no ""non-investment income"" last year, indicating royalties from book sales did not exceed her previous advances. Justices Antonin Scalia, $77,000, and Stephen Breyer, about $11,000, separately listed royalty income from earlier books they wrote. And Scalia earned the annual prize for most traveled justice: 28 separate trips for speeches, lectures, and teaching, including visits to New Orleans, Montana, Italy, and Peru. Three out-of-town appearances were before the conservative Federalist Society, which liberal groups have criticized Scalia in the past as an ideological conflict-of-interest. But other members of the court have also participated in events sponsored by ideological non-profits. All nine members of the court reported at least one trip overseas, including to Austria, the Czech Republic, Scandinavia, and Poland. And seven members claimed teaching income from universities, including lectures, which generally earned them about $3,000-$20,000 for one or more days of extracurricular work. Most such stints occur during the court's three-month recess, scheduled this year to begin in late June, when the last of the session's rulings will be issued. Even retired justices have to report their income. Sandra Day O'Connor, who stepped down from the bench in 2006, maintains a remarkable schedule. The 84-year-old said she has 21 positions on various boards and committees, and made 32 separate trips across the country, including promotion for a new book. For their day jobs, the eight associate justices earned a healthy pay raise to $244,400, while Chief Justice John Roberts gets a bit extra at $255,500 per year. It was the first salary increase for members of the federal bench. The Coalition for Court Transparency, an alliance of legal and media groups, has launched a public campaign, urging the court to post its financial reports online, for the convenience of the press and public. The President and members of Congress already do so. ""The media have the right to know about any activities public officials engage in that may influence how they conduct the people's business,"" said Mike Cavender, executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Association and Foundation. ""That our nation's top judges make it purposely harder to obtain this information -- especially given the Internet-- does not conform to 21st century expectations of transparency from public officials."" All federal judges are required to list on annual financial disclosure forms any out-of-town travel for speeches and other appearances that was paid for by private groups.",4,13.937282459658654
a07729fd628cce4d9c2a348376d39a7a11df5f16,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Syrian military began pulling out of the southwestern town of Daraa on Thursday after a mission to ""restore security and calm,"" state TV reported. Government troops have been battling pro-reform protesters over the past month and a half. The human rights group Amnesty International says more than 500 people were killed during the clashes and thousands more were rounded up for questioning. ""Scores were arrested and huge amounts of up-to-date weapons and ammunition in several places were confiscated, which helped bring back the sense of safety to the residents of the city,"" a Syrian military source told the SANA news agency about the Daraa mission. But the international activist group Avaaz said there was little sign of a Syrian withdrawal from Daraa, and warned that remaining Syrian armored units still pose a threat to demonstrators. Syrian soldiers were gathered on the edges of Banias, a city on Syria's northwest coast, according to a witness who spoke to CNN Thursday. ""The army has deployed more than 30 tanks around Banias and 40 armored vehicles,"" said Anas Al Shaghri, a 23-year-old Syrian economics student. ""We are told that the Syrian army will enter the city just like they did in Daraa any minute."" Citizen protesters are posted at checkpoints leading into Banias in an effort to keep the Syrian military out of the city, Al Shaghri said. ""We just carry batons and telephones to film whenever the government thugs and armed security forces attack."" The Syrian military warned the protesters that ""if we don't pull out the checkpoints the security forces will break into the city,"" he said. But Al Shaghri said the protesters ""are not terrorists, nor armed. We are simple a people longing for freedom."" At least 16 people have been arrested and detained in the city over the past three days, he said. The announcement of the pullout from Daraa came a day after Syrian security forces arrested two people outside the University of Damascus as student demonstrators rallied for the release of political detainees, eyewitnesses told CNN. Army convoys and tanks rolled into the capital city, setting up what the witnesses described as a base in the central square. ""The army knows they cannot pressure the economic situation too much in Damascus. Everyone is trying to go about their work, school and their businesses,"" one eyewitness activist told CNN. Amnesty International said it has received firsthand reports of torture and other ill treatment from detainees held in Syria, as a wave of arrests of anti-government protesters intensified over the weekend. The organization said ""widespread, arbitrary arrests"" had taken place in towns across the country in recent days. At least 499 people were detained Sunday during house-to-house raids in Daraa, a key location for pro-reform protests, the group said, adding that most were being held at unknown locations without access to lawyers or their families. The rights group also said it had the names of 54 people killed last Friday, which brought to 542 the number of people killed during a month and a half of protests in Syria. Amnesty International stated in a report that the high number of deaths can be attributed to the tactics used by Syrian security forces. And in a statement released Thursday, Avaaz said more than 400 people -- including members of prominent families who took part in recent protests -- have been rounded up in the Damascus suburb of Zabadani. The group said 38 of those arrested were released Wednesday ""and sent home with instructions to spread the word in their communities of their arrest and torture, as a warning to anyone involved in anti-government activism."" Another 300-plus arrests have been made in Sakba, another Damascus suburb, Avaaz said. CNN could not independently corroborate those reports. Avaaz said more protests are expected across Syria after Friday prayers.",1,8.134376621923495
8a9d47f6750222ed802bb4e798ad06ebacce6214,CNN,"(CNN) -- A man charged in the beheading death of his seatmate on a Greyhound Canada bus last summer is not criminally responsible because he is mentally ill, a judge ruled Thursday, said CNN affiliate CBC News. The ruling means that Vince Weiguang Li will be hospitalized at a psychiatric facility until he undergoes a review by Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board in 90 days, CBC said. ""The goal of criminal law is to punish criminals, not persons who have a severe mental illness,"" Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench Judge John Scurfield wrote in the ruling, CBC reported. However, the ruling angered relatives of Tim McLean Jr., 22, who died on the bus July 30. ""The bottom line is, he is getting away with murder,"" Vana Smart, McLean's sister, told CBC.  Watch how the verdict angers the victim's family » . Prosecutors told reporters Thursday they had no choice but to ask the judge to find Li not criminally responsible. ""This was justice because the correct conclusion was reached,"" prosecutor Joyce Dalmyn said, according to CBC. ""Mr. Li is a schizophrenic. Mr. Li had a severe mental disease. Mr. Li, in my opinion and in the opinion of the psychiatrists, had no idea what he was doing was wrong."" Li, 40, was charged with second-degree murder in McLean's death. A witness on the bus, which was headed from Edmonton, Alberta, to Winnipeg, Manitoba, said a passenger repeatedly stabbed and then decapitated McLean as horrified passengers watched. Just before his death, the victim had been sleeping with his head leaning against the window. ""There was a blood-curdling scream. I was just reading my book and all of a sudden I heard it,"" Garnet Caton, who was sitting in front of the two men, told Canadian TV at the time. She said the knife-wielding man shouted at the other passengers to get off the bus, and they did. ""Me and a trucker that stopped and the Greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that,"" Caton said. ""And when we all got up (to the door), we saw that the guy was cutting off the guy's head."" Thirty-four passengers were on the bus. Police said at the time it was unclear what prompted the attack. Witnesses said Li's weapon was a large butcher knife. Li was arrested after an hours-long standoff, during which he remained in the bus with McLean's body. Police said he was seized after he broke a window and attempted to jump from the bus. ""Mr. Li is also a victim here,"" said Ruth Ann Craig of the Canadian Mental Health Association, according to CBC. ""What's going to happen to Mr. Li is not a cakewalk."" He will be housed in a locked psychiatric ward, Craig said, while he undergoes assessment and treatment to determine whether he is a risk to himself or society. But Tim McLean's mother, Carol deDelley, said she will fight to change the law regarding these types of crimes. ""I'm going to do everything I can to make a change here,"" she said, CBC reported. McLean's father said he is also disappointed with the ruling. ""We've all lost a family member,"" he told CBC. ""This isn't the right result.""",1,6.812076606352708

6f041fd385e0774014ab037a85a0234dfe5d8208,CNN,"(CNN) -- An angry bunch of Americans has taken to the streets to protest government spending and the direction of the nation, and judging by the massive media coverage, it's as if we have been invaded by a foreign entity, marching on state capitals and Washington ready to lead a coup d'état against our elected officials. The rise of the Tea Party is being chronicled as a threat to democracy, or a grassroots collective unlike anything we have seen in many years. As Public Enemy wisely put it with their hit song in 1988, ""Don't Believe the Hype!"" First, let's deal with the Tea Party haters. Please, shut up. How can any liberal, progressive, moderate or conservative be mad about a group of Americans taking to the streets to protest the actions of the country? What they are engaged in is constitutional. The freedom to assemble, march, walk, scream and yell is right there in the document we all abide by. Do I object to idiots holding up clearly racist signs, as well as the stupidity of images of President Obama as Hitler? Of course. That ignorance detracts from whatever commentary they are trying to make on the status of the nation. When I debated Tea Party leader Mark Williams on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 show a few months ago, I was appalled when he was unwilling to say that if someone came to one of his rallies with a racist sign, he would tell them to take it down. He tried to invoke the First Amendment, but he was clearly offering people comfort for such shenanigans. But it's clear that most of the folks attending Tea Party rallies are not bigots and homophobes. There are ignorant fools in all groups, and the Tea Party is no different. If anyone wants to oppose the Tea Party for spreading misinformation, do that. But to assert that it's wrong to take part in civic engagement is utterly silly. The best of this country came out of the action of those in the streets. For those who oppose the Tea Party, you have every right to gather with those who agree with you and take to the streets. If they oppose the policies of President Obama, and you support them, demonstrate your support for his agenda. Don't whine about someone else making noise. Men and women, stand up and be heard. And if you want to oppose the Tea Party, do so on the facts. It's laughable when a Tea Partier laments taxes in the U.S. when, for the middle class, they are virtually at their lowest level in more than 50 years. To suggest that 95 percent of Americans didn't get a tax cut in President Obama's first year is just dead wrong. The reality is that the Tea Party is more aligned with Republicans. According to a CBS News/ New York Times poll released last week, 18 percent of Americans say they view themselves as a member of the Tea Party; 54 percent are Republicans; and 89 percent are white. Sen. John McCain received 59 million votes to Obama's 69 million votes. Those 59 million voters didn't move to Canada or Mexico, so they are predisposed to oppose the president's agenda. So what we really have here is a group of people who are more likely than not to support GOP candidates nationwide. I don't view the Tea Party as being some new entity that is drawing out disenfranchised voters who have long been absent from the process. They are no different in 2010 than what MoveOn.org was in 1998: a group of disgruntled Americans operating outside of the traditional two-party apparatus and expressing their own self-interests. I more than welcome the Tea Party folks. Protesting is America at its finest. But I'm also not fooled one bit by them. They are a rowdy, loud and forceful bunch filled largely with Republicans who oppose the policies of the president. Nothing wrong with that. There were a bunch of rowdy, loud and forceful liberals and progressives taking to the streets to oppose the policies of President George W. Bush. Folks, this isn't a radical transformation of the nation shaping up. It's the latest effort by citizens primarily in one party or professing one ideology to rise up and allow their voices to be heard. And that's a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.",1,11.136467830301314
3245d50ef3559523c475abc2befcd190b3fe81fe,CNN,"(CNN) -- More than 100 people attempting to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico over the weekend threw rocks and bottles at U.S. Border Patrol agents trying to stop them, the agency said Monday. No one was seriously injured. The attempted crossing occurred a short distance from the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California. The group ignored orders to stop from a Border Patrol agent standing watch just north of the border.

ca69acd522fe8cd2796fcd0665e4442a73f6aff0,CNN,"Miami (CNN) -- An eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the Florida Keys last week, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the ""scariest thing"" that's ever happened to her, she said. The woman, Jenny Hausch, was on the chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water. ""These eagle rays, they were flying through the air,"" said Kelly Klein of Two Chicks Charters, the captain of the boat. ""These giant things go out of the water and slam back down."" Hausch said she was in the front of the boat, snapping away. ""The first picture I took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us,"" she said. When the ray jumped again, Hausch said she was readying her camera. ""Next thing I know, it hit me square in the chest. I fell backwards and fell down,"" she said. Klein said the ray kept ""slamming and slamming on top of (Hausch), trying to swim away."" Hausch said the incident happened so fast that she didn't have time to react. ""I was just trying to push it off me as I was scooting backwards,"" she said. Hausch's husband and children watched in horror. Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers Aja Vickers and Bret Swensson were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams. ""We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem,"" said Vickers. As the officers made their way to the boat, Vickers said, ""shoes were getting thrown off the boat, towels were going everywhere."" By the time officers made it to the boat Hausch had freed herself from under the ray. Klein said the animal measured 8-feet across, and probably weighed a good 300 pounds. ""It's just massive, it has a 10-foot tail,"" she added. Klein said everyone thought that Hausch was dead, but when she was freed she didn't have a scratch on her. Hausch said it was the scariest thing that's ever happened to her, and she's thankful she didn't get hurt. Hausch's children were hysterical, but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident wouldn't make them afraid of the water. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds. In 2008, a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys, but Vickers said both incidents were freak accidents. ""This is a total one-in-a-million chance,"" she said. ""These animals aren't attacking by any means. One theory is these animals jump during mating season.""",2,6.963175848576434
3b46e80db81819fdcb8b8044941f64d0fa5abd11,CNN,"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old girl whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case has woken from her coma, a development that could shed new light on what occurred in the basement were she was held captive for decades. Fritzl initially confessed to raping his daughter and having seven children with her. Doctors placed Kerstin Fritzl in an artificial coma in April after she emerged for the first time from the cellar where she was held captive from birth by her father Josef. Kerstin, along with six other children, was born from Josef Fritzl's incestuous relationship with his daughter Elisabeth, now 43, whom he raped repeatedly during the 24 years she was imprisoned beneath his home. Police say Fritzl, 73, has confessed to holding his Elisabeth captive and fathering seven children, six of whom survived. Kerstin was admitted to hospital in Amstetten, west of Vienna, in an unconscious state after Elisabeth persuaded Fritzl that she needed medical attention. Suspicious medics alerted police, who opened an investigation. Detectives began investigating the case after hospital officials started inquiring about the girl's family history. Kerstin and two of her brothers, aged 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight, a television their only contact with the outside world. Another three children Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea that her daughter was being held captive. A seventh child died shortly after birth. Elisabeth and her children have been treated at a secure medical unit since their release. Officials at hospital in Amstetten, Austria, did not release any more information about Kerstin Fritzl's condition. A news conference on the case is scheduled for Wednesday.",8,9.049836449391789

fdea09bccf031c4092c3efb6d9f644423cd0ea74,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On the court they have unparalleled balance, grace and power. Unfortunately, for too many NBA stars, life away from the game can be a far trickier proposition. On target: Desmond Mason was one of the stars on the program. This can be particularly the case when it comes to money, despite the stratospheric salaries on offer, currently averaging more than $5 million a year, higher than in any other U.S. sport. Some players, it seems, are as adept at signing checks as they are shooting hoops. A report earlier this year cited an internal NBA Player's Association (NBPA) study as showing that more than half ex-basketball pros are broke within five years of retirement, many struggling to maintain expensive lifestyles without the regular salary payments to match. But now one business school hopes to help at least some of the current crop of NBA stars become as business savvy as they are athletic. Illinois-based Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management has just hosted its first intake of basketball stars for a four-day executive education program covering topics including business leadership, negotiations, brand building and investing. Jointly developed by the NBPA, the scheme follows a similar program, run for several years by Kellogg and several other schools, which teach business skills to NFL stars (covered previously on Executive Education). While their team mates enjoyed some downtime in the summer off season -- or at least those who weren't winning the men's Olympic basketball gold in Beijing -- players including Quentin Richardson of the New York Knicks, Desmond Mason of the Milwaukee Bucks and Jeff Foster of the Indiana Pacers headed to the classroom for sessions with some of Kellogg's top professors. ""It sounds kind of boring, but it's really not,"" Richardson said afterward. ""There's a lot of interaction and discussion."" ""As pro athletes, we're approached all the time with people saying, 'You can do this or that, just give me the money.' Now maybe we'll be a little better equipped to handle the situation, to know whether the person is serious or not, or whether they have really thought it through to see if it really makes sense."" Mindful of the fact that the average professional basketball career lasts less than five years, the program is intended to both make the most of their earnings while they play and also consider what they might to subsequently. ""We realize that business education is helpful in preparing a person for a career move, especially for professional athletes,"" said Steve Rogers, professor of entrepreneurship at the school, who devised the syllabus, adding that the course does not ""dumb anything down"" for the sports stars. ""The program is optional for these NBA players, so their commitment level is high and they want to learn these business principles."" Rogers now hopes to devise similar programs for other pro sports players in hockey, auto racing and other fields.",4,12.533907353681842
ce5ca1c8e27da631fe11316ee42ad733c1cf97f5,CNN,"(CNN) -- After sushi and ramen, Japanese beef is on the list of must-eats for many visitors to Japan. But other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot, many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from Japanese beef. Considered the caviar of beef in Japan, Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. In recent years, efficient marketing efforts have elevated Wagyu to near-divine status among foodies. But they've also led to confusion about what Wagyu is and what separates Wagyu beef from the even-more heralded Kobe beef. Here's help for beef eaters visiting Japan. What is Wagyu beef? For more than 200 years during the Edo Period (1603-1867), Japan's isolation from the outside world ensured the purity of its livestock, which over time became more and more homogenized. When the country opened to world trade in the subsequent Meiji Era, Wagyu breeding accelerated. Unlike cattle in other countries, which are often bred for a range of traits, Wagyu were and are raised with one goal in mind: supreme flavor. ""Genetics is everything,"" says Jason Morgan, owner of The Meat Guy, a Nagoya-based meat importing business. Wagyu's striking characteristic is its pervasive marbling. Achieving optimum and evenly distributed fat is a slow process. Wagyu are typically bred for upward of 30 months. By contrast, most United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) beef comes from cattle that's about 22 months old. The fattening period is longer than it is on most Western ranches. Wagyu cows eat plentifully and frequently. Japan's lack of vast pastures means Wagyu tend to live a sedentary life, which also contributes to generous marbling. Wagyu grades . Japan has a sophisticated numbering system for tracing each piece of beef produced. The National Livestock Breeding Center (NLBC) maintains records on each cow's ancestry, birthplace, ranch location, fattening days and other details. Restaurants can usually provide a 10-digit tracking number for any steak upon request, which has a code that links directly to the NLBC database. In addition, the Japan Meat Grading Association gives each carcass a score based on its yield (A-C) and level of marbling, firmness, color and overall quality (1-5), with A5 being the highest possible mark. Most Japanese Wagyu beef is in the A4-A5 range. Wagyu yields and pricing . All the care that goes into raising Wagyu cows translates into consumer prices that are typically higher than in many Western countries. Visitors to Japan should expect to pay anywhere from Â¥5,000 ($46) to upward of Â¥15,000 ($138) per person for a meal of authentic Wagyu beef. At the Oak Door Steakhouse at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, meat designated F1 (a mix of two pure breeds, such as Wagyu and Angus) is more popular than pure Wagyu beef because it's cheaper yet still yields good quality. ""Eating Wagyu is considered an investment,"" says Troy Lee, chef de cuisine at Oak Door. ""F1 is the most-consumed beef in Japan. ""For most families, Wagyu beef is a delicacy reserved for special occasions."" Wagyu cows have a high yield of prime cuts. ""In the United States, you can only use three of four cuts for steaks, whereas in Japan you can get high-quality beef from nearly all parts of the cow,"" says Morgan. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity. NLBC figures put the total Wagyu population at around 1.7 million cows as of December 2012, compared with roughly 33 million beef cattle in the United States. How to eat Wagyu beef . Most chefs recommend Wagyu steaks be cooked a little longer than those from Western countries -- medium-rare or even medium. Otherwise, ""they can be like eating a stick of butter,"" says Lee. Steaks aren't the only way to enjoy Wagyu. Traditional preparation methods include sukiyaki and shabu-shabu, one-pot dishes that render out more of the fat than grilling. Sukiyaki simmers thinly sliced beef in a pot with vegetables, usually bathed in a sauce made with soy sauce, sugar and sake. A raw egg is served with the dish, used for dipping the beef after it's extracted from the broth. Shabu-shabu is a light and healthy meal made with strips of meat even thinner than those used for sukiyaki. The beef strips are briefly cooked in a simmering kombu kelp broth. Finally, there's beef tartar or ""nigiri Wagyu sushi,"" though this is a relatively rare preparation in Japan. No matter how it's prepared, virtually all restaurants in Japan have a signature dipping sauce or sauces, which often contain miso, sesame or citrus juice. Wagyu beef myth: Fatty means unhealthy . Health-conscious eaters may be wary of the web of fat (called ""shimofuri"") woven through slabs of Wagyu. However, pure Wagyu contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids (aka ""the good fats"") rich in Omega-3s. One study from the Japan Livestock Industry Association says Wagyu has up to 30% more unsaturated fat than Angus cattle. You may have heard about the fifth ""primary taste"" on top of sweet, sour, salty and bitter: umami, a term and concept that originated in Japan, which describes a subtle sweetness and aroma. The presence of unsaturated fats is what makes Wagyu beef so full of umami goodness. Wagyu cows are rarely, if ever, given antibiotics. One of the primary purposes of administering antibiotics, says Morgan, is to make an animal more feed-efficient. This philosophy runs counter to the goal of Wagyu ranching, which is to raise fat, hungry cattle. Myth 2: Japanese cows drink beer and get massages . While it's true that the Matsusaka Cattle Council's website advocates using beer to stimulate a cow's appetite in humid summer months and massages for uniformity of fat and improved circulation, it cites no actual case studies. At best, these techniques may be used sporadically by small-scale farms. Some ranches may use sake to enhance the luster of an animal's coat and Japanese TV programs have depicted ranches with prongs in cattle pens that animals rub up against to simulate a massage. But we remain skeptical. While it's amusing to entertain notions of Wagyu cows happily guzzling beer while receiving rubdowns, there's no evidence to suggest such practices have ever been commonplace. The Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association states that neither massages nor the feeding of beer or sake to cows is part of its standard rearing methods. ""How's he going to feel a massage through his leather jacket, anyway?"" asks Morgan. Myth 3: Wagyu beef and Kobe beef are the same thing . A common misperception is that all Wagyu beef is Kobe beef. In fact, only .06% of beef consumed in Japan bears the Kobe distinction, and only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade. It wasn't until February 2012 that the first Kobe beef shipment was sent outside Japan -- to Macau. The first (small) export to the United States was in November 2012. Wagyu beef types are named for the region in which the cattle are raised, including, confusingly, Kobe. For the impressive level of marbling in its Wagyu beef, the Kansai region produces the three ""king"" varieties: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty, says Lee of the Oak Door. Kumamoto Wagyu, for example, comes from the rare Japanese brown breed and is a good choice for those seeking a leaner cut. Although many ranching outfits in Australia and the United States are now raising Wagyu crossbreeds, only four facilities in Japan are certified to export Wagyu beef to the United States. So, the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic Wagyu beef remains Japan. Just one more reason to visit.

ecaf95a1371222debee6dcbc1e75a9c8f1c87e8f,CNN,"(CNN) -- A day after North Carolina became the latest state to approve a constitutional amendment defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman, opponents of the referendum are beginning Wednesday to explore their next options. North Carolina voted Tuesday to outlaw same-sex marriage, which was already prohibited in the state. Supporters pushed for the constitutional amendment, arguing that it is needed to ward off future legal challenges. Voters approved the amendment by a 61%-39% margin with all counties reporting, according to unofficial returns from the State Board of Elections. ""It is a very sad day in North Carolina,"" said Tori Taylor, 23, a Charlotte resident who voted against the amendment. ""There were a lot of college students, young professionals who came out to vote. We have gay friends. A lot of us are integrated to that culture. Do you think your friends should have the same rights? It's black and white. Of course, they should."" The North Carolina amendment alters the constitution to say that ""marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized"" in the state. ""It writes discrimination into our state constitution and gives the majority the chance to vote against the minority,"" said Anne Fawcett Krishnan, 33, of Greensboro. But Vote for Marriage NC, which supported the amendment, applauded the passage, saying it solidifies the state ban and ensures the definition of marriage does not change. ""We are not anti-gay; we are pro-marriage,"" said Tami Fitzgerald, chairwoman of the group. ""And the point -- the whole point -- is simply that you don't rewrite the nature of God's design for marriage based on the demands of a group of adults."" Experts expressed concerns that the language of the amendment is so vague, it could strip other unmarried couples of some rights as well. It could affect unmarried couples who live together and bring them unintended consequences on issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence, said Kathryn Bradley, a law professor at Duke University. It also strengthens the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue, Bradley said. Some municipalities in North Carolina provide benefits to same-sex couples, and those rights could be lost with passage of the amendment, she said. Opponents of the amendment regroup Wednesday to decide the next course of action, with some planning campaigns in cities across the state this week. The groups acknowledged the loss but urged supporters to keep fighting. ""We can't change the results of this vote, but we can determine what comes next,"" said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, director of Campaign for Southern Equality. ""When kids across the state wake up, I want them to know that this story isn't over."" Campaign for Southern Equality said it will launch a ""we do campaign to take action"" Wednesday, with events planned across various cities all week. Another group, Equality North Carolina, plans to hold a news conference Wednesday to discuss the amendment. But its backers said they are not deterred. ""Despite the relentless lawsuits and attempts to marginalize supporters of traditional marriage, a clear majority of the American people have not given up on standing in support of marriage,"" said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. ""But instead, the evidence suggests they want to see it strengthened and preserved for future generations."" The state House and Senate voted in 2011 to put the amendment before state voters. Both chambers are Republican-controlled for the first time in 140 years. President Barack Obama said he was ""disappointed"" by the vote, describing it as discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said. Americans overall are closely split on the issue, according to a recent Gallup survey. About 50% of Americans believe same-sex couples should be allowed to wed -- up considerably from polls in past years. An additional 48% say such marriages should not be legal. Before Tuesday, 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union. ""Of states without constitutional amendments on marriage, 45% (nine of 20) eventually recognize same-sex marriage, either by direct judicial decree, by legislative action, or by a ruling requiring that same-sex marriages from other states be treated as valid,"" the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriages, said in a statement. ""Among the 30 states with marriage amendments, none have been repealed."" Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina. Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage.

78f3eb572923571b5db76c6f8ab8ba6e12e64c7c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The oldest sitting member of Congress was airlifted Saturday following a car accident in his native Texas, though the 91-year-old apparently took the flight in stride -- ""joking with paramedics"" on his way to Plano, according to his office. Rep. Ralph Hall was being driven by his friend, 73-year-old Howard Zielke, when someone turned into them and collided with their vehicle around 2:50 p.m. (3:50 p.m. ET) in Fannin County, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported. The other car's driver didn't need to go to a hospital, while Zielke was transported to a hospital in McKinney, the state agency said. Hall, though, was flown to The Medical Center of Plano with what the public safety department described as ""serious injuries."" Joy Dover, a hospital spokeswoman, said later Saturday that Hall was in stable condition. The congressman's office provided more details. It described Zielke as one of Hall's ""close friends"" and said he was ""not hurt."" As to Hall himself, his office said he ""suffered a hip injury and minor cuts and bruises, but is expected to make a full recovery."" The same statement noted that the congressman -- who'd arrived home from Washington on Friday -- was ""joking"" with health staff on his medical flight. The idea that Hall might find humor in an otherwise bad situation, perhaps, shouldn't be too surprising. Shortly after losing a Republican primary this spring to tea party-backed candidate John Ratcliffe, thus spelling an end to his 32-year stay in Congress, Hall cracked: ""I figured it out -- damn guy got more votes than I did!"" He pointed out, too, that he couldn't get unemployment yet since he has ""a job here until December 31st."" ""At 91-years-old a contract for six months -- you can't beat it,"" he said then, referring to the rest of his term in the House.",8,11.152511981927354

aa1914ff1697d25b96d468f07312ff8d36839844,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Sen. Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by a sermon at his church this week that mocked Sen. Hillary Clinton. A video making the rounds on YouTube shows the Rev. Michael Pfleger mocking Clinton for becoming teary-eyed before the New Hampshire primary in January. In the video, Pfleger wipes his eyes with a handkerchief and suggests Clinton wept because she thought that as a white person and the wife of a former president, she was entitled to the presidency. ""And then, out of nowhere, came 'Hey, I'm Barack Obama,' "" Pfleger said during a sermon Sunday at  Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois. ""And [Clinton] said, 'Oh damn, where did you come from?  I'm white!  I'm entitled!  There's a black man stealing my show!' ""   Watch Pfleger mock Clinton » . The video shows the congregation laughing and cheering. Pfleger is a Catholic priest at St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church on Chicago's southwest side. He is also a friend of Trinity's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, from whom Obama distanced himself in April. At the time, Obama said he was ""outraged"" by Wright's remarks suggesting the U.S. government might be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equating some American wartime efforts with terrorism. Obama has known Pfleger for more than 20 years. His campaign condemned Pfleger's comments. ""As I have traveled this country, I've been impressed not by what divides us, but by all that that unites us,"" Obama said in a statement Thursday. ""That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger's divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause."" The Clinton camp also condemned Pfleger's remarks. ""Divisive and hateful language like that is totally counterproductive in our efforts to bring our party together and have no place at the pulpit or in our politics,"" the Clinton campaign said. ""We are disappointed that Sen. Obama didn't specifically reject Father's Pfleger's despicable comments about Sen. Clinton and assume he will."" Pfleger apologized for his comments Thursday evening. ""I regret the words I chose on Sunday,"" he said in a statement. ""These words are inconsistent with Sen. Obama's life and message, and I am deeply sorry if they offended Sen.

65eb9058c4fce39460cabe2eb249c551f2abc63d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, ""decision points,"" I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good. Hurricane Katrina's devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory. Bush's ""heckuva job"" remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing. That was what it was. But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush's determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people's futures. I know what I'm talking about. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana's governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state's commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I've kept a close watch over the last eight years. Hurricane Katrina wasn't one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: ""Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,"" he said. He is so right: Katrina's waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives. Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas. How will history remember George W. Bush? My older sister, Sheila -- people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike -- was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious. CNN's Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building's rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn't leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge. My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset -- mad as hell -- and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out -- act against Bush -- but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""how can I help you?"" ""Civility,"" he said. Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush . Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley's ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party. So far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people -- Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston -- have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway. Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation: ""Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives."" Glimpse at a White House before everything changed . George W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf's residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked. Bush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn't forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students. Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts. It was a team effort. I'm glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010. I'm also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans.

24e5505d5addc6500588d85aa01fbe091ef86e99,CNN,"Madrid (CNN) -- An unprecedented court hearing for Spain's Princess Cristina in a financial corruption scandal, scheduled for April 27, was postponed Friday after a prosecutor filed an appeal, judicial officials said. No new date for the hearing was immediately set, because a three-judge panel must first resolve the conflict between the view of the judge who issued the subpoena that there is sufficient evidence to cite the princess as a suspect, and the prosecutor's view that there is not, the officials said. Princess Cristina is King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter. This is the first time since democracy was restored in Spain in 1975 that a member of King Juan Carlos' immediate family has faced preliminary charges of any kind, in any case, a spokesman for the Royal Household said. On Wednesday, the investigating magistrate, Judge Jose Castro, issued the 18-page order that brought preliminary charges against Princess Cristina in a fraud case centered on her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, the king's son-in-law. Urdangarin has faced preliminary charges for more than a year. He is accused of diverting, for private use, public funds earmarked for his non-profit foundation. He denies any wrongdoing. The scandal already had created unprecedented problems for the popular royal family due to Urdangarin's alleged involvement, but after the princess was also named as a suspect, it became top news at home and abroad. On Friday, prosecutor Pedro Horrach filed his appeal to Castro's local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. A higher provincial court in Palma must decide if the princess will remain a suspect in the case. If she does, the princess has chosen two top lawyers, the Royal Household announced on Friday. One is Miquel Roca, a Barcelona-based former politician who helped write Spain's Constitution of 1978. The other is well-known criminal lawyer Jesus Maria Silva. The Royal Household initially said on Wednesday it wouldn't comment on judicial matters, but later in the day announced that it was surprised that the judge -- who last year said in an order that there was insufficient evidence to name the princess as a suspect -- had changed his mind. In his order, the judge said that further investigation since last year had led to the decision to bring preliminary charges against the princess. Castro's order said Princess Cristina should be questioned regarding ""the handling and destination of funds obtained"" through her husband's foundation and a separate company . The Royal Household also said on Wednesday that it was in ""absolute conformity"" with the prosecutor's announcement that he would appeal. The main opposition Socialist Party has called on the Royal Household to remain neutral in the legal battle between the judge and prosecutor over the evidence regarding the princess. On Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters that the case is hurting the image of Spain. On Friday, the Royal Household made public for the first time that it had quietly asked the government, two months ago, to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities -- that is currently being debated and pending approval, a Royal Household senior spokesman said . Urdangarin was given the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina in 1997. An adviser to the Royal Household also has been implicated in the scandal. Earlier this year, a judge ordered Urdangarin and a former business associate, Diego Torrres, to deposit a joint bond of â‚¬8 million (about $10.8 million) for potential civil damages. If not, the judge would move to embargo the assets of the two men, a court spokeswoman said. No trial has been set in the case. The preliminary charges that have been announced could eventually be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion.",1,10.462270056470633

It was the first time anyone other than world No.1 Serena Williams had beaten the Russian on the red stuff since the 2011 French Open. Sharapova had been tuning up for this year's grand slam at Roland Garros in fine fettle, winning tournaments in Stuttgart and Madrid, but Ivanovic stormed to 6-1 6-4 victory to end her run in the third round of the Rome event. ""My energy level today maybe was not the best,"" Sharapova told reporters in Rome.

76945e234145ec4ee0c6485c4796e329f0b271f4,CNN,"(CNN) -- The whistleblower website WikiLeaks said Sunday that it was under cyber attack, preventing it from posting tens of thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables, it said via Twitter Sunday. Despite the glitch, five international news outlets which had obtained the documents ahead of time published details of the leaked documents on their websites. The announcement of the apparent attack came shortly after the United States warned WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange that publishing the papers would be illegal and would endanger peoples' lives. The New York Times, The Guardian newspaper in England, and newspapers and magazines in three other European nations published portions of the new classified material on Sunday. The site, meanwhile, was experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack, it said. That's an effort to make a website unavailable to users, normally by flooding it with requests for data. As of 3 p.m. Sunday, the site was inaccessible. The U.S. State Department's legal adviser said Saturday that if any materials in the posting of documents by the site were provided by government officials without proper authorization, ""they were provided in violation of U.S. law and without regard for the grave consequences of this action."" WikiLeaks indicated last week that it was preparing to release a new batch of previously classified U.S. military documents. ""Next release is 7x the size of the Iraq War Logs,"" the group stated via Twitter Monday. ""Intense pressure over it for months. Keep us strong."" State Department Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh told Assange he was responding to a letter about the newest leak. Koh wrote that the department had spoken with representatives from The New York Times and The Guardian newspapers, and the German magazine Der Spiegel about 250,000 documents the whistleblower organization provided to them for publication. WikiLeaks said Sunday it had also given documents to El Pais in Spain and Le Monde in France. Koh described the distribution as the ""illegal dissemination of classified documents"" and said it would ""place at risk the lives of countless individuals"" -- criticisms that have been repeated by U.S. officials after past postings on the site. The information blitz from WikiLeaks is expected to offer a glimpse into the worldwide communications of the State Department and its 297 embassies, consulates and missions through what are commonly referred to as ""cables."" Koh wrote that releasing such documents could jeopardize relationships with allies, military actions and anti-terrorism operations.

Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter. Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world. The Dreamliner is Boeing's next-generation passenger jet. It is touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials. Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November.

fbe73bc6da464c327be5a1bddb2515fc5e0b1d69,CNN,"(CNN) -- The power of music and the power of politics met Tuesday, with a hip-hop mogul and one of the most prominent leaders in Congress joining their considerable forces to spotlight issues facing youth in America. Russell Simmons hopes by investing in youths they can stay out of trouble and be more successful adults. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attended a youth conference co-sponsored by entrepreneur and entertainer Russell Simmons in Washington. The one-day event, called Keeping the Promise to Our Children, brought legislators together with entertainment A-listers, including Oscar-nominee Terrence Howard, who used their celebrity to advocate a variety of causes: foster care, health care and education among them. Simmons' Hip Hop Summit Action Network and the nonprofit, California-based Children Uniting Nations hosted the event. This is the fourth conference organized by Daphna Ziman, an adoptive mother of a child formerly in foster care and founder of Children Uniting Nations, which matches children in foster care with mentors. Actress Gabrielle Union and actor/musician Howard were among the celebrities at the conference who pushed for policy changes directed at improving educational outreach to foster children. Only 54 percent of children in foster care graduate high school, according to the University of Chicago's Chapin Hall Center for Children. ""Intervening in the lives of these young people, giving them a sense of dignity and worth, providing them with more opportunities, therefore, is one of the most important things you can do, not just for them, which is the most important thing, but for the strength of our country,"" said Pelosi at a news conference before the event. Panel discussions at the conference also addressed nutrition, mental health, HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. Children Uniting Nations plans to lobby Congress on these issues, said the organization's spokeswoman, Juliette Harris. Last year, the organization pushed for a $5,000 college loan subsidy for students who mentor at-risk youths, and the subsidy was passed in the House as part of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This year, the organization has lobbied for the Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2009, which was introduced by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana; and Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-New York, also attendees at Tuesday's conference. The act proposes an allocation of $15 million for foster-care mentoring programs. Investing in youths now can help them stay out of trouble and be more successful adults, said Simmons.

a3b51d25aec35efbf72fa72acccc7e110c4cd539,CNN,"Ridgeland, South Carolina (CNN) -- After months in an immigration detention facility, Hector Adame was so surprised when guards said he could go that he didn't believe them. ""They had to shout (the news) at him so he would leave,"" his wife, Victorina, said this week. The family soon learned that Adame -- who had first been arrested on a drunk driving charge -- was one of more than 2,000 immigration detainees federal authorities released last month in a controversial move that officials said would cut costs as forced budget cuts loomed. But the construction worker's joy at being released was short-lived. Now, the undocumented immigrant is back behind bars. So are more than two dozen others, according to federal officials. ""The 28 individuals were brought back into ICE custody after either violating the terms of their supervision or after the agency discovered information not available during an initial review of their case,"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said in a written statement. ""ICE will continue to review the terms of the release for the individuals as part of its routine practice and will reconsider conditions as necessary."" Adame was detained again after an arrest for driving without a license, his wife says, adding that she thinks authorities targeted him because they wanted to send him back to the detention facility. ""They were waiting for him,"" Victorina Adame says. Debate over the decision to release detainees resurged this week at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, where some lawmakers accused the country's top immigration official of releasing detainees for political reasons. ""This release is a recipe for disaster that is irresponsible and unjustified,"" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who chairs the committee. ""Ultimately, these nonsensical actions demonstrate the inability and lack of desire on behalf of the administration to enforce the law even against illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes."" ICE officials have said the move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take the $85 billion in forced government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration, into account. And they stressed that detainees released were non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories. This week, ICE Director John Morton maintained that the measure was necessary to cut costs. ""The agency is asked to do far more than Congress could appropriate or could rationally appropriate to the agency. We are in a situation where there are 11 million people on average who are here unlawfully. The agency has resources to remove about 400,000 a year, which is less than 4% and it is why at the end of the day, I think, bipartisan efforts to come to some level of comprehensive immigration reform is the thoughtful way out,"" he said this week. ""The agency is never going to be able to detain and remove everybody as a matter of budget nor does it make sense as a matter of policy."" Morton said the detainees that were released were not dangerous, and that he had to find some way to make ends meet. ""I did not want to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" he said. ""My view is that we need to maintain the operations of the agency."" Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, criticized that explanation. ""Now, I've counted six times you have said you didn't want to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" Gowdy said. ""I don't want Peter or Paul to rob one of our fellow citizens because you guessed wrong on who to release."" Meanwhile, Victorina Adame says she and her five children are left looking at pictures of her husband in their South Carolina home, wondering when they'll see him again and whether he'll be deported to Mexico.

bdb478d462f066ef4caed202757303f4232be3ed,CNN,"(CNN) -- The legacy of the Hatfields vs. the McCoys looms large in Mingo County, West Virginia. Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and ""punishment"" that in one case allegedly amounted to denying the accused an ice-cream break. The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013. The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her ""breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks."" Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday. She would not divulge what those charges were. Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges. Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an ""extreme"" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied. As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said ""the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest."" That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement. Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption. In the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case. Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that ""a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders."" That investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was ""ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims."" When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official ""'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,"" the attorney general's court filing said. The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators ""threatened (the girls) with discipline"" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims were retaliated against when they did. The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the ""bullying"" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school. The next day she was written up again, this time for ""insubordination,"" according to the filing. The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official ""retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level."" When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal ""went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.'"" CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said ""the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County."" CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.",1,7.706874088280585

Portuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said. And don't think you can close the door and keep them out. ""They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,"" she said. Teasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are ""not apartment dogs,"" she said. Harding agreed. ""They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,"" she joked, ""we recommend a stuffed dog."" Portuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers. Harding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because ""they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work."" For other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, ""Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed."" Teasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the ""Dalmatian syndrome."" After the movie ""101 Dalmatians"" came out in 1996, ""thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,"" Teasley said. What those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said. Both Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog » . ""For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,"" Harding said. She has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said ""produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles"" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America. Such organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit. ""It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),"" Teasley said, ""But I'm not. We just don't want dogs to come back because owners don't know what they are doing.""",2,7.062846961829162
dce18eab34a6b07668fea7b57fbdb9588f724d6f,CNN,"AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- A 12-year-old Yemeni girl, who was forced into marriage, died during a painful childbirth that also killed her baby, a children's rights group said Monday. Fawziya Ammodi struggled for three days in labor, before dying of severe bleeding at a hospital on Friday, said the Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children. ""Although the cause of her death was lack of medical care, the real case was the lack of education in Yemen and the fact that child marriages keep happening,"" said Seyaj President Ahmed al-Qureshi. Born into an impoverished family in Hodeidah, Fawziya was forced to drop out of school and married off to a 24-year-old man last year, al-Qureshi said. Child brides are commonplace in Yemen, especially in the Red Sea Coast where tribal customs hold sway. Hodeidah is the fourth largest city in Yemen and an important port. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 -- many times to older men, some with more than one wife, a study by Sanaa University found. While it was not immediately known why Fawziya's parents married her off, the reasons vary. Sometimes, financially-strapped parents offer up their daughters for hefty dowries. Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. And often, parents will extract a promise from the husband to wait until the girl is older to consummate the marriage. Children's organization UNICEF issued a statement Monday saying: ""Child marriages violate the rights of children in the most deplorable way. The younger the girl is when she becomes pregnant, the greater the health risks for her and her baby. ""Girls who give birth before the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Child marriage denies girls of their childhood, deprives them of an education and robs them of their innocence."" ""More must be done to address the underlying causes in order to prevent tragic deaths like those of 12-year-old Fawziya and her baby,"" the statement added. The issue of Yemeni child brides came to the forefront in 2008 with 10-year-old Nujood Ali. She was pulled out of school and married to a man who beat and raped her within weeks of the ceremony. To escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge. After a well-publicized trial, she was granted a divorce. The Yemeni parliament tried in February to pass a law, setting the minimum marriage age at 17. But the measure has not reached the president because many parliamentarians argued it violates sharia, or Islamic law, which does not stipulate a minimum age.",7,8.40971749323003

76504406f58d888916f8bd6443496f1b2ef0e6c5,CNN,"(CNN) -- A legal fight is under way in Pennsylvania that could decide if the socially conservative state legalizes same-sex marriage. A county clerk in suburban Philadelphia has given nearly 100 same-sex couples marriage licenses, even though the state bans same-sex marriage. D. Bruce Hanes, the elected register of wills in Montgomery County, has been doing this for about a month, and the state Department of Health is now taking him to court to try to make him stop. The case could lead to a reversal of the state's version of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, if a judge were to side with Hanes in finding that the ban on same-sex marriage contradicts the state's constitution. In June, in the case U.S. v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key part of DOMA, which defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. Hanes told CNN that about four weeks ago, he was approached by a lesbian couple wanting a marriage license. Instead of immediately saying ""no,"" Hanes and his solicitor reviewed the state's constitution and decided that language about civil rights, happiness and liberty applied to same-sex couples who want to get married. ""We've either got to change the constitution -- permit discrimination on the basis of sex, permit civil rights to be frustrated -- or change the interpretation of that marriage act or change the marriage act. You can't have it both ways,"" he said. Hanes has received dozens of thank-you cards, and his office benches are filling up with same-sex couples driving from across the state to get marriage licenses. But not everyone is on board. The state filed a petition to make him stop, citing a law passed by the state legislature in 1996 that defines marriage as ""between one man and one woman."" At least one lawmaker says Hanes has gone rogue. ""He's a lowly elected official in a county office who is not elected to set policy, but to administer the law as it's been passed,"" state lawmaker Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican, said Friday. ""For a man to start violating the law as he has and commit such a lawless act should be offensive to everyone, no matter what side of the issue you're on."" Metcalfe says he believes the marriage licenses are invalid. ""It doesn't matter how many licenses he issues, they're not worth the paper he's printing them on,"" he said. He also said he's drafting legislation to have the state's attorney general, Kathleen Kane, impeached because she said she believed she couldn't defend the state's version of DOMA. His legislation will be introduced when the state legislature returns in September. Metcalfe is also calling for Hanes to be impeached and says he's gotten a lot of support. The petition filed by the Department of Health states that Hanes is in ""direct defiance"" of that law and that he ""risks causing serious and limitless harm to the public."" Kane is not commenting on the case, since her office isn't handling the petition. But earlier this year, she said she came to the same conclusion as Hanes: The state's version of DOMA conflicted with the state constitution. ""DOMA is wholly unconstitutional. It cannot be fixed,"" she said in early July when the American Civil Liberties Union sued Pennsylvania after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Windsor case. Danny Cevallos, a prominent Pennsylvania civil and criminal attorney, says this is exactly the kind of case that could end up deciding the fate of same-sex marriage in the state. Laws, he said, are made this way all the time. ""The issue is going to be whether or not a reading of the constitution can be read to override the state law ban on marriages,"" Cevallos said. ""The state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania could review this and strike down the state ban."" In the meantime, it's unclear whether same-sex couples with marriage licenses in the state would qualify for benefits. But for now, Cevallos says, Pennsylvania has become the 14th state to have legal same-sex marriages. Hanes says he doesn't see himself as a crusader -- just an elected official doing his job. ""In the ordinary course of business, two people are coming into my office, sitting on a bench, waiting to get a marriage license, and they're getting those marriage licenses regardless of their gender,"" he said. ""This is the way it ought to be, and that's the way I would like it to be."" One thank-you note that arrived at his office reads, ""If possible I would like to have your autograph."" ""That's interesting,"" Hanes said. ""I haven't done that.""",1,12.120894824311941
cd7ee2c93cc86dce57ba635d8515831c1138ebb9,CNN,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britons including Prime Minister Gordon Brown have leapt to the defense of their creaking healthcare service after President Barack Obama's plans for a similar system in the United States were branded ""evil"" by Republicans. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter. Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents, while leading politicians have spoken out in support. Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an ""evil"" move that would result in ""death panels"" deciding who would live or die. Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain's NHS. In an article, Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by ""Orwellian"" bureaucrats who put a price tag on life. Sound off: What do you think of the British healthcare model? The comments caused a storm of protest in the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Brown wading into the argument via micro-blogging site Twitter, where a conversation chain, ""#welovetheNHS"", is generating huge online traffic.  Britons react to the U.S. healthcare debate » . A posting on the 10 Downing Street Twitter site on Wednesday read: ""PM: NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort, despair and hope, life and death. Thanks for always being there."" The message was followed by another, from Brown's wife Sarah, adding: ""#welovetheNHS -- more than words can say."" Professor Stephen Hawking, author of ""A Brief History of Time"", also spoke out in favor of the British system, telling the Guardian newspaper that he owes his life to NHS treatment for the neuro-muscular dystrophy he has suffered from for 40 years. ""I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS,"" he said. ""I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."" Despite the support, the 51-year-old NHS is regularly the target of criticism at home, with opposition politicians accusing Brown's government of mismanagement resulting in long waiting lists and a ""lottery"" in deciding who gets life-saving drugs and surgery. Nevertheless, opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron also added his voice to the defense campaign with a posting on his party's Web site. "" Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family. ""One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you."" His statement followed comments from one of his own party members backing the Republican criticism of the NHS. Dan Hannan, a Conservative member of the European Parliament reportedly said in an interview that ""he wouldn't wish it on anyone.""",8,7.422260073304293
0239342f05436085947bd0c5173a4636ee772b51,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that ""people need to serve where they are needed."" Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of ""directed assignments"" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week.  Watch the diplomats exchange angry words » . ""I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,"" said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. ""Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK,"" Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats."" However, she said, ""This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations."" Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, ""I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed."" The secretary sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. ""This year [U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq,"" Rice said in the cable. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of  officers to serve, ""should it prove necessary to direct assignments."" ""Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,"" she said. Rice earlier said reports that the State Department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Iraq ""couldn't be further from the truth."" The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said. McCormack rejected comments by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that State Department employees are ""nervous Nellies"" and that wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq, he said. But with the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. ""They are serving in dangerous and challenging places,"" he said. ""We have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in Anbar and Basra and Baghdad and Kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines."" State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Zain Verjee and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.",3,5.3939015685974745
670344387859873af9e86d09f4da693b9c18e558,CNN,"(CNN) -- The World Cup has provided a festival of football and color in Brazil, and its intoxicating nature has had an effect far away from the shores of the Copacabana. The action and fervor sparked by one of the biggest sporting events in the world has prompted Northern Ireland's two-time major champion Rory McIlroy to turn his mind to another -- the Olympics. And as he stepped up his preparations ahead of the Irish Open in Cork, he decided to announce he'll be representing Ireland at the Rio Olympics of 2016. McIlroy had previously stated his intention to compete under the Great Britain and Northern Ireland banner when golf returns to the Games after 112 years. But confirming his change of heart at a press conference ahead of the Irish Open this week, he said Brazil's hosting of the World Cup had provoked his declaration. ""I've been thinking about it a lot,"" he told reporters at the Fota Island Resort. ""I feel like it's the right decision for me. There's no point in delaying it and letting it linger any longer. ""I don't know whether it's been because the World Cup has been in Brazil and I've been thinking a couple of years down the line. ""I have also thought about all the times that I played as an amateur for Ireland and as a boy and everything so for me it's the right decision to play for Ireland, so I'm going to play for Ireland in 2016. ""If you look at the (Irish) rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players ... they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf. ""So I don't think there's any point to change that or any point to go against that just because it's a different event or it's the Olympics. ""I was always very proud to put on the Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very proud to do it again."" McIlroy, from Holywood in County Down, played amateur golf on an all-island basis before he turned professional and is eligible to represent Great Britain and Northern Ireland as well as the Republic of Ireland. The U.S. Open and U.S. PGA Championship winner received funding from the Golfing Union of Ireland before turning professional in 2007. And he has represented Ireland twice in golf's World Cup event, both times playing alongside compatriot Graeme McDowell -- the 2010 U.S. Open champion. When asked if an Olympic gold medal would rank as highly as a major championship he replied: ""Winning an Olympic medal is still is not as big as a major championship but it's up there. ""The majors in our sport are the biggest and best prizes in the game. But as hopefully golf grows in the Olympics and becomes say bigger in four or five Games down the line then it might become bigger."" Aside from the 2016 Olympics, McIlroy's more immediate concern was getting his clubs back after they were lost in transit by United during his flight to Ireland. The world No. 6 tweeted on Tuesday: ""Hey @united landed in Dublin yesterday morning from Newark and still no golf clubs... Sort of need them this week... Can someone help!?"" His plea sparked the airline into action and it promised McIlroy's clubs would be delivered to the tournament venue on Wednesday. They were as good as their word and McIlroy posted a photo on Twitter saying: ""Re-@united with my clubs!"" McIlroy is in good form after his recent victory at the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth -- and a top 25 finish at the U.S. Open last weekend. He has been paired with three-time major champion Padraig Harrington, from Ireland, for his first two rounds in Cork.",7,7.089367056358862
55d50a32310ea12f5389f74ef8e736c7b7e8a03a,CNN,"(CNN) -- Former England cricket captain Michael Atherton has called him ""ruthless,"" but for Lalit Modi, the man behind cricket's revolutionary Indian Premier League and vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), this is less of a criticism and more a statement of fact. Bringing glitz to the game, Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian revolution. ""I am ruthless, without doubt,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia in Mumbai. ""Otherwise we wouldn't get where we were."" Many believe that Modi, 44, has taken cricket into a new era, turning a sport that can be baffling to watch and take five days to play, into a brightly-colored instant hit of action taking just a few hours. With cheerleaders, the best players in the world and even Bollywood stars as part owners of some of the teams, Modi has concocted a recipe fit for prime-time TV consumption, in a country renown for its passion for the game. Modi's came up with the idea of a new Indian cricket league came 14 years ago, but resisted the involvement of the BBCI at that time, citing too many vested interested within India's main cricketing body that would have spoiled his ideas. While ruthless he is also astute to the financial potential of cricket in India and the IPL. After graduating from Duke University in the U.S. in sports management he returned to India to launch ESPN and 10 Sports. Coming from a family that controls Modi Enterprise, an industrial conglomerate worth $1.5 billion, Modi admits his family were concerned that he was moving away from business and spending so much time with cricket while setting up the IPL. ""They didn't think that I'll be spending so much time with cricket, and cricket has taken up so much time of my time, but the job has made it so demanding. Either I do it well, and if I do it well then I need to give the time for it,"" he told CNN. It's been time well spent, both professionally and personally: Modi has his own private jet, gets mobbed in the streets by fans and can hang out with Bollywood stars. Yet he hasn't made a fortune from the IPL: ""I have an honorary position and BCCI is a charity and a trust. It's a nonprofit-making organization and we do this for development of the game and I'm passionate about the game."" However as vice-president of the BCCI he has been instrumental in boosting its revenues, brokering television deals and sponsorship associations that could see it top the $1 billion mark in the next five years. It's no surprise that such an iconoclastic figure in a game rooted in tradition has his personal critics and those that are skeptical about the direction he is taking the game. Modi was not without controversy himself, as he was accused of drug dealing and abduction while at university, claims that were never proven. The 20-over version of the game played in the IPL has worried some that the finer points of the game may be sacrificed for the instant, mass-market appeal. But for Modi, it's quite simple: ""We've hit records in viewership, record numbers in sponsorships sales, record number in team franchise sales, the owner themselves have done so well, the stadiums are full. We got Bollywood involved, I mean it's a script that I couldn't have written better myself.""",7,8.627415250831548
27cf4572f7fa2ddf8f8660d1c102ba328f2f83a7,CNN,"(CNN) -- Some people take many years to find their calling in life -- but for Adam van Koeverden, it was right in front of him in black and white. On a small section of his local newspaper, the Canadian boy who would become an Olympic champion saw his future flash before him. An advert, in the otherwise unremarkable Oakville Beaver, had caught his mother's eye. It was calling out for the next kayak superstar -- and her son had already tried everything else without much success. ""It was one of those turning points in your life where you look back and you're like, 'Wow that day really changed the rest of my life quite significantly,' "" van Koeverden told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It was a long time ago now. I wonder what would have happened with me and where I'd be today if instead of that newspaper article, my mum was reading something different or brought me down to another sports club? Or didn't at all? I think about that a lot."" As a 13-year-old who had tried his hand at a whole host of sports including soccer, basketball and volleyball, it was the kayak which caught the imagination of a determined teenager. After his first foray into the world of paddling, there was never a chance he'd turn back. ""Every kid wants to have something to brag about. I tried out for all the teams growing up but I just wasn't really showing any signs of any athletic prowess,"" van Koeverden said. ""In kayaking it was the sort of a thing I could go out there and practice on my own. It took a lot of concentration."" Unknown quantity . Some 18 years have passed since he first picked up a paddle, but van Koeverden has lost none of the boyish enthusiasm which propelled him from an unknown to one of the sport's most famous stars. From arriving as a virtual unknown at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he won gold in the K1 500-meter event and bronze in the K1 1,000-meter race, he went on to establish himself as an icon of the sport. But even now, with four Olympic medals, two World Championship wins and 26 World Cup stage victories to his name, van Koeverden is still desperate for more success. The opportunity to compete at Rio in 2016 is a huge lure for the man who grew up dreaming of the day he would compete at the greatest Games on earth. And at the age of 31, that dream still remains -- perhaps burning even stronger. Rio Games . ""I've definitely committed to Rio,"" he said. ""I'm training like I'm training for the Olympics, and it's just difficult committing to something that's so far away. ""I really have enjoyed the process of diversification and trying new things but I can't really get away from the fact that I'm a kayaker and I love to race, and there's a big race happening in Brazil in a couple of years' time. ""I'm not going to be too old for it. I don't want to retire ... but I don't want to be washed up. I don't want to be the old guy on the water. ""I don't want to think about retirement and I hope the next phase of my life is just as rewarding and provides me with the same opportunity to work hard."" Climbing peaks . Van Koeverden has stood on top of the world -- in more ways than one -- but he has not lost sight of the smaller things in life. The man who walked into Beijing's Bird Nest stadium holding the Maple Leaf aloft in 2008 is now busy flying the flag for children across the world who can only dream of becoming a Olympic hero. In November last year, van Koeverden climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania for charity Right to Play. By ascending the world's tallest freestanding mountain -- its peak is 5,895 meters (19,336 feet) above sea level -- he and six others helped to raise over $100,000 for children across the world. The scheme runs a whole host of educational programs which include seminars on AIDS and HIV, conflict resolution, healthy active living, sanitation and cleanliness. Van Koeverden proudly sports a ""Right to Play"" sticker on his kayak -- something which he is often asked about. ""When I'm racing my boat in Europe people always ask me, 'Is that like a gaming site, are they like your sponsors?' ""It's a good conversation starter because they don't know it's a charity that I do some work with. ""They're a children-focused charity that is helping to improve lives for those who aren't fortunate enough to be able to say that they can take sport and play for granted. ""Unfortunately it's not something everybody globally can take for granted. ""When I was 13, I just wandered into a canoe club and had access to a competitive sport with great coaching and great facility. ""That's just not available to everybody, so it's great that the Right to Play is bridging that gap and leveling the playing field."" A bigger picture . Despite a hectic competition schedule and his constant traveling, the opportunity to help others remains a driving force for van Koeverden. ""It comes down to priorities,"" he added. ""I'm tremendously fortunate to be able to do a sport for my living and be a full-time athlete, so any spare time that I have, I should be able to devote to these sorts of efforts. ""It's easy to turn a blind eye or forget when you're so focused on moving a kayak, like how obscure that is and how selfish it is in the long run because, really, I can't think of a more selfish sport. ""I'm in a little boat all by myself out on the water paddling as fast I can every single day just so I can go and win a kayak race. ""While I feel very fortunate, I also know there's a bigger picture and there's other things out there that we need to consider and if I can be a part of that then I will.""",7,7.035542242992454
1a992b7fdc97bc77934d9b9f37d55d185d3c70d2,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- FBI Deputy Director John Pistole appears before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday for the first of two confirmation hearings to become the head of the Transportation Security Administration. The position has  been vacant since Barack Obama became president in January 2009, with an acting head  in place. Two previous Obama nominees have withdrawn from consideration due to Republican opposition and controversial issues. Pistole has been FBI deputy director since October 2004, and previously helped lead the investigation of the Egypt Air Flight 990 crash off Rhode Island in 1999. ""The talent and knowledge John has acquired in more than two decades of service with the FBI will make him a valuable asset to our administration's efforts to strengthen the security and screening measures at our airports,"" Obama said in a written statement in May when he announced the nomination. ""I am grateful that he has agreed to take on this important role, and I look forward to working with him in the weeks and months ahead."" Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano immediately endorsed Pistole, calling him uniquely qualified for the job that involves counter-terrorism efforts. ""John's national security and counterterrorism expertise will be a great asset to the Department in our efforts to enhance the security of our vital transportation systems,"" Napolitano said in a statement. Two senators involved in security issues - Republican Susan Collins of Maine and independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut - also praised Pistole as a sound choice. ""Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, he has been on the forefront of our nation's fight against terrorism,"" Collins said in a statement, while Lieberman said Pistole ""understands the threat of terrorism as well as anyone in the government."" The TSA, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, oversees national aviation safety. It has 60,000 employees, including the approximately 50,000 Transportation Security Officers who provide security at airport screening checkpoints and elsewhere. Napolitano's statement said that if confirmed by the Senate, Pistole would oversee the Homeland Security Department's ""ongoing efforts to secure the nation's aviation networks, railroads, ports and mass transit systems, security operations for 450 federalized airports throughout the nation, and the Federal Air Marshal Service."" The position has proven difficult to fill for Obama. His two previous nominees, Los Angeles Airport police department official Erroll Southers and retired Maj. Gen. Robert Harding both removed themselves from consideration for the post. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, put a hold on Southers' nomination after Southers declined to say whether he supported unionization of airport screeners. Southers eventually withdrew his name from consideration after another controversy erupted involving a decades-old personnel matter. Harding, withdrew his name from consideration in March after acknowledging that his security company overbilled the government for work performed in Iraq in 2004. At that time, the head of the 25,000-member Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Jon Adler, said the TSA ""cannot continue to operate on autopilot."" Adler said his organization fully supports Pistole's nomination. ""Since the last two nominees withdrew, we re-emphasized to Secretary Napolitano the need to select someone who combines a national law enforcement background with credible intel(ligence) experience,"" Adler said in an e-mail to CNN in May. ""We are appreciative of her responsiveness to our recommendation. Deputy Director Pistole possesses the necessary skill set to lead TSA forward from a position of strength.""",3,5.532441966764069
34001f4a2cc62de091fb2ceef7b9cf3fbff0dbc0,CNN,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan may set standards for long-term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top government official said Thursday, as a strong new aftershock rattled the area . Government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long-term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. ""It is the time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure,"" Edano, the government's point man on the crisis, told reporters Thursday evening. ""The safety of the people is the first priority, and social needs come after that."" There is no timetable for a decision, Edano said. Residents within a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out the plant's power systems. Those living within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors. But readings released Thursday by the country's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long-term exposure could top the government's one-time standards for an evacuation within a few months. Some of those are in towns to the northwest, where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. ""We have been asking a team of the specialists about setting the line to evacuate by accumulated exposure to radiation,"" Edano said. The recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long-term risk of cancer, according to medical experts. The anti-nuclear group Greenpeace and the International Atomic Energy Agency raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30-kilometer zone in late March. Current regulations require an evacuation after radiation levels exceed 50 millisieverts in a short period of time. But cumulative doses in one area near Fukushima Daiichi have already topped 12 millisieverts in the month since the accident, and several readings are roughly double the 3 millisieverts a resident of a typical industrialized country receives in a year, according to science ministry data. Edano said the government is also considering whether to allow the roughly 78,000 people who have been forced to evacuate the area around the plant to return temporarily, ""but it is not easy, because we need to secure their safety."" Troops and police who have been working in the area are wearing protective clothing and equipment, ""so it is not realistic that they can go anywhere, anytime,"" he said. At the damaged plant, engineers began injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor Thursday to counter a buildup of potentially explosive hydrogen. That work continued even after a strong aftershock rattled much of central Japan shortly before midnight, the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, reported early Friday. The nine workers in the plant retreated to an earthquake-resistant shelter during the temblor, and the plant never lost power, the utility said. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was a magnitude of 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was 7.1. Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami. The nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell, reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance Tokyo Electric called ""extremely low."" A hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the No 1. reactor building two days after the quake, and another blast two days later blew apart the No. 3 building. A suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the No. 2 reactor on March 15 as well. Tokyo Electric and Japanese regulators believe No. 2 is the source of the highly contaminated water they are now struggling to contain at Fukushima Daiichi, 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Plant workers are pouring 8 tons of water (2,100 gallons) into that reactor every hour to keep it cool, and the water that flows out carries extremely high concentrations of radioactive particles. That highly radioactive fluid is building up in the turbine plant and the service tunnels around the unit, leaving Japanese officials grasping for ways to contain it. Until Wednesday, some of that water had been bleeding out into the Pacific Ocean through a cracked utility shaft behind the plant. On Saturday, the day the leak was discovered, concentrations of the reactor byproduct iodine-131 in seawater next to the shaft were 7.5 million times higher than the legal limit, according to sampling data taken by the utility. Those levels prompted Japanese authorities to start dumping nearly 10,000 tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific on Monday night, largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the No. 2 reactor coolant. The move enraged the country's fishing industry and drew protests from neighboring South Korea, but Japan's government called it an emergency move to prevent a worse discharge. Japan is currently consulting with Russian authorities on whether a shipborne decontamination plant has the capability to handle the wastewater, the Japanese Foreign Ministry told CNN on Thursday. But Tokyo has not yet asked for the vessel to be brought into the fight, said Tomosaburo Esaki, an official with the ministry's arms control and disarmament division. The ship, the Suzeran (Lily of the Valley), can process up to 35 tons of radioactive waste a day and store about 800 tons. Japan built the vessel for Russia in the 1990s to help Moscow take aging nuclear submarines out of service. Sergey Novikov, a spokesman for Russia's state-run nuclear energy company, Rosatom, told CNN that, ""The ball is now in their court."" ""We have responded to their questions regarding the plant, and they sent us their additional questions, to which we responded as well,"" Novikov said. ""They are still studying this issue, and we hope to hear from them soon."" Reactors 1 to 3 are believed to have suffered damage to the fuel assemblies at their cores from overheating after the quake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi. Stopping the flow of radioactive water from No. 2 was a victory for plant workers, but Tokyo Electric and a top Japanese official warned the fight is far from over. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said Wednesday that the now-contained water ""may lead to more leakage somewhere else,"" and the utility said Thursday that the water level in the basement of the unit's turbine plant had gone up about 4 centimeters (0.8 inches) since the leak was plugged. The company says temporary storage tanks that can hold another 15,000 tons of water are expected to arrive late next week, but will need to be connected to pumps and water lines before they can be put to use.

eb3ea433592d7a487dd0b82664ab12e12366991f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Dinosaur skeletons illegally smuggled in to the United States have been turned over to the Mongolian government in a repatriation ceremony Thursday. U.S. authorities officially turned over 18 dinosaur skeletons -- including a ""nearly complete"" Tyrannosaurs Bataar, Saurolophus Angustirostris, and an Oviraptor, a fossilized egg and a ""grave yard"" containing the remains of at least five dinosaurs. During the ceremony, U .S. Attorney Preet Bharara and James T. Hayes, Jr., Special Agent in Charge at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) returned the historic items to Od Och, Mongolia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. ""A recovery of this sort is really without precedent,"" said Bharara. ""This is a historic event for the U.S. Attorney's office as well as a prehistoric event."" On display, was a multicolored egg that looks much like a rock, a large rock containing the remains of multiple Oviraptors, and another rock with two well preserved Gallimimus. The looted fossils are 68 to 80 million years old and originated from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which had much more water at the time, said paleontologist Mark Norell during the ceremony. The bones were disassembled into many pieces before being smuggled through customs between 2005 and 2012, said Hayes. The Department of Homeland Security Investigations seized the skeletons from a commercial paleontologist, Eric Prokopi, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to smuggling and other charges. Prokopi had a ""vast inventory"" of historical items in a number of locations under his control, said Hayes. In June, Prokopi was sentenced to three months in jail and one year and three months supervised release on charges related to smuggling, conspiracy, and sale or receipt of stolen goods, according to ICE. Under Mongolian law, dinosaur fossils are property of the Mongolian government and exporting them from the country is a criminal offense. Och expressed his appreciation to the U.S. attorney and the agencies involved in the recovery. ""This can be seen as best practice of international cooperation to fight organized crime,"" Och said. The skeletons returned to the Mongolian government are very important, said Norell. ""They are extraordinarily rare."" Prokopi was also at the center of a 2013 investigation that led to the recovery and reparation of a ""nearly complete"" skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar to the Mongolian government. Bharara and ICE turned over a skeleton standing 8 feet tall and stretching 24 feet in length after it was illegally smuggled and changed hands several times, including being sold at auction. ""The fossils returned today do not belong in the hands of any private collection or one owner,"" said Hayes. ""They belong to the people of Mongolia where they will be displayed in their national museum alongside the Bataar ICS repatriated last year.""

ca78ee6ab972a5dbc1fa6debc28f99f054a4b3cf,CNN,"(CNN) -- It hurts me to say this, but I bet when I say ""Kim,"" you know the last name. Our world is no longer run by bankers and brokers but by public relations people who will do anything to keep certain names in (or out) of the news. If they are not trained psychologists, they sure act like them; they know how to get our interest even when we absolutely do not want to give it. And so into this vortex of extreme public relations savvy comes Kim K, one of the people who is ""famous for being famous."" How did she do it? By flaunting her vapid lifestyle, her great body and good looks and her money. Of course America idolizes her. But as it turns out, not nearly so much as she idolizes herself. Kim is putting together a big book of selfies called ""Selfish."" She said she was assembling sexy pictures of herself from a trip to Southeast Asia for a book to give to her newish husband, Kanye West, on Valentine's Day. But then the thought occurred to her -- why wouldn't everyone want one? Normal people would find a 352-page compilation of selfies in bad taste. But in truth we recognize the basic instinct: It's hard to resist walking by a mirror and not having one of two reactions -- to look or, at all costs, to avoid looking. Unlike Kim K, the Queen of Narcissism, most of us have a more ambivalent relationship to our own image. We look at pictures of ourselves and more often than not, cringe. If it's a flattering picture, we save it for our Facebook page or give it to our partner. But few of us, even few movie stars, want to create books of how glorious we look. Yes we all are mini-narcissists, but most of us have a sense of our flaws and the limits of how much time we should spend on adoringly looking at our own image. Kim K is a lesson in how extreme it can get when you are a canny self-promoter: You just love yourself so much 24/7. If you, like me, is relieved at the disappearance of Paris Hilton from the front pages and are not a fan of pathological narcissism, you know we should ignore Kim K and shun falling into her PR trap. But the fact that she has an esteemed publisher and that the editors there must think this book will sell well presents a serious issue: Why are young women entranced with this woman? (I understand why young men would be.) But young girls who are easily impressionable and hooked by hype may be enchanted with the ease with which she seems to float through life and take on her ""struggles"" (Which brand name shall I buy? Which mini-feud will I rage about?) as ones they would rather have than the ones they have in real life. They envy her. The fact is that the Kardashians have gained traction in their lives. They have built an empire and no one can deny she and her posse have figured out how to make a fortune based on her brand. Kim K won't be around forever. But is it some failure of feminism among the young that allows this kind of person to be a star? I remember the icons of my day: Janis Joplin -- a wild woman, a maverick and a massive talent (though, sadly an addict as well). There's Gloria Steinem, a woman who was mission driven. And while perhaps she had extra press attention because she was good-looking, it was her feminist theory, her amazing verbal ability and her mentoring of others that made her someone to follow and emulate. These were women who deserved to be famous. Even Madonna, embellished by PR but not created by it, had (and has) talent, and a provocative message about sexuality. Kim K, like Paris Hilton, is just about as thin as their photographs. They want our love and money and they hope to achieve it by showing how much love and money they have already. So wouldn't it be great if Kim K's selfie book sat moldering in book stores and on Amazon? That would reassure me about the soul of modern girls and young women. I wouldn't blame anyone for paging through it. It's a little like a car wreck -- awful, but hard to totally avoid looking at. But buying the book is another thing altogether. Instead of sending Kim K to the bank, let's encourage her to go to a really good therapist. This kind of narcissism needs to be treated, not celebrated.",7,14.491924654840663

ff366b69b1772579c3cbe6c25d53e99bda5759bc,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The early favorite to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination walks a tightrope. Hillary Clinton has said she is in no hurry to decide whether she'll seek the White House. But the former secretary of state, first lady and senator stokes the assumption that she's in the game for a second time with every move she makes. Such status raises a question: how much time does someone in her position want to spend in the limelight at such an early stage and with no indication she will even run? Clinton jumps back into fray with speech on voting rights . After years immersed in foreign affairs as America's top diplomat, Clinton has begun to reemerge on the public stage. She is starting to carefully weigh in on domestic issues and devote more time to her family's foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative. She jumped into highly charged political issues on race in a speech on Monday in San Francisco -- sharply criticizing efforts to roll back the Voting Rights Act as well the Republican-led drive in some states to require voter identification. ""Not every obstacle is related to race, but anyone who says that racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention,"" Clinton said in her remarks to a group of fellow lawyers. ""And despite the best efforts of many well-intentioned election officials, discrepancies and resources across precincts and polling stations still disproportionately affect African-American, Latino, and young voters."" Weiner says he knows wife's role with Clinton in 2016 . For Clinton, her appearance before the American Bar Association raised a few more eyebrows and is seen as a sign of things to come. â€¢ She announced in Monday's remarks that she would deliver a string of policy speeches in the coming months, including one in September on national security. â€¢ Clinton is also writing a memoir due to be released in 2014. â€¢ Next month, Clinton will host a fundraiser at her Washington home for Terry McAuliffe, a close family friend, mega-fundraiser, and the Democratic nominee for governor in the presidential battleground of Virginia. All of this -- the political stances, the fundraising help and the glossy memoir -- has fueled speculation Clinton is already running for president. She even has groups urging her to run -- like The Ready for Hillary Super Pac that raised $1.25 million in the second quarter of 2013 -- as well as organizations that are questioning her credentials and laying the groundwork to oppose a run. N.H. Democrats raise money off Hillary Clinton attacks . ""This keeps her out there. It keeps her prominent in the national debate, keeps her prominently talking about the issues that will matter in 2016,"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. ""While publicly she tells her aides to say her inclination is not to run, she is preparing to run and she is doing everything she has to do to be ready to run."" King said that it appears Clinton is trying to walk the line between being seen as resting on her front-runner status and enjoying the fact that she has the name recognition and prestige to wait longer than most anyone else. Clinton, Christie hot, others not . The fact that Clinton is again making appearances has generated commentary over what kind of message she would want to articulate. ""At the moment, her only one (message) is that she is a woman,"" writes Richard Cohen in an opinion piece in Tuesday's Washington Post. ""Becoming the first female president is a worthy goal, but it kind of falls into the category of miles traveled and countries visited. It is an achievement, even a stunning one, but it is not a stirring trumpet call."" Cohen's piece has been roundly criticized -- largely because Clinton has yet to launch any campaign. But the fact that he wrote the column speaks to the larger point: whatever Clinton does in the near term will further fuel speculation about a candidacy. This is not lost on Republicans. By all indications, Clinton is the most feared potential Democratic presidential candidate. A number of groups, including the Stop Hillary PAC, have begun raising money to derail any effort to run before it could get started. Anti-Hillary groups to beef up forces . Other possible Democratic candidates -- namely Vice President Joe Biden -- have not received that kind of attention. Biden jokes about co-hosting with Hillary . ""She knows exactly what she is doing,"" King said. ""It is a signal to all of those people who are urging her to run -- 'Look, I can't give you that answer.

36ceda301f18a561f63af253bdc0cdb7846a1e27,CNN,"(CNN) -- Grapple fans should head to Mongolia each year on July 11. It's the day the country celebrates its independence, but also the beginning of something equally important: country-wide competitions to discover Mongolia's top wrestler. The wrestle-fest is part of ""naadam"", the annual celebration of traditional Mongolian sports -- wrestling, archery and horse-racing -- that captivates villages, towns and cities across the country for three days. The grand wrestling competition held in the capital Ulaanbaatar is only open to those with a national ranking. But at a local level men, women and children, some as young as four years old, take part in the events. Sporting traditional garb, the reason for the wrestlers' frontless shirts comes from a folktale. It tells of a woman who was disguised as a man and won the wrestling event. To avoid any deception again, wrestlers from then on had to compete bare-chested. While there is plenty of machismo on show, and despite the fact that the festival is often referred to as the ""three manly games,"" women can compete in the archery competition and girls can ride as jockeys in the horse racing. ""Everyone loves horse racing in Mongolia; it's our national sport,"" says Battsetseg Erdenekhuu, who works as a guide for adventure tourists in Mongolia. The annual event has become one of the biggest attractions for tourists visiting the country. Erdenekhuu believes that despite the influx of visitors the games are still as authentic as they have ever been because of their importance to local communities. ""For the main games of wrestling, archery and horse racing, it's still very traditional,"" she says. ""For the naadam opening ceremony in Ulaanbaatar, because more tourists come just for that, it's a bit touristy as there are different shows held just for them."" Local and regional competitions are held across the country, with anyone able to compete in the events. Competitors and competition organizers usually spend around two months training and practicing before the events begin. Like most celebrations anywhere, food is just as important for the festivities, with deep-fried meat dumplings -- ""khuushuur"" -- the most popular dish. ""Naadam with no khuushuur is not a complete naadam,"" says Erdenekhuu. As a celebration of Mongolia's nomadic past, the games will undoubtedly persist, believes Erdenekhuu. But she worries that the fast pace of change in the country with the current boom in mining could diminish the type of life the games commemorate. ""Visitors to the countryside and naadam will find it's still very authentic,"" she says. ""The city is different. Nomad life is very authentic but I'm sure its going to change in a few years.""",7,10.90096461712363
01b6139a9ed19d594a51210d3ac5a3052606b7ce,CNN,"(CNN) -- Fearing that flocks of unmanned aircraft might soon traverse U.S. skies, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday quickly appealed a judge's ruling that the agency does not have the authority to regulate commercial drones. The case involves Raphael Pirker, a drone enthusiast fined $10,000 by the FAA for using his 56-inch foam glider to take promotional videos of the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA said Pirker's flight ran afoul of its strict rules governing the commercial use of drones. On Friday, less than 24 hours after losing its case, the FAA said it was appealing the decision by Patrick Geraghty, an administrative law judge with the National Transportation Safety Board. ""The agency is concerned that this decision could impact ... the safety of people and property on the ground,"" the FAA said in a statement. Geraghty said FAA regulations approved for manned aircraft did not apply to unmanned aircraft any more than they applied to paper airplanes or balsa wood planes. Pirker's attorney, Brendan Schulman, called it ""a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators."" ""As a general matter, the decision finds that the FAA's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable. It would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators,"" Schulman said. But the decision confounded the FAA, which as recently as last week had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. In a press release headlined ""Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft,"" it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. ""A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. To date, only one operation has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle, and authorization was limited to the Arctic,"" the FAA's Busting Myths release said. ""There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations,"" the FAA continued. ""Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval."" The flight that got Pirker in trouble occurred October 17, 2011, when he remotely piloted a $130 RiteWing Zephyr II aircraft at the campus medical center. The FAA investigated, and the following April it proposed a $10,000 civil penalty, saying that Pirker operated the plane ""in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another."" Pirker operated the aircraft within about 50 feet of numerous individuals, about 20 feet of a crowded street, and within approximately 100 feet of an active heliport at UVA, the FAA alleged. One person had to take ""evasive measures"" to avoid being struck by the aircraft, the agency said. Pirker appealed the case to the NTSB, where the case went before Geraghty.

The product being recalled is: El Guapo Nuez Entera / Shelled Walnuts sold in 1-ounce packages, UPC 4498933144, date code 5527. The code date is embossed on the front of the package under the El Guapo banner. The company, Mojave Food Corporation, said it is recalling the product because they were informed by the walnut supplier of the salmonella concern. No illnesses have been reported. Consumers are asked to destroy the product, and contact the Mojave customer service number at 1-800-995-8906, ext. 114, for a replacement or reimbursement. Salmonella infections are caused by bacteria and if necessary can be treated with antibiotics, although some strains have become resistant to these drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Most people infected will develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection, and their illness can last up to a week. Most recover without any treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and in severe cases require hospitalization. The youngest and oldest patients and chronically ill people with compromised immune systems are at highest risk for severe complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.",2,11.137860211106203
fac40afc535030696312863d46872c75a6aa82d4,CNN,"(CNN) -- At least 26 bodies have been recovered from the sea after a Libyan trawler got into trouble last week, but hundreds are still missing, according to Tunisia's state-run TAP news agency. Bad weather is preventing the recovery of more bodies, the head of the Sfax coast guard told TAP Monday. The agency did not name the official. As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the Mediterranean Sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported last week. The Tunisian coast guard responded to the rescue call regarding the fishing trawler, which became disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands. The ship was reportedly taking some 800 refugees from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa, TAP reported. Between 200 and 270 people were missing, while 577 people were rescued, the coast guard official told TAP Monday. People on the boat began pushing each other in a panic to reach the lifeboats when they ran into high waves and winds, TAP said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered Lampedusa's residents, who number about 6,000.",7,10.141653852875246
b8bbf3778856faaa025afc21f48db0fbbe199bd3,CNN,"(CNN) -- David Bill isn't annoyed when Twitter gets so bogged down with traffic that he can't post a message. Twitter's ""fail whale,"" which appears when the site is overrun, is so popular it's on T-shirts and even tattoos. That's because in the moment when frustration would hit, he's greeted on the popular Web site by a cartoonish image he loves: a giant whale being lifted out of an ocean by a small flock of tweeting birds. The icon -- which Twitter users call it the ""fail whale"" because the creature appears only when the site has failed to load -- has gained a cult following as the social media site grows at breakneck pace. The conversational Web site, which lets users post 140-character microblogs, saw a 1,374 percent jump in unique visitors between February 2008 and February this year, up to 7 million from only 475,000, according to Nielsen NetView. By comparison, Facebook grew 228 percent, to 65.7 million users, during the same period. With all of those new Twitterers, fail whale sightings and site crashes seem more frequent. Bill (mr_bill on Twitter) and other fail-whale followers aren't bothered, though. The 36-year-old San Franciscan has organized parties in honor of the whale. The most recent, held in California in February, was attended by more than 300 people, including Yiying Lu, the artist in Australia who created the image. Bill says the whale represents a contrarian philosophy. ""It's sort of an adorable whale but also this thing that represents the Herculean tasks that we sometimes go about from day to day,"" he said. ""We're all trying to do a lot of things that seem pretty impossible,"" Bill said. ""It's nice to identify something positive with those failures."" Not every Twitterer is sympathetic to the site's troubles, though. Some users say Twitter has outgrown its core audience and is irrelevant to the technophiles who made it popular in the first place. Others are annoyed by the flood of spammers and profiteers who now use the site's popularity to make a buck. Celebrities and members of Congress have been jumping onto the site in recent months, adding to the site's mainstream popularity and, some users say, causing glitches in the system. ""I keep getting the fail whale. Twitter got too popular too quickly. I blame Shaq,"" wrote Jessica Roy, a 21-year-old New York University student who goes by suchamessica on Twitter. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, or THE_REAL_SHAQ, has more than 470,000 followers on the site. Nova Spivack, a blogger whose article ""Can Twitter Survive What is About to Happen to It?"" has been passed around the site, said a rift is developing between Twitter's original ""in crowd"" and its newer, more mainstream users. Early adopters find many of the new users annoying, he said. ""A lot of people come in, and they take that 'What are you doing?' question literally, and so they put very inane things on Twitter,"" he said. iReport.com: How do you feel about tweets and status updates? The site used to feel ""insulated"" from the mainstream, and now it doesn't, he said. But for all the complaints, there seem to be just as many people who are almost excited about Twitter's growing pains. It is inevitable that a Web site seeing Twitter-style growth would face some glitches and a backlash from early adopters, said Laura Fitton, a consultant and co-author of the book ""Twitter for Dummies."" ""There's going to be all kinds of people using it all kinds of different ways,"" she said. ""The purists can go pound rocks."" Major news such as the Mumbai terrorist attacks and the Hudson River plane landing has broken over Twitter, and that's added to the site's popularity, she said. Amy Gahran, who writes on social media at contentious.com, said the backlash against Twitter stems from the fact that people are uncomfortable with change. Early users see new people coming to the site, and that creeps them out, but it shouldn't, she said. ""Change is freaking good,"" she said. ""Roll with it."" As the site gets filled with fresh users, people are creating pieces of software to help Twitterers sort through the noise, Gahran said. She said Twitter is popular because it mimics real-life conversation and because it's easy to use. She also expects Twitter to expand, especially as people in developing countries use cell-phone text messages to communicate through the site. ""People talk. That's what we do,"" she said. ""We're social creatures. We're kind of wired for this."" Twitter says it is addressing breakdowns in that wired communication. ""We have made amazing progress from a technical perspective as far as accommodating this rapid growth goes and will continue to improve system and subsystem performance moving forward,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote in a statement to CNN. Critter Gewlas of Cary, North Carolina, believes so much in the site's ability to overcome adversity that he recently got a tattoo of the fail whale on his leg. ""The site itself has suffered a few scrapes and bumps along the way, but for the most part, I definitely think it's a good thing,"" said the 36-year-old. The fail whale's account on Twitter has more than 2,265 followers. A Facebook group dedicated to the whale has more than 4,400 members. The whale has spawned art and merchandise, from coffee mugs to baby clothes. A Current.com parody of the whale has spun around the Internet, too. Bill, whose fail whale parties have featured an aquamarine martini in honor of the icon's color, said the whale's popularity comes from the idea that failures are worth celebrating and learning from. Twitter will use that philosophy to continue to grow, he said. ""Twitter is a powerful enough thing that it should succeed in a broad way, and I would like it to succeed in a broad way,"" he said.",6,8.820560839944507
61d9188740ec0b637fac1dec4eb45a2d018afe77,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The case: routine. One man's summary of the facts: anything but. Chief Justice John Roberts shows his writing chops in a dissenting Supreme Court opinion. The man in this case is the top man at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts, who on Tuesday turned a brief dissent in a criminal appeal into something straight out of a Dashiell Hammett detective novel. He offered his thoughts in a case about whether a police officer's arrest of a drug suspect was proper. Let Roberts tell the story in his own words: . ""North Philly, May 4, 2001. Officer Sean Devlin, Narcotics Strike Force, was working the morning shift. Undercover surveillance. The neighborhood? Tough as a three-dollar steak. Devlin knew. Five years on the beat, nine months with the Strike Force. He'd made fifteen, twenty drug busts in the neighborhood. ""Devlin spotted him: a lone man in the corner. Another approached. Quick exchange of words. Cash handed over; small objects handed back. Each man then quickly on his own way. Devlin knew the guy wasn't buying bus tokens. He radioed a description and Officer Stein picked up the buyer. Sure enough: three bags of crack [cocaine] in the guy's pocket. Head downtown and book him. Just another day at the office."" The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ultimately tossed out the suspect's conviction on possession of a controlled substance. Seven of Roberts colleagues rejected an opportunity to fully hear the state's appeal, prompting his turn at creative opinion-writing. Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed with Roberts' conclusions, if not his flair for Sam Spade-style rhetoric. Roberts later got serious in his dissent, writing, ""I think the police clearly had probable cause to arrest the defendant."" This is not the first time the 53-year-old chief justice has spiced up his writings with cultural references. In a July dissent in an especially dry case over who can file certain lawsuits, he quoted singer Bob Dylan. Or misquoted him. Amid arcane talk of legal standing and redressability, the youngest member of the high court showed his generational bearings by citing part of the lyrics from Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone."" ""The absence of any right to the substantive recovery means that respondents cannot benefit from the judgment they seek and thus lack Article III standing. 'When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.' "" Roberts then acknowledged the line came from the singer's 1965 album ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and even helpfully added the record label in parentheses (Columbia Records). Court historians will note it is very likely the first time a rock lyric was cited in a high court opinion. But in a profession that values accuracy, Roberts got it wrong. The actual lyric on ""Highway 61 Revisited"" goes, ""When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose"" -- note the word ""ain't."" The elusive ""ain't"" has been debated by Dylan scholars. Dylan's own Web site, bobdylan.com, does not include ""ain't"" in the lyrics. Other references are divided on the issue, and there are certainly recorded versions of the song that don't include it.  But at least on ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" Dylan does indeed say ""ain't."" Perhaps the law clerks provided Roberts with an incorrect citation. Or maybe the chief justice just remembered the line differently from his younger, less stuffy days. The chief justice never explained the reasons behind his literary leanings. He doesn't have to.",1,9.684807230597558
a0f7afc4a6e9466b405255838b17cc24fc293425,CNN,"(CNN) -- Elan Gale, producer of ""The Bachelor,"" is under heat for his live-tweet-turned-hoax aboard US Airways over Thanksgiving weekend. His live tweets about a feud with a disgruntled passenger went viral and garnered him tons of attention and sympathy. Turned out the whole thing was made up. Gale admitted it on Twitter. Should Gale not have made up the woman in 7a whom he called Diane? Maybe. But then again he's in the creative industry. He's a writer. To me, what's more fascinating is how quick we are to jump on any interesting human interaction. Gale conceived of a short story on Twitter and it was so good that hungry media outlets seized on it and spread the story like wildfire. If Gale wanted publicity, he got it. If the media wanted a good and verified story, it should have done its job of fact-checking. Gale just happened to live-tweet a fiction. But the bigger issue is: Is it OK to live-tweet other people's conversations? Based on my own experiences, I'd say yes, to an extent. A few weeks ago, it was an unusually warm night in Brooklyn. I had a friend in town and we went up to the roof to enjoy the view. More groups of people came up and cluttered the smallish space. Suddenly a couple burst on to the roof. Simply put, they began breaking up on the roof, in front of everyone. It all seemed so familiar to me, the back and forth, the arguing between the couple. I'll tweet out what they're saying, I thought. I didn't think too much about it. It just seemed like a relatable situation. The breakup, #roofbreakup as it became known, started to pick up steam, and eventually went viral. I began to receive messages and tweets and e-mails from all over the world, with the overwhelming majority expressing their delight and joy in reading the tweet-sized transcript. But not everyone condones this behavior. Nisha Chittal, a social media content editor at MSNBC, posted an essay on Medium entitled, ""Please stop live-tweeting people's private conversations."" Chittal mentions my #roofbreakup, Gale's airplane feud (before it was revealed to be a hoax), a date someone overheard on Amtrak, and the time where Tom Matzzie overheard former NSA director Michael Hayden's phone conversation with reporters. Chittal says she believes it to be ""unethical and unfair to regular people to broadcast their lives to an audience against their will."" She's right in some ways. However, except in the case of Michael Hayden, the people in her examples are anonymous. They just as easily could have been fiction, as in the case of Gale's airplane feud, where the characters existed in an invented scenario to evoke people's sympathy. But there is no harm if a conversation with universal appeal is shared publicly as long as the people remain anonymous. For example, with my own live-tweeting of #roofbreakup, I didn't give any clues as to who the couple were. When sifting through the endless responses sent my way in the wake of #roofbreakup, time and time again I came across ""oh I've been there before"" and ""sounds like my last breakup."" The only explanation for the level of exposure that my #roofbreakup got is that people connected with the situation. It was gossiping in the 21st century, except instead of using specifics and pointing out the people, it remained ""guy"" and ""Rachel."" I didn't live-tweet a couple's private conversation; I live-tweeted any two people's breakup conversation. Technology is quickly changing our lives and we are adapting accordingly. It's so easy to communicate and share information and knowledge instantly. And now we have to deal with having private conversations in public spaces. But private and public are not always distinctly drawn lines. Sometimes the two mesh and things get blurry. As humans, we're intrigued with the lives of other people. When other people's lives parallel ours, we feel less alone in the world. The media knows this. Just as often as you read a headline about a natural disaster, you will see a headline about a personal disaster. Elaborate proposal videos go viral daily. Couples fighting in public get on YouTube. Go ahead and share the story you overheard on the street or cafe, just make sure to not give away the personal identities. A story with no specific names attached is no less fake than fiction. You may wonder: Did the #roofbreakup really happen? You can believe me or not, but I promise you it did. Had I witnessed the breakup on my roof five or six years ago, I would have told everyone I knew about the crazy exchange. I would have walked back into my apartment and re-enacted it for my then roommates, embellishing and recalling every line I possibly could. But I witnessed the breakup in 2013, and I communicated it in a way that seemed just as normal as any other. It just happens that I can tell the story to more people.

95f641cd7611d0cd2b81e9aa398560dd8839206c,CNN,"(CNN)  -- Four years since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake spawned massive walls of water that swept across the Indian Ocean, leaving more than 230,000 dead according to a United Nations estimate, improvements can be seen in many of the devastated areas, humanitarian groups said. Laborers work on a construction site in a fishing village in Indonesia's Aceh on December 21. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and jobless after the tsunami, and poor and isolated communities were left even worse off. Today, new schools have been constructed, and armies of workers -- many of them volunteers -- have cleared and rebuilt homes and towns, and helped get people back to work. ""The tsunami, despite being a horrific event, also provided a lot of opportunities for those countries,"" said Jonathan Cauldwell, chief of UNICEF's Tsunami Transition Support. ""It brought a peace dividend within Banda Aceh (Indonesia) where you still see peace in an area which had long term localized conflict in place. It allowed those areas to be built up as well, to have investments in the infrastructure in the social sectors ...,"" he added. Agencies such as UNICEF said that while the immediate emergency was over, they remain committed to improving the lives of millions of children across the region. ""The lessons of the tsunami will never end. The funding will end, we can complete the construction, we can complete the project, but the intervention never ends ...,"" Cauldwell said. Oxfam International, which said it will close its response to the tsunami at the end of December, said it has provided housing to tsunami survivors in Aceh, helped restore the livelihoods of people in India and Sri Lanka, and funded the reconstruction of eight tsunami-affected secondary schools. ""The money we received allowed us not only to help meet the immediate emergency needs of tsunami-affected populations, but also to try to address the factors that made them vulnerable: not least poverty and a lack of influence over their own lives,"" Barbara Stocking, chair of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund Board, said in a statement. ""What has been achieved is astounding. Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in better conditions than they were in before the tsunami ...,"" she added. UNICEF said the basic needs of children affected by the tsunami have been met -- more children are going to school as a result of improved facilities, and better nutrition, post-natal care and other life-saving interventions are helping those countries worst hit transition to developing regular services and programs. But long-term improvement of water and sanitation is critical, the agency said, and so is building new schools that are better able to withstand earthquakes. According to UNICEF and Oxfam, the response to the tsunami and the lessons learned have changed the way they deal with such emergencies. It highlighted the need for better coordination among partners and other organizations, and contributed to reforms in the way humanitarian relief is delivered.",2,10.110800686405286
e3cc7d649215967e82291a9a46589af3b416c5cb,CNN,"New York (CNN) -- The most prized possessions of Bonnie and Clyde, the notorious lovebird bandits killed nearly 80 years ago, were sold for a price that the couple could only imagine getting after one of their infamous bank jobs. One of the featured items of the auction was Bonnie Parker's personal Colt .38 snub-nosed revolver, which sold for $264,000. Clyde Barrow's Colt .45 sold for $240,000. Parker's revolver was found taped to her inner thigh and Barrow's on his waistband the day they were ambushed and fatally shot by a police posse in Louisiana in 1934. Barrow and Parker were known for kidnapping, auto theft, robbery, burglary and 13 murders, including the killings of two police officers, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""These amazing and historic weapons were found on the couple the morning of their deaths and gifted to Capt. (Frank) Hamer, along with other items from that ill-fated day, on May 23, 1934. The guns, along with other items, were taken by authorities at the time as part of his compensation package for the ambush,"" said Bobby Livingston, vice president at RR Auction, in a news release. Hamer was one of the officers who killed the gangster duo. RR Auction held the sale Sunday in Nashua, New Hampshire. The pistols are a small part of the arsenal that was found in Barrow and Parker's stolen car. Livingston said the posse officers were allowed to keep firearms and other possessions from the bullet-riddled vehicle, including the Colt that Barrow may have stolen from a federal armory in Texas. A 1921 Morgan Silver Dollar, later owned by Mafia boss ""Big Paulie"" Castellano, sold for $32,400. Livingston said Castellano considered it his lucky coin, but gave it away before he was shot dead in front of Sparks Steak House in New York in 1985. Barrow's pocket watch, given to his father, Henry Barrow, after he retrieved his son's body, sold for $36,000. Other items included five original items collected off the floor of Bonnie and Clyde's car: A woman's silk stocking, an unused .45 caliber bullet and casing, a side temple from a pair of eyeglasses, a wood-handled screwdriver and an empty Bayer Aspirin tin, which sold for $11,400.

dcdba3d0d5e40cdcd2ff193c399638c8ebf7c3bb,CNN,"(CNN) -- At least 29 students died in a February 25 attack on a college in Buni Yadi, northeastern Nigeria, during which several buildings were torched. The attackers escaped the scene, but Nigeria's military suspects that the militant group Boko Haram, which has wreaked havoc in the region for several years, are the perpetrators. The Nigerian government is struggling to control the bloodshed between the mainly Muslim north and Christian south that has claimed more than 3,000 lives since Boko Haram came to prominence in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. Who are Boko Haram? Boko Haram means ""Western education is a sin."" The group's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Sharia law -- which is derived from the Koran as the ""world of God"" -- across the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, to the total destruction of the Nigerian state and its government. What's causing the unrest? Armed militant groups in Nigeria's northeastern region are nothing new, but Boko Haram has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners and bombing schools and churches. In late 2013, Human Rights Watch said Boko Haram had abducted scores of women and girls and used children as young as 13 in their campaign of violence. The country's immense oil wealth is concentrated in the south, while the predominantly Muslim north remains extremely poor. There were riots and accusations of vote-rigging when former military ruler Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, much of the north's favored candidate for president, lost to Goodluck Jonathan, who hails from the south, in the 2011 national election. What's the Nigerian government doing about it? In mid-May the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states -- Adamawawa, Yobe and Borno state -- and created the Joint Task Force wing of the military to try to stamp out the insurgency. A media blackout has also ensued, which ensures that communications in and out of the remote area are nearly impossible and that the Nigerian military can operate out of the media spotlight. The military has been accused of committing atrocities against civilians by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. After raising concerns with Nigeria's foreign minister last May, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""The government has acknowledged that there have been some problems ... they're working to try to control it."" In November 2013, Nigeria's national assembly extended the state of emergency for a further six months at the President's request. Is the violence a purely sectarian dispute? While it's easy to frame the violence as Christians versus Muslims, it's much more than sectarian. Boko Haram will attack other Muslims when they feel they're not adhering to strict Sharia law. Meanwhile, the Joint Task Force's actions in the region aren't winning them any fans -- and there are also vigilante thugs who stop and search cars entering northeastern cities like Maiduguri. Why has Boko Haram attacked mosques in the past? Boko Haram doesn't view all Muslims as supporters and allies -- and there have been suggestions that the group is attacking certain mosques because members of that mosque have assisted the Joint Task Force in tracking members of the militant group. Does Boko Haram enjoy support from the people? Although the northern populace mostly abhors the violence, there is considerable local sympathy and support for Sharia law, seen by many as the only way to put an end to what is widely regarded as a corrupt and inept government. Northern Nigeria has some of the worst human development indicators in the world -- and as the military struggles to stop the spread of attacks from Boko Haram's base in the northeast, the militant group is winning perhaps its most important battle: making Nigerians question the competency of their government. Could the violence spread to other countries? It already has. Boko Haram is active in neighboring Cameroon, where a French family was kidnapped in February 2013, as well as a French priest in November that year. And in a video released in August 2013, the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said: ""Our strength and firepower is bigger than that of Nigeria. Nigeria is no longer a big deal to us, as far as we are concerned. We will now comfortably confront the United States of America."" The U.S. says the group has links to the al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa, and extremist groups in Mali. In March 2011, Gen. Carter Ham, then the commander of U.S. Africa Command, warned Congress that Boko Haram elements ""aspire to a broader regional level of attacks,"" including against United States and European interests. Why isn't the international community stepping in? In November 2013, the U.S. State Department designated Boko Haram and its offshoot Ansaru as ""terrorist organizations,"" legally enabling Washington to take various steps against the groups, their members and their supporters. A year earlier it had designated the leader of Boko Haram as a terrorist and put a $7 million bounty on his head, in addition to providing technical and financial support to the Nigerian teams fighting on the ground. But there's a growing international reluctance to put boots on the ground unless there's a direct national security threat to the West, like in the case of the French intervention in Mali last year. Why is Nigeria so important to the region and rest of the world? What's the role of oil? Nigeria, with nearly 175 million people, is considered the political and economic powerhouse of West Africa. Rich in oil, the country is a key U.S. partner and has a massive banking sector. China is the biggest trade partner for Africa, and Nigeria is the hub of global business in the region.

4f2825b44251dba1291fa78adfe882c62ce6a8a1,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- As the country goes into the weekend with the government shut down and neither side talking, there seems to be little hope for breaking the impasse any time soon. And with the days ticking down toward the moment the country runs out of options to meet its debt obligations, the head-butting over funding the government might force Congress to try to work out a deal to get it running again and raise the debt ceiling at the same time. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King and Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley were asked about the state of play as we end a tumultuous week as well what next week might look like. Q: CNN and others reported that House Speaker John Boehner said to Republicans in private meetings that he will get something passed to avoid defaulting on the U.S. financial obligations, even if it takes putting something together that would attract Democrats. Did he blink? John King: His top aides are saying there's no dramatic shift here. But the speaker's meeting in small groups with rank-and-file lawmakers. John Boehner knows when he goes into a meeting like that it's going to leak out. What is he doing? He's sending an early signal that, ladies and gentlemen of the Republican caucus, 'we are not going to be part of defaulting.' His obituary is already going to read he was the leader of a bizarre three-ring circus on Capitol Hill. He doesn't want to say he was the speaker when the government for the first time defaulted. There's still a huge question of how you get there, though, because the speaker will continue to insist no raising the debt ceiling without getting something from the administration -- on spending cuts, on spending levels, on reforms in the most expensive government programs. And the president, of course, is on the record saying 'I won't negotiate.' You can reconcile those two positions by doing it in a couple of sequenced steps. It's an optimistic statement from the speaker that we won't default, but getting from ""A"" to the finish line is still complicated. READ MORE: House Republicans say shutdown likely to drag on . Q: Are we talking about a grand bargain again? It's hard to believe that could happen this time around -- things have gone from bad to worse in terms of relations between these two parties? King: Sometimes at the bleakest moment is when something can be pulled -- a rabbit you pull out of a hat, if you will. However, when you talk to people in both parties and top aides close to all of the people involved, from the White House to the Republicans and the Democrats on Capitol Hill, most just don't see an environment because of the distrust, because of the looming political calendar of 2014 for a big grand bargain that does Medicare, Social Security, tax reform, other entitlements, other spending cuts in the government. Is there a possibility of a smaller bargain that gets some of the things Republicans want in terms of savings in Medicare and Social Security, some other spending cuts? That is possible in these separate budget agreements. The question is can you get the government re-opened, raise the debt ceiling and then do those things? Will the Republicans trust the Democrats to do that? Or because of the suspicions, will you have the revolt? A lot of the fight has been about strategy and many people will say that's their frustration with Washington, they're more concerned about the political win rather than the ramifications and the ripple effect on the economy and the country. But the reality is it is about strategy. Q: Mitch McConnell's and Rand Paul's hot mic moment was instructive in showing the disconnect between what they are supposed to be doing and what they want to be doing. What does it mean to you to overhear this? Crowley: It certainly is a signal to the House. We had heard Rand Paul say publicly 'we're not going to be able to get rid of Obamacare.' But it's a great starting position. We have had, in particular in the Senate, a lot of Republican senators saying shutting down the government is a bad idea, it won't work for Republicans politically. This tells me that they are in a position that the Senate doesn't want to be in. It tells me that they are hearing privately and publicly from the president 'no negotiations,' which probably is more troublesome in terms of there really isn't anything going on. We kept thinking there was -- that maybe somewhere people were talking about a compromise and clearly that's not happening. So, what Republicans believe is that that particular stance -- we're not going to negotiate on anything -- is not going to survive the test of public will. So far, what we see is Republicans are taking the bulk of the blame. We'll see if that shifts. Q: Why is Boehner not bringing up this vote for a resolution? What do you believe is behind it? Is he not doing this because he's worried about losing face or his job? Why is there no vote? Crowley: I want to put something -- not particularly in this conversation -- but something we don't discuss all the time but that is there may not be the votes there. I talked to Nancy Pelosi a couple weeks ago, and I said, 'Do you like the CR? I mean, if the House put -- if Boehner -- put just a straight old temporary spending resolution, do you like it?' She said, 'No. There's too many cuts in it.' There are Democrats who don't like the CR, even plain without anything attached to it. There are Republicans that are always going to vote against it because it doesn't do anything about Obamacare, should a clean CR come up. There may not be the votes at the moment. Having said that, certainly the main impetus is that his caucus is not with him at this point. I would also suggest it's not just the 35 or 40 in the tea party caucus. They have been pretty good at holding together. This is more than 40 congressmen at this point. Now we're beginning to see some fractures and maybe a dozen House Republicans looking for a way out, but they've held force with not just the tea party, although it does seem tea party driven, obviously. Q: On the debt ceiling, what are you hearing -- on the one hand, Rep. Steve King says it's not that big a deal, that it's false demagoguery. On the other, Boehner says he won't let the country default on its obligations. Do they get that this is a big deal? Crowley: I'm hearing nobody wants to find out. The debt ceiling really has been, from economists to a number of folks on Capitol Hill, they just look at it and say, this really would be disaster on the U.S. economy, on the world economy. Even those who say, 'I don't know because I'm not an economist,' say, 'I don't want to find out.' What we're hearing from Boehner I think certainly substantiates all of that. This is not something that he's going to allow to happen, even if it means he has to rely on Democratic votes. That's something for the Republican speaker of the House to say: ""Even if I have to get Democrats to do it, we're not going to allow the debt ceiling not to go up.""",3,5.373998306908482
4b2c3e0a7765e5cb63a9197cfc6edb7985603614,CNN,"(CNN) -- AC Milan reclaimed second place in Italy's Serie A with a tempestuous 2-1 victory at Napoli on Monday night which saw the home side reduced to 10 men for half the game before a near-brawl erupted late in the match. Milan reduced Lazio's lead to two points after eight rounds thanks to a goal in each half from forwards Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, putting Massimiliano Allegri's team two clear of third-placed city rivals Inter. Napoli, who were left in sixth place, had midfielder Michele Pazienza sent off in first-half injury-time for a second handball offense but managed to reduce the deficit with 12 minutes to play with an ingenious effort from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi. Milan went into the match hoping to capitalize on defending champions Inter's 1-1 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday, and made the perfect start when Robinho opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. The Brazil star, starting in place of injured compatriot Ronaldinho, calmly sidefooted home a left-foot shot from the edge of the area following a fine cutback from substitute Massimo Oddo. Oddo, who came on for defender Luca Antonini, had found space down the right with Napoli down to 10 men as Christian Maggio received treatment for a head injury suffered in the collision that saw the Milan player leave the field 10 minutes earlier. Maggio was then replaced by Algeria international Hassan Yebda, and matters got worse for Napoli when Pazienza was sent off in the first minute of time added on. However, Lavezzi almost equalized before the halftime whistle blew with a superb header that required a flying save from Milan keeper Christian Abbiati. Abbiati was again called into action on the hour mark when he denied a fierce effort from Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik as Napoli continued to press forward, but Ibrahimovic made it 2-0 in the 71st minute with his third league goal since returning to Serie A from Barcelona. The Sweden striker bulleted in a powerful header from another Oddo cross that keeper Morgan De Sanctis could only deflect into his net. But Napoli hit back seven minutes later when Lavezzi picked himself off the floor following a goalmouth scramble to scoop a delightful flick over Abbiati and in off the crossbar. Tensions boiled over in the 83rd minute when Salvatore Aronica appeared to catch Robinho in the face with a flying arm, resulting in Kevin Prince-Boateng racing in with a rash challenge on the Napoli midfielder before confronting him. Aronica and the Ghana midfielder were both booked along with Napoli's Argentine defender Hugo Campagnaro as players piled in from both sides, including Ibrahimovic -- who appeared to be sent off after encroaching on the pitch following his earlier substitution. Napoli forced two corners in the five minutes of time added on but could not level despite De Sanctis joining in the attacks, giving Milan a morale-boosting win ahead of this weekend's clash with fifth-placed Juventus. Meanwhile, promoted Real Sociedad moved up to 11th place in Spain's La Liga after a 3-0 win at home to struggling Deportivo La Coruna on Monday night. Striker Joseba Llorente opened the scoring in the 17th minute from from Alberto de la Bella's cross, and 19-year-old French winger Antoine Griezmann made it 2-0 with 20 minutes to play with a second headed strike before a bizarre celebration which saw him jump behind the wheel of a car parked on the side of the pitch. Striker Imanol Agirretxe sealed the victory in the 86th minute after being set free by fellow substitute Jeffrey Sarpong to leave 1999-2000 Spanish champions Deportivo languishing second from bottom in the table.",7,7.863899090689077
8cc13b414a66b87d2334370e33c7bddc12905442,CNN,"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities on Thursday continued to investigate the kidnappings of at least six people from a Holiday Inn in Monterrey, Mexico, Wednesday. Nuevo Leon state Attorney General Alejandro Garza y Garza said in a news conference that the unidentified gunmen entered a second hotel as well, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. A convoy of between 10 and 15 vehicles carrying as many as 30 gunmen pulled into the Holiday Inn at around 2 a.m., Garza y Garza said. According to him, the gunmen brought a handcuffed man into the lobby, who gave them information on the intended victims. A businessman from Mexico City, Luis Miguel Gonzalez, was kidnapped, along with three other guests, Garza y Garza said. The other guests were identified as Angel Ernesto Montes de Oca of Mexico City, Manuel Juarez and Aracely Hernandez, an employee of a staffing company near the border with the United States. A hotel receptionist, David Salas, was also kidnapped, together with another hotel employee, authorities said. A security guard at the hotel was missing, but it was not confirmed that he too was kidnapped, Garza y Garza said. Before leaving, the gunmen took the computer from the reception desk as well as the video from the security camera, he said. Minutes later, there was a report of the same group of gunmen entering the Mision Hotel, located near the Holiday Inn. Police responded to the hotel, but the officials there declined to report a crime to the authorities. Northern Mexico, particularly the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, have seen a recent uptick in violent activity, much of it blamed on warring drug cartels.",1,5.48303049172613
5831e9b5e3406439d18f4eb75bda3fe9e93e7517,CNN,"(CNN) -- In 2007, at the dawn of the app market, few would have predicted the industry would soon become a billion dollar business. But thanks to the popularity of Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and other smartphone platforms, the app business is booming. Mobile phone apps are expected to generate $25 billion in worldwide sales in 2013, up 62% from last year, according to new research from Gartner Inc. The study was first reported by the Wall Street Journal Monday. The exponential growth mirrors that of smartphones -- for the first time this year, more smartphones are forecast to be shipped globally than feature phones, according to a report released Monday by IDC, the technology market research firm. IDC projects that vendors will ship 919 million smartphones this year -- 50.1% of total mobile phone shipments. ""Much of the world's smartphone shipments were a direct result of demand in mature economies such as the U.S.,"" IDC wrote. ""The balance of smartphone demand is gradually shifting, however, to emerging markets where smartphone user bases are still relatively small and economic prospects are considerably higher."" China is leading the charge in the developing world, passing the U.S. last month to become the world's top country for Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, according to Flurry Inc., a mobile analytics firm. That's helping to feed the app frenzy. Apple and Google now have more than 700,000 apps in their respective app stores. The time people spend using apps is growing, too. From December 2011 to December 2012, time spent by app users in the U.S. grew from 94 minutes to 127 minutes a day, according to Flurry. The new ""app economy"" has created about 466,000 jobs in the U.S. from 2007 to 2012, according to a study last year by TechNet. But the explosion of smartphone applications will likely decrease the odds for bedroom developers dreaming of app riches. ""You do still see the success stories but they are fewer and farther between,"" Mashable's Christine Warren told CNN. ""A lot of it has to do with luck,"" she said. ""Having a well-designed app, an app that works well with mobile so it takes advantage of the camera, it takes advantage of geolocation features, it can connect in with other apps and services -- that goes a long way. Catching the attention of the right websites and ""staying in the top 10, top 50 of the best selling list goes a long way toward long-term success,"" she said.

b14a4e1ade09381f35e0e8d781b8a927de7d917c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The blog ""Stuff White People Like"" is wildly popular with fans who've embraced the hilarious, satirical sendup of the white middle class that -- according to the list -- have an ongoing love affair with things such as coffee (No. 1), organic food (No. 6), yoga (15) and the Toyota Prius (60). Blogger-turned-author Christian Lander is the force behind ""Stuff White People Like."" The site also has spurred an outpouring from those who view it as offensive and racist. Now devotees and detractors alike have more to discuss with the release of the book ""Stuff White People Like: A Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions"" by the blog's creator, Christian Lander. Filled with photos and some content from the blog, the guide includes new entries exclusive to the book. Lander also worked with a designer to create things such as flow charts on ""How to Name a White Child"" and ""White Career Trajectories"" as well as a test of the reader's ""whiteness."" As befitting the genius behind such a site and book, Lander is a bit of a ham (actually, make that Canadian bacon since he hails from Toronto, Ontario).  Watch Lander talk about what he likes » . The origins of ""Stuff"" date from January 2008, he said, because of an instant messenger conversation between him and his friend Miles about the HBO drama ""The Wire."" Miles, who is Filipino, tossed off that he didn't trust any white person who didn't watch the series. That exchange started a back-and-forth between the two about what white people were doing instead of watching the show. ""We said, 'Oh, they are going to plays, they're doing yoga, they're getting divorced,' "" recalled Lander, who couldn't pass up the gold mine of ideas and started blogging. ""The goal was to literally make Miles and a few of my friends laugh, and it just took off."" Within six weeks, Random House came calling, and a book deal was finalized. CNN talked to the blogger-turned-author about his ""whiteness,"" whether he is like Stephen Colbert but instead mocks earnest, left-wing types, and why ""Stuff White People Like"" will never make the list of ""Stuff White People Like."" CNN: Where do you get your ideas? Christian Lander: Farmers' markets. CNN: How do you get your ideas at farmers' markets? Lander: Keeping my eyes open. I just see what people are up to. And the mirror is another good place to look for inspiration. I really make fun of myself. CNN: So what makes you an authority on white people? Lander: Look at me [laughing]. I mean, I have liberal arts degrees; I look like this. I'm on the inside. CNN: Do you ever worry about offending people? Lander: No. I'm glad when I offend people with this because it's not offensive. What's been great about it is the title draws people in, and right away they are like, ""What is this? Am I going to get offended by this?"" Then they read it, and it's not what they expect. People see the title and they expect ""Stuff White People Like"" to be entries like mayonnaise, or dancing poorly, these old stereotypes that are really outdated and aren't even funny anymore. You're sort of expecting it to be the lame white guy stuff and you go, ""Oh my God, this is all the stuff I actually like."" It's playing off white stereotypes, but it's not stereotypes in a demeaning way. CNN: If those are old stereotypes, could your stuff be considered ""new stereotypes""? Lander: No, because they're true [laughing]. I consider these valid observations. It's an update on this idea of a yuppie. In the '80s, the idea of the yuppie was really about just consumerism: I have an expensive BMW, I have these things, and it's buying, buying, buying. I think that that attitude is still there, but the materials changed into where it's ""My carbon footprint's lower, my music taste is better, I visited more countries than you."" The quest for status is still there. CNN: What are some of the entries that elicited the most negative responses and really pushed people's buttons? Lander: One was written by Miles. Now Miles is Asian, and I can't stress that enough. He wrote post No. 11, which is ""White People Like Asian Girls."" That has been by far the most commented on. The other ones have all been pretty level in terms of drawing responses from people. CNN: What are some of the things that have been rejected from the list? Lander: People send in stuff all the time, and one of the things is that people just don't get what I am going for here. They send in [suggestions such as] guns, NASCAR, trailer parks -- these old stereotypes that are not what I'm after. The one I reject a lot is people say, ""Well, you know what, 'Stuff White People Like' should be on the list of 'Stuff White People Like.' "" I'm just like, ""All right, postmodern hero, you're not the first person to send this in. I'm not putting it on the list."" CNN: Entry No. 92 is book deals, so we are assuming you like that one. What are some other things on the list you like? Lander: There are things that I like that I am ashamed that I like. My favorite entry, which I wrote and where I attack myself the most, is ""Knowing What's Best for Poor People."" That was one that definitely applies to me, and I sort of recognize the ego that's behind that one and how ridiculous that one is. CNN: What's some stuff white people don't like? Lander: Other white people. That's it. The wrong kind of white people. CNN: Who are the wrong kind of white people? Lander: Anyone you blame for everything that's wrong in America are the wrong kind of white people. Not only do they hate them because they create all of these problems, but if those kinds of people start liking anything on this list, they immediately become unacceptable. CNN: Stephen Colbert made the list, and he's renowned for making fun of the right wing. Do you consider yourself a type of Stephen Colbert for the lefties? Lander: I don't know because Stephen Colbert, in his heart of hearts, is a lefty and so am I. I consider myself a self-aware, left-wing person who's not afraid to recognize the selfishness and contradictions that come on the left. I think a lot of people who are on that side really fail to do that a lot of the time. I think the people I write about here are very, very self-righteous and believe that everything they do is right, and they are very resistant to cast a critical eye to themselves. It was really fun for me to write in a cathartic way, sort of like I am attacking my own pretentiousness and my own ridiculousness. It's just amazing because these people are so self-aware but so unaware at the same time.",7,10.253764849651931
030431bbcc1d93fd62d391d818476e8339cb67b7,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags. The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would â€” Ohio. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday . Victorious Obama faces familiar challenges . 1. The GOP has a Latino problem . ""If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. ""The big issue Republicans are going to have to wrestle with is the Hispanic issue,"" adds Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's first press secretary. ""Republicans are going to have to find a different way forward."" The national exit polls tell the story. Latinos are the fastest growing-segment of the population. Their share of the vote expanded from 9% in 2008 to 10% in this election. The president won 67% of the vote four years ago. He increased that to 71% this year. Latinos were crucial in helping Obama win the battleground states of Colorado and Nevada, and in putting the president in the lead for Florida's 29 electoral votes. And they were just as important in turning the former swing state of New Mexico into what appears to be an increasingly safe state for the Democrats. CNN Election Center: 2012 exit polls . If the current trend continues, Arizona and Texas could turn from red to purple. The 2012 election is a loud wake-up call for the GOP to change its stance on illegal immigration. And that's being acknowledged by arguably the best known Latino Republican senator. ""The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . 2. The youth vote came up big â€” and the white vote got smaller . A big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls. More of them did than last time. According to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008. They made up 19% of the electorate this time around. That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president's drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012. It wasn't just age, but also race, that worked in the president's favor. Obama's share of the white vote dropped from 43% four years ago to 39% this year. But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74% of the electorate four years ago to 72% now. And the African-American percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13%. Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74% for Romney to win. ""The youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that's to the president's credit,"" Fleischer said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . 3. The auto bailouts helped drive Obama to victory in Ohio . For months, the Obama campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler, and they were given prominent prime-time placement during the Democratic National Convention in early September. It's a strategy that the Obama campaign thought could be the difference in Ohio, a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election. ""The American auto industry is back on top,"" Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State. The bailouts were started under President George W. Bush in 2008 but Obama grabbed the keys to the program the next year, managing and funding the assistance. Romney opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. The Obama campaign and other Democrats have attacked Romney over his opposition to the federal intervention, which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies. And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China. Portman stands by Romney auto ads . It seemed to work. Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters. Economy tops voter concerns in exit polls . 4. Romney wasn't able to expand the map . Much was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney's return to the Keystone State on Election Day. The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. To a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month. There was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map. It didn't pan out. While Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it wasn't enough. And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again. Romney's 'all' proved not enough . 5. What will $6 billion get you? We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election. And we'll have a Democrat in the White House, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election. When all the bills are in, total spending for the 2012 election (all federal and state races) could top a record-breaking $6 billion. And what did all that money buy? 2012 election priciest to date: $4.2 billion tab and rising . Some would argue ... nothing.",3,5.1309387694391795
e6ac5f89f236e8db1c01f11a2af2614b24324c79,CNN,"Beijing (CNN) -- A prominent Uyghur scholar labeled a separatist by Chinese authorities may have been tried in secret and received a heavy prison sentence, his lawyer told CNN on June 18. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to Urumqi, capital of the restive far-western Xinjiang region, where a spate of recent violent incidents were blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. State media has reported that Tohti was charged with separatism. Li Fangping, his lawyer, cited anonymous sources for the news of his client's secret trial and sentencing. ""I'm shocked but don't think these are groundless rumors,"" said Li, who has not been allowed to see Tohti for months. ""Considering the tense situation in Xinjiang, I think this is very possible."" Li said local police would neither confirm nor deny the news to him. CNN's repeated phone calls Wednesday to the Xinjiang government and police went unanswered. The foreign ministry declined to comment on the case Tuesday. Vocal critic . Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Human rights groups call Tohti's possible secret trial ""disturbing."" ""Secret trials of prominent activists are very rare these days in China -- one would expect at least a show trial with the presence of his lawyer,"" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Tohti has long considered himself speaking out for Uyghurs' human rights in ways that are reasonable and acceptable to the authorities,"" she added. ""If harsh measures are being used against him, it really shows the authorities' line of tolerance has shifted a lot in the past year."" Widespread discrimination . Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said that Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government strongly denies. In the region's deadliest violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing last month killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. In March, 29 people were stabbed to death by alleged Uyghur separatists at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang. Executions . On Monday, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months, state media reported. The same day, a court in Urumqi sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October. Defendant names revealed by state media all sounded Uyghur. ""Repression plus economic incentives -- that has continued to be the government response,"" said Wang, of Human Rights Watch. ""Economic development and job opportunities are important to the Uyghurs, but these things must be done in a way that respects their culture and freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government is more interested in projecting what it wishes to do in Xinjiang rather than looking at what the real problems and ethnic grievances are in the region.""",1,7.263113835812604
81561f9d32b784764f5dff8e2eb4e83fb67ecb23,CNN,"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The International Consumer Electronics Show, the giant gadget convention that wrapped up on Friday, has brought some frustrating news for AT&T or Sprint customers who bought a cutting-edge 4G smartphone last year. That phone will soon be outdated. AT&T Mobility and Sprint Nextel unveiled some of the first smartphones that will tap into their new, even faster fourth-generation networks. But wait, Sprint has been talking about its 4G network since launching one in 2008 followed by its premier phone, HTC's Evo 4G, in 2010. And AT&T began adding ""4G"" to the names of many of its smartphones early last year. Now, two of the largest U.S. cellular carriers are ramping up yet another 4G system. They will have LTE, or Long-term Evolution, to compete with the one Verizon Wireless launched more than a year ago. T-Mobile USA says it has 4G, which is similar to AT&T's old 4G, but the carrier has not talked about plans for 4G LTE deployment. (Get all that?) Since AT&T and Sprint have already exhausted their usage of 4G in marketing, it's unclear how they will explain to customers the major investments they've made to have the latest network technology. ""I don't think the majority of our customers understand the monikers,"" AT&T executive Glenn Lurie said in an interview here at CES. Sprint product chief Fared Adib declined to comment on the company's marketing plans. Lurie, who serves as AT&T's liaison to Apple, declined to comment on why Apple refused to adopt the 4G moniker in the iPhone 4S, which uses last year's HSPA+ technology that AT&T also describes as 4G. ""Forget the G's for a second,"" Lurie said. ""What it's called doesn't matter."" Verizon has emphasized the speed enhancements offered by its version of 4G, and makes an effort to refer to the network as 4G LTE, rather than just 4G, to differentiate from competitors, David Small, the technical chief for Verizon Wireless, has told CNN. Verizon is on track to have its 4G network match the coverage of its 3G network by next year, a spokeswoman said Friday. At CES last year, Verizon hosted two large news conferences and operated a huge booth to promote the launch of its 4G network. This year, Verizon has kept a low profile. AT&T announced eight new LTE products at CES, including smartphones and tablets. The world's first LTE Windows phone, the Lumia 900, will arrive in March, Nokia wrote in a message to partners on Friday. ""We use this as a way to kick off the year,"" Lurie said. ""CES is becoming more wireless-centric than ever before."" AT&T's loss in its bid to acquire T-Mobile has not affected operations, according to Lurie. The first 4G LTE phones for AT&T hit stores in November, before the breakup with T-Mobile was announced. At many of the large CES exhibits, 4G was pervasive. For example, a station at the entrance to LG's booth displaying a row of phones was called True LTE Expert. Sprint announced three new devices at CES: a portable wireless hotspot, an LG phone made from recycled materials, and the Galaxy Nexus from Samsung and Google. Sprint's new 4G LTE network is expected to match its older, slower 4G network by the end of this year, Steve Elfman, the carrier's network operations president, said in an interview. The company will stop selling devices that support its old 4G around that same time, and it will turn off access to that network in 2015. ""The ecosystem is going to be larger in LTE,"" Elfman said. Not only will it be larger, but this 4G is likely to remain king for some time.",6,7.5423647377298355
320bf7b0f61cad88ab3dfb41b2d45490dadfc18f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Daniel Libeskind, the Polish-American architect responsible for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment, says his favorite building is the Military History Museum in Dresden, Germany. Originally an armory for Kaiser Wilhelm I and subsequently under Nazi and Soviet control, the Bundeswehr's main military museum survived the 1945 bombing of Dresden due to its location on the city's outskirts. ""It is an interesting project for me,"" says Libeskind, ""because now it is a museum of modern democratic Germany. How to transform it? How to create a new sense of what it means to have a military in a democracy which is controlled by the citizens?"" In Libeskind's $85 million redesign, completed in 2011, a huge wedge of concrete and steel scythes through the stone, columned building, to create something he describes as ""both disruptive of the old, but [that] also gives you a sense of how we have changed our thinking."" Watch Great Buildings on CNN's Connect the World . Born in Poland, raised under Communist regimes and the child of Holocaust survivors, Libeskind says the concept underpinning his design ""wasn't something that I had to research in libraries."" The dramatic shard, which was constructed as the building was also being restored, helps to reorient the museum's purpose. Libeskind says the new space offers visitors a chance to question ""why people participate in and organize violence, why they conform to totalitarian thoughts."" View a hi-res gallery of Libekind's 'Great Buildings' ""This space is not for weapons. It's to navigate between the horizontal world of history and the vertical world of human aspiration and understanding."" ""I wanted people to feel that sense of displacement, that space of catastrophe,"" he says. ""It's not just about weapons and rockets and tanks, it's about people's decisions, and how people view the world."" The building Libeskind most wishes he'd designed is one completely at odds with its surrounds -- the Eiffel Tower, which looms over Paris' uniformly mid-rise cityscape. ""It's a building with no function, that has no program,"" Libeskind says. ""It's completely uncharacteristic of Paris, and yet it's such a fantastic building. Today it's one of the world's most recognizable and most-visited monuments but in its day, the tower, erected for the 1889 World's Fair, was a controversial emblem of industrialization. Libeskind admires the daring of its design, which was innovative for its time, and the risks its engineers took -- ""the technology had never really been used. There is no guarantee how it would work,"" he notes -- but he also admires its poetry. ""It doesn't mimic anything. It's original. It has a spirit to it, a spirit of the unknown. And when you go see it, you still wonder, what the hell is this thing? How was it built?"" ""That defines for me what good architecture is: It's not a formula. It's not the pretty facade of the building. It's how the building transforms the city. It's changed how people view Paris."" ""All the great artists, composers and politicians hated that building. They wanted to tear it down. They thought it was the ugliest, stupidest thing. But, in the long run, it became the most beloved and most symbolic building of France, of Paris, of Europe."" Libeskind's Dresden museum was also criticized but, he says, he never doubted it. ""Once you hit on the right idea, it's not a matter of compromising. Of course, you have to be flexible to work it out, but the big idea has to be so strong, it has to go through fire and still emerge exactly how you wanted it to be."" ""If people enjoy it, the building becomes part of the city, and then people have a different idea of the city. It can have a big role in changing what the world looks like to us.""",7,9.857438439087767
c8b5c1b356257c058255786a56f4d086a6446572,CNN,"(CNN) -- An estranged son of anti-gay Kansas pastor Fred Phelps said Wednesday that the spiritual leader of Westboro Baptist Church hit his wife and beat his children with a mattock handle until they bled. ""I think what he does out there is evil,"" said Nathan ""Nate"" Phelps, during an appearance on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" Nate Phelps is the seventh of the Westboro Baptist minister's 13 children. The younger Phelps severed ties with his family on his 18th birthday and said he hasn't had contact with his father in three decades. Nate Phelps is currently writing a book about his family. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Westboro's practice of picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers with offensive placards is constitutionally protected free speech. The picketing, which includes chants and placards stating ""God Hates Fags"" and ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" have enraged supporters of the U.S. military and the families and friends of slain soldiers. Nate Phelps called his pastor father ""one of the best reasons that America has been forced to get off the fence and address this issue (of gay rights)."" ""But at the same time you can't ignore the fact that he's done a lot of damage,"" Phelps said. ""He's hurt a lot of families, not only in the gay community, but the families of these soldiers."" The younger Phelps said his father also hurt his own family. ""He used his fists. He used his knees and he used ... the handle of a mattock,"" said Phelps, referring to a pick-like digging tool. ""He used that in such a way that it split the skin on the back of the kid's legs so they bled."" ""If they want to call that discipline, that's fine. But I call it abuse,"" Phelps said. The son said Fred Phelps also hit his mother, but not with the handle of the mattock. Phelps has also said his father abused prescription drugs when he was in law school. He didn't back down from the claim during the HLN interview. Velez-Mitchell read a statement from Nate Phelps' sister, Shirley Phelps-Roper, denying the claim. ""Yikes. Hell no. His (Nate Phelps') imagination goes on and on,"" Roper wrote.  ""This lie should not have come out of his mouth when he decided to reject the word of God. Nothing he can say will change the fact that God hates (homosexuals) and their enablers and therefore God hates America and America is doomed."" Nate Phelps responded that his sister ""just cynically lies about what happened."" Likewise, Phelps said his father manipulates facts and circumstances to reach false conclusions. ""My father can make any connection to anything that anyone has done or hasn't done in their life and point to that to say that  that's evidence they're damned and going to hell,"" Phelps said. ""He's convinced that homosexuality is the ultimate sin against God. ""So since the United States is taking steps to move in the direction of equality for gays in America, he says that has doomed America,"" Phelps said. ""So anyone who is connected to America, so anyone who is supporting America in any sense is subject to the wrath of God."" When asked what he would say to his father if he could, Nate Phelps replied, ""I've never had a relationship with my father. I wouldn't know what to say to him."" There was no immediate public response from Fred Phelps to his son's televised remarks.",1,8.73234249102731
110a6f03f95dc0a859c9dcb14168af862bb9efc3,CNN,"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Steven Hayes, convicted of killing three members of a Connecticut family, has shown ""suicidal tendencies"" and expressed concern his food was tainted, a psychiatrist testified during the penalty phase of Hayes' trial Monday. Dr. Justin Schechter, a Stamford, Connecticut, forensic and clinical psychiatrist, said that Hayes exhibited signs of depression after his 2007 arrest, but told him, ""I would rather they kill me"" -- reflecting Hayes' apparent hope that he'd be executed for his role in in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. The jury must decide whether to sentence Hayes to death. Hayes wasn't in solitary confinement or considered ""actively suicidal,"" said Schechter, though there were concerns he had a seizure disorder, depression and anxiety. The high school dropout said he had a long history of substance abuse and had fathered two children out of wedlock, Schechter said. Hayes believed that a doctor was ""manipulating"" his food and wouldn't eat it, said Schechter, though he did eat food from the prison commissary. The court session ended with Schechter's testimony on Monday afternoon, and will resume Tuesday. Hayes, 47, was convicted this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of Hawke-Petit and her daughters. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, beat Jennifer Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee. Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately. Earlier in the day, Fred Levesque, former director of offender classification and population management for the state Department of Correction, testified that Hayes was written up for 24 disciplinary reports during a stretch in state prison. One of those was for hoarding medication, a charge to which Hayes voluntarily pleaded guilty. Asked by the defense if he had any knowledge of whether Hayes was a threat to the general population, Levesque answered ""no."" Last week, a forensic psychiatrist testified that Hayes attempted suicide several times since his arrest and has said he wants to receive the death penalty. On cross-examination, Dr. Paul Amble said his panel did not address the question of whether Hayes' suicide attempts were sincere. But in his opinion, he said, Hayes was ""making decisions that were rational, given his situation"" when he said he wanted to receive the death penalty. ""I want to plead guilty to everything now, because I just want it over now,"" Hayes told an evaluation team, said Amble, the assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. Hayes described a plan to ""look like a monster"" to the jury, expressing no remorse, in an attempt to move the jurors to sentence him to death, Amble wrote in his evaluation of the defendant. Prosecutor Michael Dearington asked Amble whether Hayes truly wanted to be executed. ""I don't know,"" the doctor said. ""I'm not here to say I can exactly divine his thoughts, only what he said."" In March, Hayes told a psychologist that he no longer wanted to commit suicide ""but intended to let the state do it,"" said Amble, who had been asked by the judge in the case to determine whether Hayes was competent to stand trial. Police testified that in the 2007 home invasion, Hayes and Komisarjevsky found evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000 and forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account. Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, officials said, the two men set the home afire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. CNN'S Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.",1,7.378762618984083
ad3261c863d09dd73c83bc1545700dcafeea5085,CNN,"(CNN) -- Basketball commentator and former hoops star Charles Barkley was arrested Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of drunken driving, a police spokesman said. Charles Barkley was driving an Infiniti SUV through a trendy area of Scottsdale on Wednesday, police say. Barkley issued a brief statement, saying, ""I am disappointed that I put myself in that situation. The Scottsdale police were fantastic. I will not comment any further as it is a legal matter."" Lt. Eric Shuhandler of the Gilbert Police Department said an officer pulled Barkley over after he ran a stop sign in Scottsdale's Old Town area, a trendy spot known for its nightclubs and bars. Gilbert and Scottsdale are in the Phoenix metro area. ""The officer identified the driver of the 2005 Infiniti as Charles Barkley,"" according to a written statement from police. ""Mr. Barkley was administered the standard field sobriety tests after the odor of intoxicating liquor was detected.""  Watch: Barkley 'disappointed' by arrest » . At a news conference later in the day, Shuhandler said Barkley's ""performance on the field sobriety test revealed there was probable cause to make an arrest."" Barkley declined to take a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said earlier. ""When he arrived at the station, police administered a blood test, which is customary of our police department to do,"" he said, adding that Barkley consented to the blood test. It will take ""a few days"" for the crime lab to test the blood sample and determine Barkley's blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said. The former NBA power forward was cited for driving while impaired and released. ""It was a pretty routine arrest,"" Shuhandler said. Barkley's sport-utility vehicle was impounded under mandatory vehicle impound laws, police said. Shuhandler said Barkley behaved professionally during the booking and was ""very respectful and cordial with our officers.""  Watch Shuhandler describe the arrest » . Barkley, 45, is a commentator for TNT's coverage of the NBA. In October, he told CNN's Campbell Brown that he plans to run for governor of his home state of Alabama in 2014, saying, ""I can't screw up Alabama. We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi aren't going anywhere."" Although he is well known for entertaining comments and a cocky attitude, he also compiled an impressive résumé as a professional basketball player. A Hall of Famer and 11-time All-Star, Barkley is one of four players in history to rack up more than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in a career. He also earned the NBA's most valuable player designation in 1993 and brought home gold medals with the U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1992 and 1996. His commanding performance on the court earned him the nicknames ""Sir Charles"" and the ""Round Mound of Rebound."" Barkley was drafted out of Auburn University in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers and played 16 seasons with the Sixers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before he was permanently sidelined in 1999 with a ruptured tendon in his left knee.

6564e103281893b1ea039c01d2f9332edface656,CNN,"QINGDAO, China (CNN) -- Another round of toasts and exclamations of ""hajiu"" sounded out around me. I took a sip and set down my small glass of Tsingtao beer as my new friends downed theirs and refilled. Our seafood dinner, perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop, was punctuated regularly by such moments. A worker operates the giant fermentation units at the Qingdao Brewery plant in Qingdao. I joined in happily, although somewhat bemused, at each increasingly beery celebration of our host, the worldly Captain Jau. My company, a gathering from four regions of China, was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette, in the city of Qingdao. A few drinks in the People's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city. You'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao (pronounced Chingdao) is. The Chinese city in Shandong province doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing, Shanghai, or even Xi'an. The 2008 Olympics gave it a place on the map as China's sailing hub; no longer a secret that holiday-making officials could keep for themselves. But my American spell-check doesn't recognize it (which says more about my spell-check), and you can still find pre-Cultural Revolution manhole covers. So what is it about this city that seduces the unassuming traveler? Nestled on the coast of Shandong province, almost exactly halfway between its big sisters, Beijing and Shanghai, Qingdao features as a handy pit-stop on East coast itineraries. It boasts great infrastructure, a charming climate, alfresco eateries, good coffee, sandy beaches, German history, international hotels, a brand new airport and even a famous brewery. Qingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it weren't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English, and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches, stoically named Number One to Number Six. ""In mainland China, Qingdao's history is uniquely international; in fact, more of the city's cultural identity is wrapped up in its German colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of Daoism"" said Eric Blocher, editor of the English-language magazine Red Star. ""The local culture bureau once joked to us that Qingdao is a 'cultural desert', because it doesn't have the dynastic lineage of Nanjing or Xi'an, or opera for that matter,"" Blocher said. ""But that's not what makes a city livable, or even fun -- if your office is in downtown, you're never more than five minutes from a protected beach; there's always excellent seafood close at hand; you can buy China's best beer fresh, for 10 cents a pound, and walk around drinking it out of a plastic bag."" Following this key advice, I visited Qingdao during the International Beer Festival in late August, an event aimed largely at a domestic Chinese market. The West knows beer. China does not. The annual Beer Festival aims to change this. While the bright lights and myriad beers flowed, one thing was obvious: this was for the tourists. True Qingdaonese people are fiercely proud of Tsingtao beer, produced just down the road on Beer Street, and little else is drunk here in homes or bars. Pijiu, beer in Mandarin, is hajiu in Qingdaonese, the regional dialect. When in doubt, this does as well for a toast as anything else. Indeed, there is no better way of celebrating an occasion than by toasting the guest of honor with a bag of fresh beer. If I was the guest of honor at Captain Jau's table, I certainly wasn't living up to expectations. Particularly not for my self-appointed etiquette guardian and ""pure Qingdao boy,"" Loukas. As I raised my glass for a sip and Loukas jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time, it all became clear. In Qingdao, a beer glass is never raised without a toast. This serves three (frankly ingenious) purposes; beer is drunk in unison; beer isn't consumed too rapidly, since constant toasting would ruin conversation; and everyone finds ways to honor each other for the purposes of toasting. Captain Jau was particularly in favor of the latter as our eccentric host was made subject of most cheers, likewise teaching us the salutations he had learned from the many foreign guests he had cooked for. From the French ""salut!"" to the German ""prost!"" to the Turkish ""serefe!"" Most popular of all was homegrown ""hajiu!"" Alcohol is enjoyed throughout China. Microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in Japan and Singapore. For now Tsingtao holds the monopoly, and Qingdao's people aren't complaining. The Tsingtao Brewery, founded in 1903 by German settlers, confiscated by the Japanese in 1915, turned over to state ownership in 1949 and finally privatized in the early 1990s, has witnessed a colorful history. The largest stakeholder, Anheuser-Busch, recently sold majority ownership to Japanese Asahi Breweries. Residents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export. Outside every shop is a barrel or two of Tsingtao, with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer. Tsingtao beer tastes crisp and sweet (most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley. It is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation. A pint, when sold in this method, costs around 1.5 renminbi, or 22 U.S. cents. Beer is a way of life here and has been ever since the Germans arrived and erected tree-lined avenues, red-roofed houses and a brewery. The Germans are gone but the beer stayed. And with it, three hajiu-loving generations tell you about their happy memories. ""When I was little, buying beer was one special job I did for my dad every summer day,"" explained Irene Cheung over a fresh bag of beer. ""I was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home."" It is easier to identify Qingdao by what it is not -- smoggy, crowded Beijing, or nightlife hub Shanghai -- than what it is or hopes to be. This may be the very reason why Qingdao remains largely unvisited by the West. And while there may not be much more than good weather, food and beer to keep you content, that may just be enough to hop on the three-hour flight from Hong Kong, or the one hour 20 minute-journey from Beijing or Shanghai. Following Olympic-based investment, more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs. You can source anything from shoes to jewels to Durex condoms among the largely Korean-owned industries. If these things aren't up your street, head elsewhere; like functionally named Beer Street, Bar Street, or my personal favorite, Coffee and Tea Craft Street. ""We used to have to put on parties so that there would be material to justify an English-oriented lifestyle magazine,"" editor Blocher said. ""Now we have trouble keeping track!""

263fc172b766e8af8759756e7c1c1c3a788b67a8,CNN,"(CNN) -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics, died Tuesday, the Special Olympics said. She was 88. Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006. Born on July 10, 1921, in Brookline, Massachusetts, Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics, which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962. Today, 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations, according to the Special Olympics. ""She was the light of our lives, a mother, wife, grandmother, sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others,"" the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement. ""For each of us, she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games, to visit us in our homes, to attend to her own mother, her sisters and brothers, and to sail, tell stories, and laugh and serve her friends."" No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements, a source close to the family said. Shriver's husband, R. Sargent Shriver, and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died, the Special Olympics said in a statement.  Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver's life » . ""We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder,"" Brady Lum, Special Olympics president and chief operating officer, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement. It is an enormous loss, but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family, friends, and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed."" Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968, Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector. She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets. In September 1962, Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister, Rosemary, which was published in The Saturday Evening Post. At an event honoring her in 2007, Shriver spoke of her life: ""Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities. ""As important as it has been, it is not the whole story of my life. My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities. It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children. ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband.""  Watch Shriver reflect on her life » . At the same event, Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister, saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents, including compassion. ""She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind. She picked this up, obviously, at a very early age. All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary."" After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945, helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life. From 1947 to 1948, she worked for $1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency.  See highlights of Shriver's public and private life » . In the early 1950s, she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago, Illinois. She married Sargent Shriver Jr., a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant, in 1953. The couple's five children include California's first lady, Maria Shriver. Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s, including Head Start and the Peace Corps. He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics. He ran President Johnson's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970. He was Democrat George McGovern's running mate in the 1972 presidential election. In 1957, Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, which was established in 1946 to honor the family's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people.  Watch Shriver receive a special honor » . Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy. In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children, adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008. Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s, Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp, called Camp Shriver, on her farm in Maryland. Her vision expanded over the years, and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago. She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States, including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971. In 1981, Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers. That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006. Along the way, Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame's Founder's Award and nine honorary degrees. In 1995, the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait. The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin. In 2009, a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery.  See images from Shriver's life » . Her health began to fail in recent years, landing her in the hospital in 2005 after a minor stroke and hip fracture. She was hospitalized again in 2007 for an undisclosed ailment.

In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted ""God is great"" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. ""Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,"" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. ""They will be like wounded animals."" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects. E-mail to a friend .",1,8.02564510183028
86e79dc3662e5eb53cd567e8c42251eb73a495bf,CNN,"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli navy took control of a boat that violated an Israeli blockade and crossed into Gazan waters Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said, while a Gaza group said the ship was carrying humanitarian aid, a former U.S. congresswoman and a Nobel laureate. Cynthia McKinney reportedly is asking the international community to demand the crew's release. The boat's crew included former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, according to the Free Gaza Movement, a human rights group that sent the boat it calls ""Spirit of Humanity"" from Cyprus. Along with McKinney, who served six terms in the House of Representatives from Georgia and was the Green Party's presidential nominee in 2008, Israeli authorities took 20 people into custody, the group said. Also aboard, the group said, was Mairead Maguire, who co-founded a group that worked for peace in Northern Ireland. Maguire and co-founder Betty Williams received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for their work. IDF said the Israeli navy contacted the boat, which it called the Arion, while it was still at sea and warned the crew they would not be allowed to enter Gazan waters ""because of security risks in the area and the existing naval blockade."" Disregarding all warnings, the boat entered Gazan coastal waters, IDF said. An Israeli navy force intercepted, boarded and took control of the boat, directing it toward Ashdod, Israel, IDF said. The boat's crew, the military said, would ""be handed over to the proper authorities."" Without naming individuals on the boat, IDF confirmed the incident it described was the same one detailed by the Free Gaza Movement. According to the Free Gaza group, McKinney said, ""This is an outrageous violation of international law against us. Our boat was not in Israeli waters, and we were on a human rights mission to the Gaza Strip,"" before authorities confiscated cell phones. ""President Obama just told Israel to let in humanitarian and reconstruction supplies, and that's exactly what we tried to do. We're asking the international community to demand our release so we can resume our journey,"" McKinney said, according to the group. McKinney's father, former Georgia state legislator Billy McKinney of Atlanta, said he received a call from his daughter about 3 a.m. Tuesday. She told him ""I'm OK. I'm OK,"" then hung up as Israeli military began to board the ship, Billy McKinney said. He added that the U.S. State Department gave his family a contact with the U.S. Embassy in Israel but by Tuesday night the family had not heard anything back from the embassy. IDF said the aid aboard the boat would be delivered to Gaza ""subject to authorization."" ""Any organization or country that wishes to transfer humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip can legally do so via the established crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip with prior coordination,"" IDF said. Free Gaza said the Spirit of Humanity voyage is the eighth such trip the group has launched. Five succeeded, the group said, but the Israeli military stopped attempts in January and December 2008.",3,9.64140338768287

Virtually unknown in Europe and the U.S., Rahman has sold 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- and is worshipped throughout much of Asia, where he's known as the Mozart of Madras. Now he has added a Hollywood film score to his vast repertoire of movie music. Rahman explained to CNN what he thinks makes great movie music. ""A great soundtrack is like 'Laura""s theme', the 'Love Story' theme, 'Chariots of Fire' and all those sorts of things, where it stood by itself,"" he said. But recently, he's noticed a changing mood. ""Now it is becoming too abstract and more ambient and more... I don't know, soundscape-ish, more than melody. People are afraid of melody: 'Oh, that melody is distracting my scene,' it is becoming like that."" And that brings fresh challenges for the makers of film music. ""Now the challenges of the composer are much more,"" he told CNN. ""One needs to know of recording, production, it is not enough to compose a great theme and [know] how it can intertwine with the movie. And with Indian film it is an even greater challenge, because we need to be like Michael Jackson, John Williams, Hans Zimmer and an Indian folk composer all put together. So they expect finesse and they expect versatility."" Rahman's compositions are versatile enough to be used by both Bollywood and Hollywood, a case in point being his music for the Hindi film ""Dil Se,"" which was used almost a decade later by Spike Lee for ""Inside Man."" But for Rahman, the process to create film music is being challenged by increasingly crammed movie schedules. ""There used to be a time where the director and the composer would work together,"" he explained. ""They would develop themes and the director would shoot a scene, but now the world's so fast that people are finishing the movie even before going to a composer."" As well as writing songs and scores, Rahman has featured in many Bollywood films singing the songs which are mimed by the acting superstars. He recently completed a sell-out tour of the U.S. performing highlights from his songbook to devoted fans. He explained to CNN how playback singing is a normal part of Indian film music. ""Well, until I worked in 'Bombay Dreams' six or seven years back, I never realized that it is not cool to have playback singing. Until then, it was the story of Indian films where somebody else lip synchs and somebody else sings."" And Rahman has been converted to the Western model, where those singing on-screen usually provide the vocals themselves. ""In my future projects I would rather have a star who sings,"" he said. Director Shekhar Kapur recruited Rahman and fellow composer Craig Armstrong to provide the score for Cate Blanchett's sequel to ""Elizabeth,"" ""The Golden Age,"" which premieres at Toronto Film Festival in September this year. Kapur described the thrill of working with two such different -- and complementary -- composers. He told CNN, ""Here are two totally different cultures. Craig Armstrong is strings and heart, the skies, choir, angels and devils, and A. r. is modern, restless music."" ""Just to get them together was very interesting for me. To sit there and see both of them jamming together, that was fascinating. They wouldn't talk, they would jam, and out of the jamming came the music. It was great."" Rahman is still getting used to his new-found status as darling of both East and West -- and it leads to a somewhat chaotic lifestyle, as he explained. ""It is terrifying sometimes. I suddenly wake up in Scotland doing music for 'Golden Age,' and suddenly wake up doing an Indian superstar film, but I think after all these years I am probably getting a balance.""

7d9d8b108cbb1c96d8b1085e13e8478bfd22ba11,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama tore into the Republican opposition on Capitol Hill Wednesday, blaming the GOP for what he called politically motivated opposition on virtually every issue. Democrats have been willing to incorporate Republican ideas on health care and other issues, he said, but Republicans have not been willing to do the same. Addressing a gathering of Senate Democrats, Obama promised to ""call (Republicans) out when (Democrats) extend a hand and get a fist in return."" Several Democrats facing tough election fights this November were given time to ask the president questions on high-profile issues such as trade and deficit reduction. Much of the president's time, however, was used to lash out at GOP tactics. Senate Republicans, he said, have tried to employ the filibuster more over the past year than in all of the 1950s and 1960s combined. The GOP's strategy has been ""20 years of obstruction packed into one,"" he said. ""If you want to govern, you can't just say no,"" he argued. ""It can't be about just scoring points."" The filibuster, he added, only works as intended if there is a ""genuine spirit of compromise."" The president's tough rhetoric was part of a more aggressive -- and frequently populist -- White House strategy in the wake of the Democrats' recent upset loss in the Massachusetts Senate race. GOP Sen.-elect Scott Brown's victory stripped Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority and raised fears among many congressional Democrats about a potential GOP landslide in the upcoming midterm elections. The Democratic answer to the Massachusetts Senate race should not be ""to do nothing"" in Congress, he said. Nervous constituents want to see legislative progress, he asserted. ""We should do more, and we should do so without delay,"" he said. In recent days -- during a meeting with House Republicans in Maryland and in town hall forums in Florida and New Hampshire -- Obama has repeatedly offered to work with GOP leaders. At the same time, he has been ratcheting up his own partisan rhetoric. ""By extending an olive branch to Republicans, the president appears to be attempting to appeal to independent voters who have flocked to the GOP over the past several months,"" CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser said. ""But the president also needs to rally a deflated and angry Democratic base, which accounts in part for his tougher attacks against GOP leaders."" Obama cited several examples of what he said was GOP legislative maneuvering motivated purely by political considerations. Among other things, he raised the recent example of seven GOP senators who backed a bill establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission, but then turned against it when the proposal came to a vote. He also noted that a large number of bills have been subjected to Republican-led filibusters, only to receive 85 or 90 votes once the filibuster is broken and the legislation is allowed to move to a final vote. I'm ""not open to switches"" solely ""because it's good short-term politics,"" he said. I won't tolerate an ""if you lose, I win"" mentality. Obama urged Senate Democrats to stop listening to what he called politically oriented cable television shows on networks such as Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, and instead get out of the Washington ""echo chamber."" Most people ""don't care about majorities and minorities and process,"" he said. They just want to know if their elected representatives are ""delivering for me."" The president warned fellow Democrats that the public is often misinformed on key issues such as budget deficits. Many constituents will cite foreign aid or legislative earmarks when discussing ways to reduce spending, he said, when in reality those items constitute a minuscule share of federal spending. Balancing the budget while refusing to raise taxes and exempting entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare would require 60 percent cuts in virtually every other program, and ""that's just not going to happen,"" he said. Noting that Bill Clinton left office with budget surpluses, Obama asserted that Democrats ""should have credibility"" on the deficit issue. But the party is ""still haunted"" by debates from the 1960s and '70s when the party was stuck with the ""tax and spend"" label, he said.

d3f6c732c7c83a7134a6ef2065b1d8d78faa6491,CNN,"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek police have arrested the captain of a U.S. ship whose passengers and crew had hoped to help lead a Gaza-bound flotilla aimed at challenging Israel's maritime blockade of the Palestinian territory. John Klusmire, an American citizen and captain of The Audacity of Hope, was asked to report to a police station Saturday morning, said Jane Hirschmann, an American who is one of the flotilla organizers. A spokesperson with the Greek Coast Guard, who was not named per custom, confirmed Klusmire's arrest. The reason given was that he had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Hirschmann added that, in addition to disobeying a police order, Klusmire is being charged with disturbing sea traffic. ""This is intimidation,"" she said. ""They're making an example of our captain to stop other boats in the flotilla from trying to sail."" His vessel -- which carried 36 American passengers, four crew members and several journalists, including CNN reporter Phil Black -- was intercepted Friday by a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed Perama. The Greek authorities were in a standoff with the crew for about three hours, during which activists sang, chanted and waved signs in support of their mission. The ordeal took a turn, however, when an inflatable boat carrying an armed Greek military commando team told the activists to follow them back to port or face being boarded. Eventually, the ship returned to Greece, where it is now tied up at a Greek naval facility. Four other crew members have been ordered by Greek authorities to stay aboard the ship, Hirschmann said. Many other activist passengers have remained on the vessel as well, in a show of solidarity. The Audacity of Hope is one of 10 ships that organizers hope to unite to form a flotilla heading toward the Middle East. The trip is partially meant to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in subsequent clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. The Greek government said Friday that it won't allow any of the nine other boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous. Flotilla members accuse the Greek government of buckling to pressure from Israel's government. For their part, the Israelis have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all. On Tuesday, the Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. They alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations as ludicrous, saying: ""They see this nonviolent, rag-tag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic."" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- on Saturday issued a joint statement asking ""all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation."" The Quartet added in its statement that it ""strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings."" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's ""legitimate security concerns.""

7d2ce0a6e28b07f6a6da2dcce7328ad63daaee39,CNN,"(CNN) -- The scenes are depressingly familiar. A gunman opens fire on an American campus. Students, teachers and administrators duck for cover. Parents anxiously wait for their kids to check in, praying for the phone to ring. It played out again Tuesday at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon, a city of 16,400 people 12 miles east of Portland. Jared Padgett, a student at the school, shot and killed another student before taking his own life. The 15-year-old Padgett arrived at school on a bus, carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag, Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson told reporters Wednesday. The freshman student had an AR-15 type rifle, a semi-automatic handgun, nine loaded magazines capable of holding several hundred rounds, and a large knife, Anderson said. Authorities have found no link between Padgett and his victim, 14-year-old freshman, Emilio Hoffman, and no known motive. Padgett shot and killed Hoffman in a locker room. He also shot and wounded a teacher. Padgett then moved through a main hallway, where he ducked into a small restroom as officers closed in, Anderson said. There was a brief exchange of gunfire, but, based on autopsy reports, Padgett died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""Given the weapons and the amount of ammunition that the shooter was carrying, the early notification and the initial law enforcement response were critical,"" the police chief said. The school shooting, the second in a week, is the latest in a long string. An attack at Seattle Pacific University last week killed one person and wounded two others. Timeline of U.S. school violence . Speaking in Washington, President Barack Obama said the nation should be ashamed of its inability to get tougher gun restrictions through Congress in the aftermath of mass shootings that he said have become commonplace in America. ""Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There's no advanced, developed country on Earth that would put up with this,"" he said. Heroics by coach . Todd Rispler, a teacher and coach at the school, was praised by police for what they called heroic actions. Witnesses at the school said that after the shooter killed Hoffman, he chased Rispler out of the building while shooting at him. Several students said they saw blood on Rispler's white shirt as he ran. What they didn't see was that the coach ran to the main administrative office, where he alerted the school's leadership about the gunman on the premises. Officials immediately initiated a lockdown on the school. ""Despite being injured, (he) was able to make his way to the office and initiate the school lockdown procedure,"" Anderson said. The news was warmly received by students at the school, who made a celebrity of Rispler by posting about him on social media. ""Everyone on Twitter is talking about how he's a boss and how even if he was shot and injured he'd be fine,"" student Kara Ikebe told CNN. A closer look: How many school shootings since Newtown? The debate . So, what now? Will this latest instance of gun violence compel Congress to act? The President isn't optimistic. Most members of Congress are ""terrified"" of the National Rifle Association, he said Tuesday, adding that nothing will change until public opinion demands it. ""The country has to do some soul-searching about this. This is becoming the norm, and we take it for granted, in ways that, as a parent, are terrifying to me,"" Obama said. There was no immediate response from the NRA. The number of active shooter events -- defined as one or more people whose primary motive is mass murder in a confined or populated area, not including gang and family-related shootings -- has risen somewhat in real numbers in recent years. A report by the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center found that the number of these types of mass shootings has increased from an average of about five a year prior to 2009 to 15 in 2013. Opinion: Gun debate? What gun debate? The focus . The NRA and its supporters have previously said that no number of laws can effectively stop anyone out to kill. ""The violence is in the person, not in the gun,"" Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.Org, said this year. ""And until you figure out how to treat the violence, then you're going to have that. And taking all the guns off the street is not going to make anybody any safer."" CNN analyst Fareed Zakaria disagrees. ""Every time there is a serious gun massacre in the United States -- and alas, these are fairly common -- the media focuses on the twisted psychology of the shooter and asks why we don't pay more attention to detecting and treating mental illness,"" he wrote. ""The question we should really be focused on is not the specific cause of a single shooting, but why there are so many of them in America."" America's per capita gun homicide rate in 2009 was 12 times higher than the average of Canada, Germany, Australia and Spain. ""Does anyone think that we have 12 times as many psychologically troubled people as they do in these countries?"" It's a point Obama also touched on Tuesday. ""The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis,"" he said. Oregon school shooting victim 'didn't deserve what he got' The aftermath . Back at Reynolds High School on Tuesday, anxious parents waited for news that their children were safe as word of the shooting spread. Evacuated students were bused to a local grocery store parking lot and released after clearing a police pat-down for weapons. One couple, Craig Tuholski and Tawnjia Reimer, were talking with CNN affiliate KGW about how agonizing the wait for news was, when Tuholski's cell phone rang. ""Is that Chris?"" Reimer asked before letting out a sigh of relief. ""Oh, thank God."" ""That's what we were waiting for,"" Tuholski said after hanging up. The vigil . Several hundred people turned out Tuesday night for a vigil to honor Hoffman, including his family. Although senior Jaylen Edwards didn't know Emilio Hoffman well, he posted one of the early tweets calling the community to attend. ""At the end of the day, we can come together for a great cause and support Emilio and his family,"" he told affiliate KATU. As candles flickered in the fading light, the heartbroken community sang ""Amazing Grace."" ""We just have to make sure that we all stick together and have each other's backs,"" Edwards said.

635ca718234ab006e562ad0ed44e688d5cd6b089,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Unified School District board on Tuesday fired Miramonte Elementary School teacher Martin Bernard Springer just hours after he was formally charged with three felony counts of lewd acts upon a girl under age 14, a school spokesman said. Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, has 30 days to appeal his firing, school spokesman Tom Waldman said. Springer pleaded not guilty late Tuesday afternoon in a Los Angeles County court to three felony counts of lewd acts on a child over three months in 2009. The judge set his bail at $300,000 on the condition that Springer stay more than 250 feet away from witnesses and alleged victims, stay more than 100 feet away from any school or facility with children and be with an adult supervisor when he's around children. Springer's preliminary hearing is scheduled for February 16. Springer was the second teacher at Miramonte charged with lewd conduct with pupils. Last week, former Miramonte teacher Mark Berndt, 61, was arrested and accused of taking bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom, including some with suspected semen-filled spoons at their mouths. The school board fired Berndt a year ago; Berndt appealed but he dropped the appeal and resigned last spring, Waldman said. On Tuesday, the school board also fired a third teacher, music teacher Vance Miller at Hamilton High School, in the wake of unrelated allegations of sexual misconduct with students, Waldman said. Miller could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. The school board unanimously approved the two latest firings during a closed session and announced its decisions publicly afterward, Waldman said. The three counts against Springer involve one girl who was identified only as ""Jane Doe"" and ""under the age of 14 years."" The complaint alleged the crimes occurred in April, May and June of 2009, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. If convicted, Springer would face a maximum state prison term of 12 years, prosecutors said. Springer was arrested Friday and accused of fondling two girls in the classroom, but Tuesday's charges involve only one alleged victim. Berndt, who taught for 30 years, is being held in lieu of $23 million bail: $1 million for each of the 23 counts he faces of lewd acts on a child. When asked about the difference between Springer's $300,000 bail and Berndt's $23 million bail, spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said the charges against Berndt are more serious, involving bondage, for example. Meanwhile, students at Miramonte Elementary School will return to class later this week to a new staff, because administrators do not want any more ""surprises"" at the Los Angeles school that is at the center of two child abuse cases. The school will be closed Tuesday and Wednesday to ""take a break,"" said the Los Angeles Unified School system. The district is the nation's second largest. When classes resume Thursday, a new staff and social workers will be at hand to receive students, said District Superintendent John Deasy. ""I can't have any more surprises at Miramonte,"" Deasy told an auditorium packed with parents Monday night. ""And if there are more, then we'll have to deal with that."" Everyone from current custodians to teachers at Miramonte will be relocated indefinitely, school officials said. Staffers are expected to get special training, Deasy said. The Miramonte staff members are being relocated neither permanently nor temporarily to a new school, school officials said. It will be up to the district to decide in the future where they will be assigned, they said. Technically, they are still considered Miramonte employees. Staffers and students will be questioned as part of the ongoing criminal investigation. Parents will also be given the option of transferring their children to one of four elementary schools in the area. ""The actions we are taking are not a condemnation of the entire staff,"" Deasy said. The moves weren't enough to appease outraged parents, who are demanding additional safeguards for the students. ""We're saying enough is enough,"" community leader Morris Grifton said at a demonstration Monday. ""We want cameras in the classrooms, in the hallways and around the school."" Monday night, about 100 parents fumed outside the South Region High School No. 2 auditorium, unable to get into a meeting with the superintendent because it was over capacity. ""The school authorities should have planned this meeting correctly to allow everyone in,"" said one parent, Gustavo Morales. ""If there's not enough room in the auditorium, then they should have at least had it in the football field."" Parent Bessy Garcia, the mother of two children who were among Berndt's alleged victims, spoke of betrayal. ""He wasn't only a teacher. He was our personal friend,"" she said. ""He tricked us. We thought he was the best person in the world."" She described how she and her two children were having trouble sleeping, eating and functioning as they wrestled with last week's disclosures. ""It's been like hell,"" said another parent, Claudia Rivera. ""We're just trying to get some answers."" The investigation into Berndt began in October 2010, when a drugstore photo technician told police he found images of blindfolded children in a processing order. After an initial investigation, investigators notified school authorities, who removed Berndt from his classroom in January 2011. The developments come as the school district is dealing with another case of alleged lewd behavior, involving a janitor at another school. On Sunday, the mother of a student at Germain Elementary School reported ""inappropriate contact"" between the custodian and her child, a Los Angeles Police Department statement said. The man, Paul Adame, was arrested and charged with a felony, police said. He has been released on $100,000 bail. At Miramonte, officials hope the steps they are taking will help assure parents they're serious about ""a thorough, vigorous and fair investigation of all allegations"" ""The safety, welfare and education of students is our No. 1 priority,"" the teachers union, United Teachers Los Angeles, said in a statement Monday night. ""We know that the public understands that the vast majority of teachers are doing remarkable work every day to motivate and educate the children of Los Angeles."" The replacements at Miramonte will come from a pool of applicants, including former employees, said district spokesman Waldman. ""We have had a lot of layoffs and budget cuts here and will also look at recent retirees,"" he said.

dadbcc0001ffb570e2976205079040f7d13ac65e,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama should end a longstanding policy of not writing letters of condolence to families of troops who commit suicide, dozens of lawmakers urged him in a letter Wednesday. The lawmakers warned that ""our armed forces are in the midst of a suicide epidemic."" U.S. Army statistics show that more than 200 troops have killed themselves this year, more than in 2008, which was a record year. ""By overturning this policy on letters of condolence to the families of suicide victims, you can send a strong signal that you will not tolerate a culture in our armed forces that discriminates against those with a mental illness,"" the lawmakers wrote. The White House has begun a review of the condolence policy, which the 46 members of Congress said should be completed as soon as possible. They also argued the policy of treating suicides differently from deaths in action flew in the face of military funeral procedure, which treats both the same. Service members who kill themselves get ""a full military burial, complete with flag-draped coffin and 21-gun salute. We have not heard of any reports that military morale and discipline have waned as a result,"" they wrote. They also argued that letters of condolence are ""as much about respect for the personal loss that a family experiences as it is about an acknowledgment by our nation that we have lost a soldier."" The White House said two weeks ago its review of the policy should ""hopefully"" conclude shortly. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president himself asked for the review. ""If the president didn't care, the policy would remain unchanged and unexamined,"" Gibbs said at a December 9 news conference. Despite this year's rise in suicides, Army officials said a recent trend downward could signal progress in programs intended to reduce the problem. Between January and mid-November, 140 active-duty soldiers killed themselves, as did 71 Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers. That's a total of 211 as of November 17, when Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the Army vice chief of staff, briefed reporters about the problem. But he said the monthly numbers are starting to slow down as the year nears its end. ""This is horrible, and I do not want to downplay the significance of these numbers in any way,"" Chiarelli said. For all of 2008, the Army said 140 active-duty soldiers killed themselves, while 57 Guard and Reserve soldiers committed suicide, totaling 197. While the lawmakers cited attitudes toward the mentally ill, the Army is still trying to tackle why soldiers are killing themselves. ""We still haven't found any statistically significant causal linkage that would allow us to effectively predict human behavior. The reality is, there is no simple answer -- each suicide case is as unique as the individuals themselves,"" Chiarelli said. He also said there were troubling new statistics showing an increase in suicide rates among young soldiers who have never deployed, another factor puzzling Army researchers. CNN's Adam S.

8f76e0fc1640360025c7e7431f7242feaa17369d,CNN,"(CNN)An Argentine judge has dismissed a criminal complaint accusing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and other top leaders of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires. The prosecutor who filed the case, Alberto Nisman, was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Judge Daniel Rafecas on Thursday ruled that Nisman's case did not meet the minimum threshold to initiate a criminal investigation. The government has denied the accusations from the beginning, and even some journalists who have pored through Nisman's report have said the case wasn't airtight. The 63-page ruling states that ""it is clear that neither of the two hypotheses of crimes made by the prosecutor in his complaint minimally hold up."" Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The two hypotheses that the judge referred to in his ruling were some of the key arguments made by Nisman. The prosecutor argued that the Argentine government's decision in 2013 to form a joint ""truth commission"" with Iran to investigate the bombing would hinder an honest examination. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. Nisman also alleged that Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman sought to withdraw from Interpol their requests for the arrests of several Iranian suspects. The judge ruled that because the truth commission has never been created, it can't have functioned as an instrument to cover up anything. Regarding Interpol, the judge said there is no evidence that the Argentine government took steps to have the international police body remove the so-called red notices against the Iranians. Addressing the accusation against Fernandez, the judge wrote that ""there is not one piece of evidence, not even a hint, that points to the current President regarding the instigating or planning of the grave crime of a cover-up. ..."" Nisman was found with a gunshot wound to his head in his apartment on January 18, a day before he was scheduled to testify before lawmakers about his accusations. Authorities have yet to determine if his death was a suicide or a homicide. Earlier this month, a new prosecutor who picked up Nisman's case said there was enough evidence to continue the criminal investigation. Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing Nisman's allegations. Thursday's ruling quashed his request for the investigation to proceed.

c0a3ccc8f35568664a4c4d9ba233ed59f3b9215f,CNN,"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama called Nancy Reagan on Friday to apologize for a remark about seances he made during his first news conference earlier in the day. President-elect Barack Obama's spokeswoman syas he apologized to Nancy Reagan for ""offhanded remark."" When a reporter asked Obama if he had spoken with any ex-presidents since his election on Tuesday, he responded that he had spoken to all former presidents ""that are living."" ""I didn't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any seances,"" he said. Nancy Reagan, wife of 40th President Ronald Reagan, was derided in 1988 when his former chief of staff Donald Regan revealed in a book that the first lady had consulted an astrologer to determine the president's schedule. Obama apologized to Reagan ""for the careless and offhanded remark,"" Obama transition team spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said.  Watch Obama make the seance remark » . ""The president-elect expressed his admiration and affection for Mrs. Reagan that so many Americans share and they had a warm conversation,"" Cutter said. President Reagan died in 2004 at 93. Other first ladies have reportedly used spiritual advisers. In his 1996 book, ""The Choice,"" Washington Post editor and writer Bob Woodward said that as first lady, Sen. Hillary Clinton had seance-like sessions at the White House during which she conversed with late first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. At the time, the White House said the sessions were not seances. Abraham Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, was rumored to have held seances at the White House in order to contact her two dead sons, Eddie and Willie. She also reportedly went to seances under an assumed name after the president's death to attempt to contact him. Immediately after the seance remark, Obama said he had ""re-read some of Lincoln's writings, who's always an extraordinary inspiration"" and mentioned that former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W.

8128c358f0df5f433a563f32fd98e77a02416b9f,CNN,"(CNN) -- Ahdaf Soueif isn't in one place for long. She has spent the last month touring India and Australia, and is back in her native Egypt for a few days before heading to London. She is in demand for speaking engagements, particularly at literary festivals, to help the world understand political events in Egypt, still in turmoil more than two years after its revolution. Soueif, 62, is a Booker-shortlisted author and political commentator whose most recent book ""Cairo: My City, Our Revolution"" gives a personal account of her involvement with the protests in January 2011 that led to the downfall of former president Hosni Mubarak. Soueif is not one for commentating from a safe distance. On the day before we speak, she has yet again joined protesters on the streets of Cairo. ""I came straight from the airport to the streets,"" she said. On January 25, 2011, when hundreds of thousands of protests began flooding into Tahrir Square in Cairo, Soueif was at a literary festival in Jaipur, India. ""I did my final event and then went sightseeing and shopping in Jaipur,"" she said. ""When I got back to my hotel I had I don't know how many messages, so I turned on the TV and saw what was happening in Tahrir Square."" She had been planning to spend another 10 days in India, but instead got the first flight back to Cairo to join the demonstrations. In her book, Soueif describes euphoria in joining the demonstrations with her two young nieces. ""It was grassroots, millions of people walking out,"" she said. ""It was amazing and totally inclusive."" For Soueif, the revolution that began in January 2011 is still a work in progress, because despite free presidential elections in June 2012, there have not been the changes in social justice that many were hoping for. Despite the setbacks and continuing violence, Soueif is adamant the country is better off than it was before 2011. ""I'm very optimistic,"" she said. ""The change that has happened in people was huge. People have broken free and expressed what they want."" Soueif said she joins protesters on the streets of Cairo two or three times a week when she is not traveling the globe on speaking engagements. ""It gets tiring, but at the same time it's re-energizing because there's a tremendous positive energy flowing,"" she said. ""It reminds you what it's all about and of the determination of people."" Soueif was born in Cairo to intellectual parents and spent her childhood between the United Kingdom and Egypt. She studied English literature at university in Cairo before researching a PhD in Britain. She married the late British poet Ian Hamilton, with whom she had two sons, Omar Robert Hamilton and Ismail Richard Hamilton. Soueif has written two novels, several collections of short stories, a book of essays and edited a hefty tome an Islamic art. Her second novel ""The Map of Love"" in 1993 made her the first Muslim woman to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. ""What it meant to me wasn't just about being the first Muslim woman or Arab, it was just great as a writer to make an impact,"" she said. ""Map of Love"" was translated into 28 languages, with the Arabic translation by her own mother. ""It was a tremendous privilege to work with her. She was incredible,"" said Soueif. ""We had some rows to begin with along the lines of 'whose book is it anyway?', but it was a very rich experience. ""I still remember the times when we would sit and mull over the right translation for a certain expression for hours."" In recent years, Soueif has been too busy as a columnist and commentator to write fiction, although hopes to write another novel when she can find time. Last year she was listed by Arabian Business magazine among its 100 most powerful Arab women. She is currently working on her own Arabic translation of her Cairo book, but is struggling to find time in her busy schedule. ""If I get two clear hours, that's what I work on,"" she said. Ahdaf Soueif will be appearing at the Women of the World Festival at London's Southbank Centre from March 8-10.",7,6.399685612918003
38b1b587ae20aa5f73b6482e30533283b1f47c10,CNN,"(CNN) -- A member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club was facing charges including assault with a deadly weapon Sunday after a brawl between club members devolved into a gunfight that left one person dead. Police identified the victim of the shooting at John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada, as Jeffrey Pettigrew, 51, president of the San Jose, California, chapter of the Hell's Angels. Two other people, both of California and members of the Vagos motorcycle club, were in stable condition at hospitals after being shot in the abdomen and the leg, respectively. Cesar Villagrana, 36, was arrested after surveillance video showed him ""shooting into the crowd"" during the Friday night melee, Sparks police said in a statement. ""However, it cannot be confirmed at this time if any of the projectiles struck the victims."" Besides assault with a deadly weapon, Villagrana also faces charges of carrying a concealed weapon; aiming a firearm at another; aiming or discharging a firearm where a person is endangered; and possession of stolen property/firearm, jail records show. His bail was set at $500,000 cash only. Authorities appealed to bystanders who may have photographed or videotaped the event to contact police. A second shooting occurred at 10:49 a.m. Saturday, police said. A motorcyclist was traveling down a street when a car pulled alongside him and he was shot in the stomach. The name of that victim was being withheld, but he was in stable condition, authorities said. Witnesses said a black four-door BMW with two people inside was seen speeding away just after the shooting. ""We are unable to definitively link the two shooting incidents at this time,"" police said. The incidents occurred during the Street Vibrations Fall Rally, an event that began Wednesday and was expected to continue into Sunday. After the shootings, however, the Sparks portion of the event were canceled through the weekend, the city announced Saturday. The mayor of Sparks also declared a state of emergency. ""Whenever you have people who enter our city with bad intentions, bad things are going to happen,"" Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said Saturday. Police said they have increased the number of foot and mobile patrols in the city. Authorities reported that as many as 30 people took part in the casino brawl. Police responded with assistance from overhead helicopters. There has been no violence since the Street Vibrations rally expanded into Sparks, police said. ""The Sparks Police Department wants to acknowledge the acts of these two motorcycle clubs do not represent a majority of the motorcycle enthusiasts that come to the Street Vibrations event,"" authorities said in a statement.

f203e30d37ba48b648d4ef45419bcb34dc89418f,CNN,"(CNN) -- It's the putt all golfers want to be stood over. The final hole of a Masters weekend, find the cup and the coveted green jacket is yours. Your heart is racing, your palms sweaty, can you maintain your focus? The contender surveys the scene, taking in the erupting volcano and giant wooden heads which line the Hawaiian Rumble course before delicately guiding her shot off a brick and into the hole. No, not the Augusta National Country Club, but a minigolf course in Myrtle Beach. Not Tiger Woods, but 18-year-old Olivia Prokopova, one of the world's leading minigolf players and a double Masters champion. ""I started playing as a three-year-old kid,"" the Czech told CNN. ""My dad worked as a sports reporter and he took me with him to an interview he did with a minigolf trainer. I tried to play there and really liked it. Apparently, I kept asking when we would go back to play more. ""Since then, I played regularly, and started going to tournaments."" Minigolf, commonly referred to as crazy golf, originated in 1867 at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews, Scotland. With women at the time keen to play the conventional game, and the violent swinging action required to hit a drive deemed most unladylike, an 18-hole course of putting greens was built. The rest, as they say, is history and 150 years later people from all over the world enjoy minigolf in a wide variety of locations on courses littered with tiny waterfalls and animatronic dinosaurs. It might not be as famous or well-known as the full-size game -- ""big golf,"" as Prokopova says -- but away from the fairways and bunkers of conventional courses is a hardcore community of players dedicated to golf's miniature cousin. And none are more dedicated than Bob Detwiler, the founder of the U.S. Pro Minigolf Federation. Detwiler opened the Hawaiian Rumble course in 1992 and decided to start holding tournaments. The first was the Masters in 1997, followed one year later by the U.S. Open. While the former is always held at Detwiler's course, the latter annually switches location, mirroring the long-established traditions of golf's equivalent tournaments. And the similarities have not been lost on those at Augusta National Golf Club, home since 1934 of what is now the season's opening major tournament. ""I've been called three of four times by the people at Augusta,"" explained Detwiler. ""They said I was infringing on their name and stuff. ""I said, 'How can that be? There's the Masters of tennis, of marbles. You name it, there's a Masters of it.' ""They asked me to do certain things, but they've never said I need to cease and desist."" The Hawaiian Rumble course -- ""our Augusta,"" boasts Detwiler -- annually attracts players from across the globe for the Masters, a tournament Prokopova has won in each of the last two years. While Adam Scott took home $1.44 million for his Green Jacket success in April, minigolf's event has a total prize fund of just $12,000. ""The season is expensive,"" admits Prokopova. ""Traveling to the U.S. is expensive. We usually go there three weeks to a month before a tournament. ""All prize money goes back into the travels, but I still need sponsors and my parents contribute to these trips."" Prokopova's commitment to the sport is unquestionable. Not only does she fly 4,500 miles to compete in the U.S., she is joined by an entourage including both of her parents, her coach and, if you believe Detwiler, even a masseuse. ""I was seven when I first traveled to the U.S. for a tournament,"" said Prokopova. ""The atmosphere was absolutely amazing. All the other players would stand around me and cheer, some of them screaming and jumping in the air."" Prokopova's fellow competitors tend to be middle-aged men who enjoy the heat of competition and the fraternity which comes with being an obscure sportsman. However Detwiler admits that some find losing to a teenage girl difficult to take. ""They've known her since she was seven years old, so they all like her,"" said Detwiler. ""But at the same time they want to win too. And they don't like it when some girl beats them!"" But the response to Propokova is almost entirely positive, with America's minigolf courses a home away from home for the prodigy. ""When at a tournament, it really feels like we are one big family,"" said Prokopova. ""We see each other regularly, at least twice a year, and we know each other. The players' community is very supportive, I don't feel much rivalry. ""I have once beaten the same player in sudden-death playoffs three times in row. He was a little upset and walked away briskly, but even then, he later came back and offered his congratulations. ""And that was the only time I could feel any sort of over-competitiveness."" As minigolf continues to grow, the sport's family could welcome more and more foreign members, with players from far and wide flocking to tournaments across the globe. ""The World Minigolf Federation is seeing a rise in player numbers, clubs and events and greater recognition of Minigolf as a sport,"" its sport director Pasi Aho told CNN. ""There are now 46 member nations in the World Minigolf Sport Federation, with South Korea and Mongolia our most recent members. ""With over 1,300 tournaments played each year, including World, European and Asian Championships, there are now 38,000 registered players competing in a wide range of tournaments."" For Prokopova, more major titles surely lie in wait. After all, she has won two green jackets before her 19th birthday, two more than 14-time major winner Woods had at that age. And Prokopova has set her sights on a showdown with ""big golf's"" biggest star. ""We have challenged Tiger Woods on several occasions, mainly through the media, but he never responded. Maybe he is afraid?!"" she joked. Over to you, Tiger... CNN's Ivana Kottasova contributed to this story.",7,7.538844114060688
0bbabf0982f33e6581203e4dc67c8d8fac3ed3bd,CNN,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after Demi Moore announced she wanted to end her marriage to Ashton Kutcher, their union is legally undone. Kutcher's lawyer filed the document in Los Angeles County Superior Court Tuesday making their final divorce settlement official, according to a court spokeswoman. Kutcher, 35, filed the divorce petition last January -- citing irreconcilable differences -- but Moore, 51, made it clear in November 2011 that the marriage was over. ""It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,"" Moore said in her announcement. Kutcher has been dating his former ""That '70s Show"" co-star Mila Kunis since early 2012, although she initially denied a romantic relationship. He is one of television's best paid performers thanks to the gig he got on CBS' ""Two and a Half Men"" after Charlie Sheen's implosion. Moore and Kutcher began dating in 2003 and married in September 2005 despite a 15-year age difference. In the wake of Moore's announcement of their split two years ago, Kutcher tweeted: ""I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK"" The separation, however, came amid reports that Kutcher cheated on his wife on the night of their wedding anniversary. ""As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,"" she said at the time. ""This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.""

c1804a5ec943bcb9f1d972548dca5fd4a4902f85,CNN,"(CNN) -- The inflatable-armbands community is rejoicing -- Asia's first Legoland Water Park opened in Malaysia this week. With more than 20 water attractions, 70 Lego models and 3 million liters of water, the 300,000-square-meter space is the world's largest Legoland Water Park, say park officials. Before you get too awestruck over such a grandiose claim to fame, it's worth noting there are only two other Legoland Water Parks in operation. Both are in the United States -- one in California, the other in Florida. Still, this place is impressive. Especially for the under-12 set. Apart from water slides and pools, one of the coolest attractions of the Legoland Malaysia Water Park is Build-A-Raft River, which lets kids put together their own raft made of soft Lego bricks and float through the park via a slow-moving current. The Joker Soaker is an interactive platform in a wade pool where kids can shoot water cannons as a jester tells jokes -- family-friendly ones, naturally -- as it unleashes 350 gallons of water upon their gleeful (or horrified?) little heads. For toddlers, the Duplo-themed play area has smaller slides and characters modeled after those found in Lego sets -- an alligator, polar bear and elephant. The new Legoland Water Park has two restaurants, private cabanas for rent and a store. More: Gallery: Asia's first Legoland opens in Malaysia . Legoland Malaysia hotel to open next year .

033a87088e242f15aeb422d7d0495c4c02bfd596,CNN,"(CNN) -- A bride is in mourning. Hours after the wedding, groom William Riley Knight, 49, of Crown Point, Indiana, was struck and killed. His new wife, Nikki Knight, was not injured. ""I went from a being a newlywed to a widow in less than 48 hours â€” the highest high to the lowest low,"" she told the Chicago Sun-Times on Sunday. ""It's a blur."" They had just left their reception, according to Patti Van Til, a spokeswoman with the Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff's Department. Nikki was still in her wedding dress, she said. Knight was acting as a good Samaritan on Saturday night when he stopped to assist Linda Darlington, whose vehicle had slid into a ditch along a road in Crown Point. He climbed out to help while his wife waited in the car. ""He said, 'We've got to stop, it's late and they need help,' "" Nikki, a registered nurse, told the Chicago newspaper.

ef7f8a147eb80ce027980904013a98c65fe2f636,CNN,"(CNN) -- Each day more than 55 million students attend the country's 130,000 schools. Each day, parents and guardians entrust some 7 million teachers with the education of our children. And on a normal day, that is all we expect teachers to do -- teach. But on those not-so normal days we are reminded that for six hours a day and more, five days a week, teaching is not the only thing teachers are charged with doing. On those not-so-normal days, we are reminded that teachers are also asked to be surrogate parents, protectors, heroes. Monday was one of those not-so-normal days. The nation watched in horror as a 2-mile-wide tornado with winds up to 200 mph tore through Moore, Oklahoma. As sirens blared and the ground shook, the full force of the twister hit Plaza Towers Elementary School around 3 p.m. It was full of students, young scared children who had nowhere to hide as the tornado ripped off the roof, sending debris everywhere. Heroes or just doing their jobs? Teacher save lives during tornado . ""We had to pull a car out of the front hall off a teacher and I don't know what her name is, but she had three little kids underneath her,"" a rescuer said. ""Good job teach."" And that teacher was not the only one whose body shielded children from harm. A couple of years ago, as state and local officials were looking for ways to cut spending, a study from the American Enterprise Institute emerged in 2011, asking a provocative question: Are teachers overpaid? Using abbreviated metrics -- such as comparing private sector employees' SAT and GRE scores with those of teachers -- the study's co-author Jason Richwine said the findings suggested that ""years of education could be an overestimate of cognitive skills."" A counterintuitive and insulting proposition. But in retrospect that shouldn't be too surprising considering Richwine's doctoral dissertation advocated keeping out immigrants with low IQs, which he maintained are lower than those of the ""native white population."" He also co-authored an attack on immigration reform for the Heritage Foundation. And he resigned as the group's senior policy analyst shortly afterward. Nevertheless, as educators in Chicago voted to strike and benefits such as tenure came under scrutiny, the question that study proposed sparked a national conversation and helped turn 2012 into a year in which teacher-bashing became a popular past time. But when I think of the importance of teaching in this country, when I think about the heroism demonstrated in Oklahoma, I find it impossible to overpay teachers. We can certainly talk about the realities of the economy, debate the best method to evaluate effectiveness and discuss the drawbacks of unions. But anyone who characterizes teachers as overpaid is forgetting what we entrust them with each and every day. Our children. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . On a normal day, you don't think about that too much. But on a not-so-normal day, that is all you can think about. Anne Marie Murphy, a mother of four, died trying to protect 6-year-old Dylan Hockley as Adam Lanza terrorized the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. When police found the two victims, Murphy was still holding Hockley in her arms. And five other educators did not run away from the threat but gave their lives trying to protect students, trying to protect children. How do you overpay for that? Obviously no parent or guardian drops their children off at school thinking tragedy is going to happen. But perhaps we should be grateful that if something terrible does happen, that there are these angels in the building who will do right by our kids. Who will give anything -- sometimes even their lives -- to protect them in our absence. One of the Plaza Towers teachers reportedly was lying on top of six students in a school bathroom to shelter them from the horrific storm. I'm sure that is not in the job description. So yes, it is fiscally responsible for a community to talk about loss of tax revenue and budget deficits. But we ought to be careful not to vilify this profession while doing so. Teachers are not glorified babysitters with summers off. Their profession fuels all others, and on a normal day that is amazing enough in and of itself. But on a day that's not so normal, we hope and pray that they are willing to do much more. And time and time again, in the face of terrible tragedies, we have learned that many of them do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.",5,9.307476016672712
a4ae9888a833fb76387d57f0f1928ca85857c9be,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tony Stewart's profession is driving for millions of dollars a year in NASCAR races, but his hobby is racing against amateurs on dirt tracks for trophies. Stewart, 43, started in go-carts when he was just 5 in Columbus, Indiana, 50 miles south of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He rose through the ranks, winning the Indy Racing League championship in 1997 before moving to NASCAR two years later. He's won three championships in NASCAR's top series -- the Sprint Cup -- and he's a co-owner of his racing team. Other drivers started calling him ""Smoke"" because that's what they saw coming from his tires as he steered aggressively through turns on asphalt tracks. While burning rubber wore down tire tread needed late in a race, it added to his reputation as one of the most competitive drivers, both behind the wheel and off the track. Sponsors pay big bucks to display their logos on Stewart's No. 14 car because they know millions will watch it speed around the big track hundreds of times in a single event, as many as three dozen weekends a year. His bad-boy antics, the fights and the words, make him stand out among dozens of other personalities in the sport. Even the fans who boo him are watching. He shows up unshaven on race days in contrast to more polished drivers who are more careful with words and actions to avoid alienating sponsors and fans. Winning, either on NASCAR's asphalt or unsanctioned dirt, is Stewart's goal. As he sacrifices valuable tire tread for track cred, he also puts great passion into his non-paying hobby, carried out at the risk of his big-money professional driving. Why one NASCAR champion loves dirt tracks . ""Being on a dirt track a lot of times is like being on a gravel road,"" Stewart said in a 2006 interview. ""If you go just a little bit too fast the car's going to slide. If you hit the gas too hard, it spins the tires or kicks the rocks up. If you try to stop too fast, you skid, you lock up the brakes. That's what makes driving on dirt more technical."" When he won a dirt track race in Michigan last month, he tweeted to fans as if he'd won the Daytona 500: ""If you haven't heard already, I ran my sprint car tonight and won! Felt great to run it again. Was a 2nd place car but had a little luck :)"" That ""little luck"" was the driver of the lead car crashing. Stewart was leading a 30-lap dirt track race at Southern Iowa Speedway a year ago when his car flipped, breaking two bones in his right leg. It ended his NASCAR Sprint Cup 2013 season 15 races early, costing him and his sponsors a lot of money. The August 11, 2013, race at Watkins Glen, New York, was the first start Stewart missed in 521 NASCAR races since his 1999 debut at the Daytona 500. Ironically, he missed Watkins Glen again this year because of a dirt track tragedy on Saturday. Tony Stewart hits, kills driver at dirt-race track . Stewart hit and killed another driver, Kevin Ward Jr., during a sprint car race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in Ontario County, New York. Video shows that Ward and Stewart appeared to make contact coming out of a turn and Ward hit the wall and was knocked out of the race. Ward, 20, then got out of his car and walked down the track toward the other racers, who had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward pointed a finger and appeared to be yelling. One car swerved to avoid him, but Stewart's right-rear tire appears to hit him as he passes. ""There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" Stewart said in a written statement. Why Tony Stewart isn't likely to face charges . Veteran race fans remember a rookie driver who jumped out of his car during a NASCAR race in 1999 after another driver spun his car into him in Martinsville, Virginia. That driver was Tony Stewart. Stewart had traded bumps throughout the race with Kenny Irwin, who had been his dirt-track rival before they both moved up to NASCAR. But the last crash against the wall disabled Stewart's car. Stewart waited on the track for Irwin to circle around under a caution flag. Stewart threw his gloves at Irwin's car, and jumped onto its right side while the car was still moving. Stewart's run-ins with other drivers are legend, including after his car crashed with Matt Kenseth at Tennessee's Bristol Motor Speedway in 2012. Stewart waited in a driving lane on pit road for Kenseth's car to return to the track. Stewart threw his helmet at Kenseth as the car sped by. He told reporters later that he doesn't ""enjoy getting mad like that."" Stewart rushed after driver Joey Logano on pit row after a Fontana, California, race last year. He was angry that the younger Logano had blocked him from passing during a restart. Logano said he was just ""racing hard"" because he thought he could win. Stewart has also had his angry moments with fans and the media. He was investigated, though never prosecuted, for an alleged assault against a female fan at Bristol Motor Speedway in 2002, the year he won his first of three NASCAR championships. NASCAR officials fined Stewart $10,000 and ordered him to get anger management counseling for hitting a photographer after a bad race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2002. Stewart has removed himself from racing for the present in the aftermath of Ward's death. He will not compete in a dirt track race in Plymouth, Indiana, next Saturday as he had planned, the track announced Monday. He has not yet decided if he will race in the next NASCAR Sprint Cup event at Michigan International Speedway next Sunday, his spokesman, Mike Arning said Monday.

7d16fbe67a96e115edb46aaedb9ab8fa36ff77c2,CNN,"(CNN)  -- A 6.7-magnitude earthquake hit near the Greek island of Crete on Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck at 12:30 p.m. (5:30 a.m. ET), the USGS said. It was centered about 80 miles (130 kilometers) off the city of Iraklion on Crete, the USGS said. An earthquake with a 6.7 magnitude is capable of causing significant damage, especially in areas of poor construction. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. A staff member at Iraklion Airport told CNN they didn't feel the earthquake. Similar reports came from staff members at hotels just outside Iraklion and in western Crete. A spokesman at the Greek Ministry of Health in Athens, 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the epicenter, also said he didn't feel the quake. David Booth, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, explained that the earthquake happened deep below the sea, leading to little risk of tsunami and reducing the likelihood that people would feel tremors. -- CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Krsna Harilela in London, England, contributed to this report.",2,8.341002134014776
f58bdbca13f2ecab7f106824c1ec53347cf1524a,CNN,"(CNN) -- There is a little good news for mothers in the United States. The U.S. has moved up six places -- from 31st to 25th -- in the annual Save The Children State of the World's Mothers report. That puts the U.S. right between Belarus and the Czech Republic. Norway is No. 1, just ahead of Iceland and Sweden. The report's ranking of 165 nations factors in measures of education, health and economic status as well as the health and nutrition of children. ""There's still an awful lot that we need to do,"" said Carolyn Miles, the president of Save The Children. The U.S. has made strides with respect to better care for teen moms and also in electing more women to government positions, which the organization sees as an important measure of how society values women. But it has to do more, Miles and others stress. ""We valorize parenthood and in particular, motherhood, while at the same time we offer very few supports,"" said Robin Simon, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University. So while the U.S. recognizes mothers for their incredibly important role as the primary caregivers to children, it still hasn't done enough to help raise the kids. It's no secret: Raising a child is stressful and really expensive. A new mother needs a lot of help, Simon said, and other countries provide more government assistance than the United States does. ""Unlike other industrialized nations, we lack the kind of state-level protections and policies that would reduce some of that stress,"" she said, speaking of ""family-friendly entitlement programs"" like universal health care. Another place the United States could start improving is with maternity leave. Thanks to the 2-decade-old Family and Medical Leave Act, new mothers get 12 weeks of unpaid leave. In Canada, it's 52 weeks, 50 of which are paid. Canada, by the way, is 19th in the rankings. Kirsten Swinth, a professor of history at Fordham University who is working on a book on the cultural history of the working American mother, said companies that do offer paid leave do so more for professional middle- and upper-ranked workers. ""That tends to leave lower-paid and less-skilled workers behind so there's an inequality in the distribution of those benefits,"" she said. The poor around the world are victims of growing inequality, the Save The Children report shows. The gap between the level of care and commitment to mothers and children in the top 10 nations -- all developed countries -- and the bottom 10 is growing, Miles said. Here's a statistic that jumps right at you: In bottom-ranking Niger, almost every mother will lose at least one child in her lifetime. It is the opposite in Norway, where every birth is attended to by a health professional. Miles, a mother of three, said she has talked to women in the poorest countries who had no other person present at the birth of their children. She said her organization has been working hard for the past five years to make sure there are more health workers to attend to births in those countries. ""Forty percent of children that die under the age of 5 die in the first month,"" she said. ""And the most dangerous day for a child is the day they are born."" The report isn't entirely deflating. There is good news from perennial last-place Afghanistan, which moved up one notch. It doesn't look significant in the report's black and white type, but it is, Miles said. ""It reflects some real progress in that country,"" she said, pointing to the fact that there is a much higher rate of education for girls there. Education is one vital component in improving the lives of mothers, Swinth said. ""There's very clear evidence for people who do this kind of work that when you provide women access to education, that when you provide them access to independent abilities to support themselves, and then when you provide them with health care, maternal and infant health go up in correspondence with each other,"" she said. She said it happens in industrialized nations too where consistent, reliable programs for prenatal and maternal health care are provided. ""You can see a correlation for better outcomes for mothers and children,"" she said. Some of the solutions don't have to be hard, Miles said. ""We talk about the 'lifesaving six' things in nutrition, and one of those is breast-feeding practices,"" she said. And everyone needs to pitch in, she said. Certainly moms need to take the lead, but governments also need to establish friendly policies toward breast-feeding and companies need to welcome it. It's one of the most important things that can save kids' lives, along with providing clean water, Miles said. ""It has to be everyone saying, 'This doesn't have to happen in our country.'""",5,10.43615024981985
c8c6ffb44930dbc57be1c1893a861e2a3de04291,CNN,"(CNN)The first day of same-sex marriage turned out to be a mixed bag for Alabama. While many couples converged on courthouses in population centers like Montgomery, Birmingham and Huntsville to exchange vows, other would-be newlyweds -- the majority of them in rural counties -- were turned away. ""It was so joyous to be able to see these couples who had been together for 20, 30 years to marry and to have their relationship respected,"" said Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama. At the same time, she said, it was ""painful to couples who want to get married and who were denied."" It's unclear exactly how many counties issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples after federal courts ruled they could go forward on Monday. Several counties, including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison (which have the state's highest populations of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute) told CNN they were issuing licenses, while others said they were following a Sunday order from state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore telling probate judges not to issue the licenses because the federal courts lacked jurisdiction. Tuscaloosa County chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the county would follow Moore's guidance and, ""We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses."" Likewise, Lee County Judge Bill English said he, too, was ""complying with an order from the chief justice late last night."" As of late Tuesday, at least 44 counties were not issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 21 were, said Human Rights Campaign spokesman Ianthe Metzger. His group was still trying to get confirmation on two counties. The ACLU's Alabama office, which set up a hot line, received complaints from about 50 couples, Watson said. It was widely reported that some counties weren't issuing any licenses. Marshall and Shelby counties' probate offices told CNN they were in that group. Watson's organization is now working to obtain a federal court order to explain ""to probate judges that they're required to follow the U.S. Constitution"" rather than Moore's order, she said. A hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Alabama's Southern District in Mobile, which, incidentally, is one of the counties that reportedly did not issue the licenses. A call to the Mobile County Probate Court was not returned. Mobile County has the state's fourth-highest population of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute, and the ACLU of Alabama is involved in a lawsuit filed by four same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in the county, Watson said. Though Watson believes the federal courts were unequivocal in allowing same-sex marriages to go forward in the state, Moore -- who issued his order in response to a U.S. District Court ruling, prior to a similar ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday -- couldn't agree less. In fact, had the Supreme Court ruled on the issue before he sent his order to probate judges, he said he still would have gone through with it. ""The Supreme Court order doesn't affect what I said,"" he said. Because the original lawsuit -- filed by a woman who, despite being legally married in California, was prohibited from adopting her partner's 9-year-old -- targets only Attorney General Luther Strange, the high court's ruling applied only to Strange, Moore said. And since probate courts fall under Moore's authority as the administrative head of the judicial branch, he said, judges were free to disregard the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which declined to extend a stay on Alabama's prohibition of same-sex marriages beyond Monday. A federal district court and appeals court had also declined Strange's request to extend the stay. Moore denied Jefferson County Probate Judge Alan King's assertion that Moore's Sunday order was akin to then-Gov. George Wallace's 1963 stand in the schoolhouse door to block integration at the University of Alabama. In Alabama, he noted, Amendment 774, or the Sanctity of Marriage Act, makes it unconstitutional to perform same-sex marriages or civil unions. It passed with 81% approval in 2006. (A 2012 poll says that approval for same-sex marriage in the state is 32%, among the lowest in the country.) ""I'm not standing in any door. I did not bring this on. This was forced upon our state. This is simply federal tyranny,"" he said. ""This is not about race. This is about entering into the institution of marriage."" The chief justice, who once lost his post in 2003 for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from a state building in Montgomery, said his decision was not based on his religion. Unlike sexuality, he said, race cannot be used to deny someone's rights. Race is biologically predetermined, where in the case of sexuality, ""people can choose different lifestyles and no doubt they have since Sodom and Gomorrah,"" he said, referring to the cities destroyed in the Bible's Book of Genesis. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to address the larger issue -- specifically, whether same-sex marriage in four states deserves the protection of the U.S. Constitution -- later this year. While Moore doesn't believe the high court has the jurisdiction to redefine the definitions of family and marriage, he concedes that if the justices rule same-sex marriage is constitutionally protected, Alabama judges would have to honor the unions under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. However, ""I will not concur that that is a proper ruling under the Constitution of the United States,"" he said, explaining his personal beliefs. Watson and other observers believe the Monday decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a sign of what's to come when the high court rules on the larger issue. ""I think that tells us something about what we might expect,"" she said. Moore doesn't see any writing on the wall. ""I don't think the ruling is a harbinger,"" he said. ""Justices (Elena) Kagan and (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg both have performed same-sex marriages. They should both be recused from this case. When you have a predisposition ... you have no right to sit on the case. They're flouting the ethical rules that apply to most judges in this country."" CNN's Devon M.

66739f125dc4ab558b741ba45ac4a7870447c68c,CNN,"(CNN) -- For all the heavy baggage that she carries, Hillary Clinton is walking on water. Ham-fisted attempts by the Republicans to smear her brain have backfired horribly (rightly so; they were distasteful), while Republican efforts to hang Benghazi around her neck (Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried this weekend) have barely dented her popularity among Democrats. Obama calls her a ""buddy"" who would make a ""very effective"" president, and the former secretary of state remains clear front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination. In fact, right now, she's the only real runner. And that can't be healthy -- for democracy, for the Democrats or even for Clinton. How can we be sure she's running? Well, the United States might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book. This does not, alas, mean that America's politicians are unusually literate. Often, the book is bad; usually, it's ghostwritten; only occasionally is it worth reading. But it's generally a sign. The title of Hillary Clinton's ""Hard Choices"" -- out on June 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with TV's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past. Becoming Obama's secretary of state, Egypt, Libya and the Benghazi fiasco were all arguably ""choices"" forced upon her. That they were ""hard"" implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable. Clinton is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two. First, the Bill Clinton administration; second, the Obama administration. In both cases, she seems keen to remind us, she wasn't technically in charge. Such is the strange ambiguity of Hillary Rodham Clinton. First, she was the co-president and architect of Bill's most ambitious domestic reforms, the anti-Tammy Wynette. Then, she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man. Next the liberal senator, the presidential candidate of the overwhelming majority of the establishment, suddenly a primaries loser who had to reinvent herself as Annie Oakley, finally a loyal servant of the President, a man whose abilities she questioned so rudely in the nomination battle. Like Richard Nixon before her, she is one of those politicians who is defined by longevity. Her politics have changed so often that it's hard to precisely define what Clintonism is anymore, but she has lasted so long in the spotlight that it's become almost impossible to conceive that someday she won't be president. That 2016 is Clinton's time is reflected in the surprising, even depressing, lack of an alternative. What is Vice President Joe Biden doing with his weekends? Or Newark Mayor Cory Booker (who has ruled himself out, if you can believe that)? Or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Without them, who are we left with? Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, headed for Iowa but probably not very well known there? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, sometimes pushed as the working-class Hillary but who would probably be unelectable outside of Massachusetts? Warren, interestingly, has written a book, too. Contrast this silence with the Republican side. The GOP is weighing up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (whether they've showed any interest in running or not), and this pre-contest contest gives the impression that all the action is on the right while the Democrats just sit out what remains of Obama's second term, waiting for the whole thing to come to a dignified end. Stabenow: Why I'm ready for Hillary . And the Republican struggle is attractively philosophical. Paul represents the rise of libertarianism; Christie channels the spirit of Mayor Richard Daley; Bush is our generation's Nelson Rockefeller; Santorum is running to build heaven on Earth. These people are discussing ideas that will shape the future of the country. Clinton is talking largely about herself. Of course, two years is almost an eternity in politics, and things might change. At pretty much this point in the 2008 contest, Clinton also commanded a lead over her opponents and looked set to win the nomination -- and we all know what happened come Iowa. She is a different kind of politician now, having built statesman status with her time as secretary of state. But headed into her second go at the nomination after over 20 years of dominating the national stage, it's possible that many voters will simply decide that they want a change. Is America really so locked in its partisan, elitist politics that would tolerate another Clinton vs. Bush campaign? Those who think continuity is unhealthy in a democracy might judge not.",1,11.4654441304201
43a626a249f65c1fc9ae66968f8116155a1aaaef,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- Less money means less military, the nation's armed forces chiefs told Congress on Wednesday. The heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines explained -- again -- to the House Armed Services Committee that their services will be unable to meet their strategic responsibilities if forced budget cuts in coming years take effect as planned. The forced cuts, known in Washington-speak as sequestration, affect the military and other discretionary government spending except for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. At Wednesday's hearing, the military chiefs all said sequestration cuts in coming years would leave their forces without the resources needed to fulfill the requirements of the Obama administration's strategic defense guidance for the military through 2020. ""These reductions will put at substantial risk our ability to conduct even one sustained major combat operation,"" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told the panel, adding that it was ""imperative that Congress not implement the tool of sequestration."" Calling himself a realist, Odierno said the end result would be an 18% cut in total Army forces over seven years. ""There are some who have suggested there will be no land wars in the future,"" Odierno said. ""While I wish that were true, unfortunately there is little to convince me that we will not ask our soldiers to deploy again in the future."" Past reductions in military readiness showed that ""the full burden of an unprepared and hollow force will fall directly on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform,"" he added. ""We have experienced this too many times in our nation's history to repeat this egregious error again,"" he said. The hearing came amid another budget war in Congress, with threats of a government shutdown in less than two weeks without a compromise. One issue in the budget debate is whether a new spending plan should contain the sequestration cuts forced by a 2011 budget deal. Both Democrats and Republicans say they don't want sequestration, but they cannot agree on a new spending plan. Republicans insist on holding overall spending to the level that included the sequestration cuts, while Democrats generally want to provide some more funding while adjusting spending levels.

65909c7e22a8453964a9ac16301b773c93eb07c2,CNN,"(CNN) -- It's a fun way to address a serious problem. Weightless teachers float around inside a modified 727 with padded walls and ceilings. Many in the U.S. tech industry worry that not enough students are pursuing careers in engineering, math, and science. So the Northrop Grumman Foundation is sending teachers on the ride of their lives -- a weightless experience aboard a plane chartered from the Zero Gravity Corporation. Northrop, an aerospace and defense company, says the idea is for teachers to take their exhilarating experience back to their classrooms -- and inspire in their students a love of science. Northrop Grumman spokesman Tom Henson said the Weightless Flights of Discovery program is aimed at middle school teachers. ""Information has shown us that if kids are going to lose an interest in math and science, it's going to be during these years,"" he said. ""So we've targeted these teachers to try to illustrate for their students how math and science can be cool and relevant and applied to their daily lives, and just fun."" The program is three years old. This year, Northrop conducted weightless flights in California, Florida, Illinois and Georgia.  Watch teachers experience zero gravity » . From a pool of applicants, Northrop selected 60 teachers from each location. Before each flight, the teachers took part in a workshop in which they designed experiments to be conducted on the flight. The experiments were to test Newton's Laws of Motion; for instance, seeing how objects fall in microgravity in order to explain the difference between mass and weight. The flights took place aboard a modified 727. There are seven rows of seats in the back of the jet; the rest of the cabin is open and windowless, except for the emergency exits. The floors, walls and ceilings are padded. CNN accompanied the teachers on one of the Georgia flights, which took off from Atlanta's airport. The plane performed its weightless maneuvers over a chunk of airspace 100 miles long by 10 miles wide over the Atlantic Ocean. Specially trained pilots took the plane into a series of parabolas, essentially a series of up-and-down curves. As the 727 crested and descended each parabola, it created a microgravity environment that lasted about 30 seconds. The plane flew 15 parabolas. The first simulated the gravity felt on Mars (1/3 the gravity of Earth) and the next two recreated gravity felt on the moon (1/6 Earth gravity). This helped the teachers acclimate to the weightlessness of zero gravity felt on the last 12 parabolas. Tracy Heffelfinger, who teaches at Little Mill Middle School in Forsyth County, Georgia, said the experience gave her a great appreciation for what astronauts have to do in space. ""As a science teacher, you're told what all affects how you move, and that gravity is a great portion of that,"" she said. ""It's another thing to get up there and experience it. I would try things like, I just wanted to hover off the ground a little bit, but the problem is if you push up enough to get off the ground, there's nothing to stop you and you keep going until you hit the ceiling."" Heffelfinger said the experience will make it a lot easier to bring science to life for her students. Northrop's Henson said the flights have already helped the 780 teachers who participated in the program in 2006 and 2007, according to a recent Northrop poll of those teachers. ""Roughly 92 percent said there's been a noticeable increase in their students' overall interest in science since this program,"" he said. ""Almost 75 percent saw an increased number of students expressing a desire to continue studying science, which is important, because we're trying to keep students from dropping out of science in the middle school years."" Henson also said nearly 78 percent of the educators reported a rise in the number of students planning to pursue a math- or science-related career. ""I think the program is reaching who it needs to reach,"" he said. Northrop estimated 31,000 students have gotten the ""science is cool"" message from this program. Aboard the Atlanta flight, teachers screamed in delight and amazement as they defied gravity. They launched themselves like Superman, drank floating globs of water and tossed each other around like balls, in addition to performing a variety of experiments. A few educators experienced motion sickness. Parabolic flight is the same technique used to train astronauts, and the NASA jet is nicknamed ""the vomit comet."" But astronauts are sent on 40 or more parabolas per flight, while the teachers experienced only 15, which minimized the discomfort. Heffelfinger said she had no problems, even though her students had teased her about the possibility. ""I'm very proud of the fact that I'll be able to show them my unused barf bag,"" she said with a laugh.",6,7.9810716823845445

Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Authorities say hundreds of homes have been lost with the worst hit areas in the Blue Mountains, a World Heritage area to the west of Sydney, sending thick plumes of smoke into the air. Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service. Earlier Thursday, the fire service tweeted that 34 blazes were still out of control. More than 100 firefighters were battling flames in Heatherbrae, where one fire has so far destroyed 3,500 hectares (8,649 acres), the service said.

Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende said the casualty count in Maule, originally reported at 587, included more than 200 people who are missing but not confirmed dead. Therefore, the official nationwide death toll is lower than the 802 figure given by emergency authorities. In an attempt to reduce confusion, Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans who had been killed and identified by Thursday evening. He said he would update that official number regularly. This new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. With disasters of this magnitude, ""the number of dead change daily,"" Rosende said. ""It takes months sometimes to compile the information because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene."" Rosende also announced that President Michelle Bachelet has called for three days of national mourning, beginning Sunday. He called Chileans to fly the country's flag outside their homes as a sign of solidarity for the earthquake's victims. Bachelet toured devastated parts of central and southern Chile on Thursday, five days after the 8.8-magnitude earthquake. Bachelet first visited the battered seaport of Talcahuano, where a quake-induced tsunami roared through many parts of the city. See scenes of devastation . Wearing a blue windbreaker and surrounded by military, local dignitaries and TV cameras, Bachelet walked for several blocks before stopping to make a lengthy statement. ""This is the time for action,"" Bachelet said upon her return to the capital Thursday afternoon, where she met with leaders of the Catholic Church. The church has been a partner in providing help in the quake's aftermath. The top priority remained the needs of those affected, followed by reconstruction efforts, the president said. ""Despite the adversity, despite the challenges, Chile will come out on top,"" she said. Monsignor Alejandro Goic shared a note from Pope Benedict XVI expressing sadness for the tragedy and supporting the Chilean people. ""This is the time for unity,"" Goic said. Talcahuano, the nearby city of Concepcion and other parts of the region were the hardest-hit areas and the scene of days of looting and lawlessness. Many residents, including the mayor of Concepcion, complained that federal aid was slow in arriving. Some aid still had not arrived Thursday. ""Today we have not received one measure of water from the National Emergency Office, understanding that there are some difficulties,"" said Eduardo Soto, mayor of Rancagua in central Chile. Bachelet dispatched more than 13,000 soldiers and other military personnel to restore order in the area. Food and water started to arrive late Tuesday in Concepcion, and officials said they distributed 3,500 aid packages on Wednesday. She later toured Talca, another devastated area. Watch rescue efforts under way . President-elect Sebastian Pinera does not take office until March 11, but he named six officials Thursday to head up recovery efforts. ""Our government will not be a government of the earthquake,"" Pinera said in a speech in which he named the six individuals. ""Our government will be a government of reconstruction."" In other developments, the Chilean Davis Cup tennis team will open competition in Coquimbo, Chile, against Israel on Saturday, not on Friday. Team officials and players said they would be playing in honor of the quake's victims and that they hope to bring the country happiness.

Also Thursday, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit northern Chile, the opposite part of the country devastated by last week's quake. No immediate reports of damage or injuries have been made. A telethon, dubbed ""Chile Helps Chile"" by organizers, was slated for Friday to raise funds for quake victims. Bachelet's visits to the hard-hit areas came a few hours after new tremors rocked parts of Chile early Thursday. A 4.9-magnitude aftershock struck near the already devastated Maule region about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It came hours after a 6.1-magnitude aftershock struck near Valparaiso, raising fears that already vulnerable buildings could topple. More than 120 aftershocks of 5.0 magnitude or greater have hit Chile since Saturday's earthquake, USGS geophysicist Don Blakeman said. Concepcion is less than 10 miles inland from Talcahuano, but the two towns suffered very different fates. In Concepcion, fatalities and injuries resulted largely from buildings that had collapsed. Ninety-two people died in Concepcion, police commander Eliecer Solar Rojas told reporters Thursday morning. In coastal Talcahuano, the damage was caused by a tsunami that roared into town about an hour after the quake. When the waters receded, they left large boats stranded inland. In one spot, four shrimping vessels were stacked on top of each other. Much of the port city looked as if a bomb had exploded in it, with buildings reduced to rubble.

In the central city of Talca, an ancient municipality, the earthquake wiped out many older adobe structures, crushing hundreds of residents. Thursday's early morning aftershock struck about 40 miles north of Talca. In the seaside town of Constitucion, survivors tried to hold on to the little that remained. Saturday's earthquake had flattened rows and rows of homes, leaving a path of destruction that led to the sea.

06f4ffc582d7bbca31ce3cf70adda28570fc2177,CNN,"(CNN) -- England clinched rugby's Six Nations title for the first time since 2003 on Saturday despite crashing to a 24-8 defeat to Ireland in the final round in Dublin. Martin Johnson's team could have been denied the crown along with the Grand Slam achievement of winning all five games, but closest rivals Wales lost 28-9 to France in the tournament's concluding match. Johnson was captain of the England team that won the European competition for the 25th time eight years ago and then went on to lift the World Cup in Australia, and he will be hoping history repeats ahead of this year's premier event in New Zealand. ""This is a scar and we'll have to wear that scar. I told the players we'll take this on the chin. We were beaten by a good team, an experienced team,"" the coach said in quotes reported by the UK Press Association. ""The boys are very disappointed because they wanted to win a Test match, and we know what was at the end of it. We had a horrible first half. We were always chasing the game. ""It summed up our day up when two of our players ended up passing straight back to them. When you're in a fight you want to feel like you've landed a few blows, but we didn't. They kept on taking shots at us."" Recalled fly-half Jonathan Sexton kicked 14 points in a man-of-the-match performance, with his four penalties and a try from winger Tommy Bowe giving Ireland a 17-3 halftime lead. Seven minutes after the restart, captain Brian O'Driscoll became the record tryscorer in Six Nations history with his 25th crossing -- and Sexton converted to make it 24-3. England's only try was a runaway intercept effort from hooker Steve Thompson, which fellow replacement Jonny Wilkinson could not convert. Wales went into the match in Paris needing to win by 27 points to finish ahead of England on countback, but the team's preparation was marred by the absence of assistant coach Shaun Edwards due to a reported incident with a fellow member of the backroom staff last weekend. Coach Warren Gatland refused to comment on the incident in his pre-game interview, saying that it was ""an internal matter."" Defending champions France finished second following two tries to forward Lionel Nallet and another to winger Vincent Clerc, while Morgan Parra kicked 13 points. Wales' only reply was three penalties to flyhalf James Hook, who was sinbinned for a dangerous tackle, as Gatland's team finished fourth behind Ireland after three teams ended with six points each. In the day's opening game, Scotland avoided the wooden spoon by beating Italy 21-8 in Edinburgh to condemn the visitors to bottom place. The tournament has been known as the Six Nations since the addition of Italy in 2000, and started out in 1883 with four teams. France joined the competition for the first time in 1910, rejoining 37 years later.",7,9.90473686558232
45d28caa21c8a799c2eac872f64994595d2e76df,CNN,"(CNN) -- As the toll of international sanctions on Iran continues to mount, Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani has signaled his government's interest in addressing the world's concerns over his nation's nuclear program, and easing the pain on the Iranian economy. Rouhani's recent statements, tweets and appointments have underscored a possible willingness to resolve the nuclear problem. He told NBC News Wednesday that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons. At the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York next week, Rouhani is expected to affirm his interest in resolving the issue. In another positive step, President Barack Obama and Rouhani have exchanged lettersâ€”the first direct communication at this level between the two countries in many, many years. Explaining that this does not yet mean there is a breakthrough, President Obama indicated that he expects negotiations to be difficult and take time. ""Negotiations with the Iranians is always difficult,"" Obama said to George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy."" Indeed, there is little reason to necessarily believe that everything has suddenly changed for the better. After years of intransigence, many wonder whether Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who holds overwhelming authority, is ready to make honest concessions. Furthermore, it's not yet clear whether Iran understands that a mere change in rhetoric won't mean automatic sanctions relief. In fact, only its concrete actions to resolve the nuclear questions will lead to a meaningful relief of sanctions. And when they come, those actions may initially be incremental, negotiated to test the willingness of both sides to take confidence-building actions that will lead to more comprehensive progress. The United States should not dismiss Iran's rhetoric and its apparent litmus testing as insignificant. Though a deal will be difficult, as many negotiations are, it's not impossible to reach an agreement if Iran is willing to take the steps necessary. That, of course, is still a big ""if."" It's no secret among diplomats and experts what a final deal will probably look like: Iran will retain a small level of enrichment capability under a very strict regimen of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will also have ready access. So far, such a deal has never been in reach; the United States and its diplomatic partners still have a long way to go. Because of this, some would rather continue to fight for complete Iranian capitulation and zero ability to conduct nuclear activities of any sort, a result that does not allow the Iranian regime a chance to ""save face."" This ""all-or-nothing"" outcome is simply not realistically attainable by means short of a major military intervention. As a result, the United States should be exhausting all diplomatic opportunities to reach an agreement that best preserves its security and the security of the region, while allowing the Iranians a chance to reach a settlement they can live with. Congress has an important role in this delicate moment. Though the United States should remain skeptical of Iranian intentions, it should not turn down an opportunity that may be presenting itself. One of its biggest bargaining chips is the congressional sanctions, the presence of which, at this point, could be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to support a diplomatic solution. Congress needs to be flexible in its approach and refrain at this time from tacking on additional sanctions or authorizing military force if it is serious about giving diplomacy the room it needs to operate and not missing a possible opening. Ultimately, it won't be easy to resolve a decade's worth of issues over Iran's drive for a nuclear capability. But there is also no better time to put the Iranians to the test and see if they are truly willing to play ball and match their actions to their rhetoric on the diplomatic scene.

f872ce01c81315710f8b9de8eab8952df8065495,CNN,"(CNN) -- Dockworkers at a major London port discovered 35 people inside a shipping container Saturday morning. One of them, an adult male, was declared dead at the scene, according to Essex police Superintendent Trevor Roe. Several others -- including children -- were said to have ""significant health problems,"" according to a police statement. Daniel Gore of England Ambulance Service said the patients -- all of whom were conscious when they were found -- are being treated for dehydration and hypothermia at three London-area hospitals. None of their conditions are believed to be life-threatening, he said. What caused the one death was not yet known. A homicide investigation is under way, according to Roe. 'Screaming and Banging' Workers at Tilbury Docks made the discovery after ""screaming and banging was heard from inside the container,"" Roe said. The stowaways are from the Indian subcontinent, said Roe, but it was not immediately clear if that is where their maritime journey originated, or when it did. What is known is that the container they were in arrived to Tilbury -- located on the River Thames about 30 miles east of London -- aboard a ship owned by P&O Ferries at 6 a.m. (1 a.m. ET) from the Belgian port city of Zeebrugge after a nearly nine-hour trip. Company spokeswoman Natalie Hardy told CNN that P&O Ferries operates two such trips a day between London and Zeebrugge. She said P&O Ferries does not inspect the contents of the containers it transports as a matter of company policy. Such checks, according to Hardy, are the responsibility of the UK Border Agency. There were 50 containers on the ship, according to Roe. He said they would all be thoroughly searched. British authorities blasted the ""criminal networks"" engaged in human trafficking. ""Today's tragic incident at Tilbury is a reminder of the often devastating human consequences of illegal migration,"" Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said in a statement. ""This incident is now a criminal investigation.

e48f1dd45731e7a44768a8f0cd7a8fc3a9867642,CNN,"(CNN) -- The economy of Thailand -- whose growth this year so far has belied its political ails -- is now seeing more of a direct impact as protests grow increasingly violent. Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an ""incalculable impact on investor confidence."" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. ""The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,"" said Korn. ""Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater."" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. ""Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,"" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. ""Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,"" Korn said. ""Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July."" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. ""Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,"" Korn said. ""That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,"" Korn said. ""But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.""

Anh ""Joseph"" Cao says his win shows that ""really anything can happen."" ""I am very honored and at this point, somewhat speechless to be the first Vietnamese-American congressman,"" Anh ""Joseph"" Cao told CNN on Sunday. ""But I also hope that many of our young people will consider being more politically active and being move involved in the community. Because as you can see, really anything can happen."" The Republican defeated nine-term Democratic Rep. William Jefferson in the mostly African-American and heavily Democratic New Orleans-area district. Jefferson had been expected to win a 10th term despite battling scandals and a federal indictment for the past three years. The contest, which drew a light turnout, was delayed until Saturday after Hurricane Gustav swept through southern Louisiana in late August. Had the vote been held during the November 4 general election, Jefferson -- who is black -- may have benefited from the heavy African-American voter turnout for Barack Obama. Cao conceded that low voter turnout aided his victory. ""We were hoping for a low turnout because it would provide us with the greater chance of winning,"" said Cao, a lawyer and community activist. ""Based on the demographics of the district, a high voter turnout would have gone to our disadvantage."" Cao also may have been helped by the scandal that has plagued Jefferson. Jefferson, who pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal counts of racketeering, bribery, money laundering and obstruction of justice, denies any wrongdoing. In 2005, Jefferson's private homes in Washington and New Orleans were raided, and FBI agents say they found $90,000 in cash stashed in one of his freezers. Officials say the money was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on videotape. Jefferson also is accused of soliciting and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting their products and services to countries in Africa. Cao said he came to the United States at the age of 8 after his family fled Vietnam as it fell to communists. ""When I [was] 9 years old, I received a letter from my father while he was in the re-education camp,"" Cao said. ""He told me to study hard, to work hard and to give back to your country and to your community. So I hope to do that in Congress.""",1,7.072501819417798
3137f6c7ba1701318318d1646a9e0b04f867054b,CNN,"(CNN) -- With the latest reports of fake lists of dead veterans and alleged electronic coverups still going on at Phoenix Veterans Administration hospital, it's clear the disaster that has become the VA is just getting worse. So now more than ever, we have a duty to call on our leaders to right the wrongs we have found and prevent more from taking place. Our veterans, who survived hand grenades and bullets, are now facing a growing threat from three-ring binders and manila folders -- and a VA culture reluctant to measure, too slow to adapt and not responsive to their needs. To truly fix this problem, we must follow where the evidence takes us. For thousands of veterans in this country -- and those returning home from more than a decade at war -- the stakes could not be higher. The true cost of an antiquated system, slow technological upgrades, and the inability to track performance of the system itself can now be measured in thousands waiting far too long for care, and perhaps the tragic deaths of our brave heroes who may have waited too long for care. The next leader of the VA has a lengthy to-do list. After all, Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation did not reduce any backlogs or streamline the complex bureaucracy that exists and has harmed our veterans. And virtually all of those responsible for setting up and maintaining the culture of deception that has produced this scandal still have jobs. Until we can accurately measure and use information to evaluate what works and what doesn't -- and then address the problems our veterans face -- the rooms piled full of files and paperwork are not going anywhere, and veterans will continue to be neglected. The VA has had challenges under both Democratic and Republican administrations -- and if ever there was a bipartisan problem in need of bipartisan solutions, this is it. Here's where we should start: . 1. Improve the systems: We must continue to modernize the VA system through technology and data-driven approaches that demand results and make evaluation possible. The transition to electronic medical records is good, but not enough. 2. Collect and evaluate data: The backlog, and outdated and inaccurate tracking systems, fogged our ability to realize the scope of the problem and provide the care veterans deserve. The VA has an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and change their culture to one that tracks results and is responsive to the data they collect. American veterans deserve a system that meets the standard of excellence they set through their service. Collecting data from not only the investigations, but into the future as well will enable the VA to evaluate what is working and what needs more attention, funding or repair. 3. Meet the needs of veterans through smart deployment of resources: As a former chairman of the House Budget Committee and director of the Office of Management and Budget, I can safely say that throwing money at a problem hasn't and doesn't fix it -- and neither does blindly cutting funding. I am glad the VA was spared from sequestration cuts, as the VA has, despite funding increases, a classic problem of supply and demand. They have a lack of sufficient doctors and health care workers to meet the growing needs of all veterans, including aging vets and those returning from two protracted wars. The VA must now ask: What does the evidence in other health care systems tell us about how to efficiently meet the needs of veterans, while strengthening the quality of care and VA health system itself? Funding boosts for an antiquated system alone won't help, but looking at what works in other health delivery systems, as well successful public and market strategies will. 4. Establish strong leadership and bipartisan buy-in: A lengthy and political Senate confirmation process for Secretary Shinseki's replacement will do nothing for our veterans. What the VA needs now is strong leadership and bipartisan support for the next secretary which will give that individual a mandate to change the culture and fix the broken systems. 5. Listen to the customers: In business, there is no substitute for listening to the customers. The same goes for our nation's veterans. A nationally representative survey of veterans accessing the VA health care system should be conducted immediately to fully understand the depth and breadth of the problems they have faced beyond long waiting periods for their appointments. It will also give the new VA leadership some informative data. Together, we must get the facts, follow the evidence, listen to the veterans themselves, and we should use this as an opportunity for evidence-based, transformational change. We made a promise to our military members and their families. It is our duty to keep it. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",4,12.053913140745683

89cbae1e0f7540a04fdc70adbe6ca5f82c6ceb66,CNN,"(CNN) -- To get a sense of how Ron Paul is tying the GOP establishment in knots, look no further than Sen. Jim DeMint, the powerful Republican from the site of the next major primary, South Carolina. Until November 2010, DeMint had a clear claim on being the most influential, populist-flavored fiscal conservative in the Senate. Then a wave of Tea Party freshmen helped bring a Republican majority to the House of Representative and a new breed of politician to the Senate -- one best exemplified by Kentucky's Rand Paul, whose post-campaign memoir was titled The Tea Party Goes to Washington. DeMint, a strong social conservative, greeted it with both a hearty welcome (""[P]ut on your boxing gloves. The fight begins today"") and an attempt at line-drawing. ""You can't be a fiscal conservative,"" he claimed just after the election, ""and not be a social conservative."" DeMint was totally wrong about that -- polling data has indicated that a majority of Americans feel comfortable with the label of ""fiscally conservative and socially liberal"" -- but that's not what's interesting here. What's interesting is that after pooh-poohing the existence of a species that closely resembles the politically homeless tribe known as libertarians, DeMint, in the wake of Rep. Ron Paul's solid second-place showing so far in the GOP presidential primary season, is using the L-word as a compliment. ""One of the things that's hurt the so-called conservative alternative is saying negative things about Ron Paul,"" DeMint told radio host Laura Ingraham this week. ""I'd like to see a Republican Party that embraces a lot of the libertarian ideas."" This is a departure. In both 2000 and 2008, the top two GOP delegate-winners ran on explicitly anti-libertarian platforms. As John McCain wrote in his campaign memoir ""Worth the Fighting For,"" ""I welcomed a greater, if still limited, role for government in national problems, anathema to the 'leave us alone' libertarian philosophy that dominated Republican debates in the 1990s. So did George W. Bush, I must add, who challenged libertarian orthodoxy with his appeal for a 'compassionate conservatism.'"" The mix of compassionate conservatism, with its emphasis on domestic spending initiatives such as No Child Left Behind and the Medicare Part D, and neo-conservatism, with its emphasis on interventionist foreign policy, produced results that were both predictable and predictably repellent to libertarians: A 60% increase in federal nondefense spending under Bush, and a federal government that recognized no corner of the globe or hospital room as off-limits to American police power. It's no wonder, then, that libertarians, like the rest of America, have been fleeing the Republican Party in droves. From 1972 to1988, libertarians voted Republican for president 69 percent of the time; since then the percentage has dropped to 46. Meanwhile the country, and especially younger people, have been turning more culturally libertarian on issues like gay marriage and marijuana prohibition, at a time when the mainstream GOP keeps fighting those lost causes. Mitt Romney is on the glide path to the Republican nomination. But it is not escaping GOP notice that Romney's vote total in Iowa was the same as it was in 2008, and just 5 percentage points higher in New Hampshire than four years previous. Turnout among self-identified Republicans decreased in both states, even after more than three years of Barack Obama's misgovernance. Ron Paul, on the other hand, more than doubled his vote total in Iowa, and tripled it in New Hampshire, largely by attracting nearly half of all independents and young voters. Paul has gotten twice as many votes as Newt Gingrich so far. In the Granite State, he received more votes than Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry combined. And unlike Santorum and Gingrich (his two main competitors for the non-Romney slot at this point), Paul has a nationwide campaign, the ability to raise money at the drop of a hat, and the clear intention to compete all the way to the Republican National Convention. He is the clear front-runner in the race for second place. What are poor Republicans to do? Many of them hate Ron Paul's ideas on foreign policy, roll their eyes at his talk about the Federal Reserve, deem him to be several fries short of a Happy Meal, and -- correctly -- see his constitutional radicalism as a threat to both the philosophies behind compassionate conservatism and neo-conservatism, and to the practical gravy train of bipartisan big government. But he's the only Republican game in town when it comes to drawing in the independents and young voters they need. DeMint, for one, is making a partial accommodation, by saying nice things about Paul and refusing to endorse any candidate (though his staff is another story). ""I don't agree with Ron Paul on foreign policy and his disengagement around the world, but we're going to end up where he is because we don't have any money,"" DeMint told The Daily Caller. ""So the Republican Party needs to become the big tent of Americans who really want freedom, prosperity, opportunity and that's just synonymous with a more limited government."" But if the campaign comes down to a two-man race, you can expect some serious evictions from the GOP's shrinking tent. Buy popcorn.

It's called the ""Zombie"" virus because it transmits from phone to phone, just as in the movies, zombie bites turn people into the living dead. The virus binds with a security application, which then transmits the user's SIM card details to a central server controlled by a small group of hackers. The hackers then will send messages or make phone calls that contain virus-ridden links for games and software, said CCTV. Receivers who follow the link will find their phones infected, too, while at the same time providing a ""click through"" for the link itself, which typically translates into a payment for a party publicizing the links. CCTV said that the blame is likely to lay with intermediary distributors instead of the actual game or software developers that show up in the ads. Zhou Yonglin, an official with the National Computer Network Emergency Coordination Center, told CCTV that ""in the first week of September, nearly 1 million cell phones in the country were infected with the virus."" And although telecom providers are said to have taken steps to reduce the number of infected messages, Zou Shihong, a telecom expert at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, told CCTV that an updated virus might start sending fewer messages, making it harder for cell users to notice any suspicious activity.

Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six capital felony charges. The 12-member jury had recommended death by lethal injection on each of the counts. ""The task of sentencing another human being to death is the most sober and somber experience a judge can have,"" said Superior Court Judge Jon Blue.

You are now in God's hands."" The man convicted of being Komisarjevsky's accomplice, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in 2010. Juries convicted the pair on charges that they beat and tied up Dr. William Petit Jr., raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before trying to flee. Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters. ""I lost my family and my home,"" said Petit. ""My wife, my friend, my partner. I miss our late night chats and our partnership in raising the girls.""

She tweeted the pics as well as ""Legal in NYC but not on Instagram,"" and ""What @Instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple."" The New York Daily News reported that Willis launched her skin campaign after Instagram removed one of her photos it said violated its community guidelines. The picture reportedly included a sweatshirt that depicted two topless women with the nipples visible. The actress said Instagram removed her account, but she complained that other explicit photos -- including one with a woman hiding her nipples using a pair of handguns -- were allowed. ""Made a new Instagram, gonna post lots of beautiful photos of naked women I think. Tasteful, non aggressive, whomever wants to see can, if not,"" Willis tweeted before her topless walk. She also explained on Twitter the message she was hoping to spread. ""This is about helping women feel empowered to make personal choices about their bodies not dictated by what society says is decent,"" she tweeted. In New York City it is legal for a law-abiding woman to be topless in public.",1,11.932290823628446
b6e715b0d1016bfc61f6abda2d15eac23c3211cf,CNN,"(CNN) -- Tuesday was a tragic day for girls everywhere. In Pakistan, 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai was shot by the Taliban on her way home from school on a bus. Although she was targeted specifically because she spoke out against the Taliban's suppression of women's education rights, her story serves as a reminder of the obstacles that girls face in trying to obtain schooling. In all my travels, from Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to villages and towns across rural India, I have been struck by the unwavering commitment of every girl to do one simple thing: Go to school. Just like Malala, the girls I met know that education is their ticket to a better future: for themselves, their families and their entire communities. Girls would beg their parents to let them stay one more year in school, struggling to juggle their household chores with caring for their younger siblings, all so they can squeeze in one more day in the classroom. Unfortunately, girls around the world have also shared with me how pursuing an education can be dangerous, whether it's because of harassment and violence from teachers or the dangers they encounter as they walk to school. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . Today, as we celebrate the first United Nations International Day of the Girl by marking the progress that has been made for girls, we should keep in mind that we need to redouble our effort to create a future in which all girls can safely receive an education and reach their full potential. Violence keeps girls out of school. Globally, nearly half of all sexual assaults are committed against girls who are 15 and younger. Fear of this type of violence restricts where girls are allowed to go and when they are allowed to be out of the home. Often, parents do not send their daughters to school for this reason. Violence in the home can also hold girls captive and out of school. For instance, nearly half the girls in developing countries are married during their teenage years, with many before age 15. They may experience profound violence at the hands of their often much older husbands. But sadly, school does not equal safety. Even girls who are able to go to school still face violence -- in the classroom, of all places. A girl may walk up to five kilometers between home and school in the company of friends or an older brother to avoid the inevitable harassment by groups of men or boys she passes, only to receive more harassment from a teacher once she finally reaches school. In schools around the world, teachers pressure girls for sex in exchange for grades. In Zambia, for example, more than 2,000 cases of teacher rapes were reported in 2010 alone. Of these cases, only 240 teachers were convicted. While these numbers may be shocking, Zambia is not the only country with this problem. Schools should be a safe haven for girls, but instead, they are too often a place of fear and danger. International day of the girl: World's most remarkable women share advice . However, despite the violence that can happen in schools, going to school tends to increase girls' safety outside school. A recent study in Swaziland found that the risk of childhood sexual violence was greatest among those who were not attending school, suggesting that greater educational opportunities decrease vulnerability to violence. Girls in school have an opportunity to escape early marriage and early motherhood, and to gain skills that give them enhanced economic and social opportunities. As part of the global community, we can all do our part to help girls by making school safe and making sure they can get to school. Here are a few ways: . -- Invest directly in girls. Less than 2% of every international development dollar goes directly to adolescent girls, let alone toward protecting them from violence. We have made great strides globally in increasing the numbers of girls in primary school, but until we make girls' safety a priority we will not advance our educational goals. -- Ensure schools are accountable to girls by enacting and enforcing policies that prevent sexual abuse and exploitation by teachers. When a 13-year-old girl in Zambia was repeatedly raped by her teacher, the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund supported the girl's court case against the teacher who raped her and the headmaster who knowingly allowed the assaults to occur. In 2008, the High Court of Zambia ruled that the Zambian government is responsible for protecting girls from sexual assault and providing recourse to victims. Schools everywhere must enact systems that protect girls and hold teachers accountable. -- Empower schools and girls through provision of safe spaces. One important outcome of the Zambian teacher rape case has been the wide scale adoption of safe spaces for girls in Zambian schools. -- Recruit, train and retain female teachers. Female teachers can reduce some of the major risks adolescent girls face in school. They can also serve as strong role models and help girls imagine different futures for themselves. The 10x10 Campaign is uniting people and organizations around the critical goal of removing barriers to girls' education. Likewise, so is the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund. You can join them. The benefits of education for girls are undeniable. But until we can ensure that schools are places of learning, rather than places of danger, girls will be held back. When girls are educatedâ€”and safeâ€”they, along with our entire societies, will flourish. On CNN iReport, tet us know why educating girls is #basicmath .

069b8f4df75169101d5d6ed4e70fb89e1335345d,CNN,"(CNN) -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners. ""We have been able to talk with the miners. Their spirits are quite high,"" President Ollanta Humala told reporters outside the mine. But more work needs to be done before the rescue begins, Humala said. Engineers were working to make sure the mine was secure ""so there are no victims,"" he said. ""Those same engineers tell us that we have to wait a few hours. They haven't said how many,"" the president said. The miners have been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. Earlier Tuesday, one of the mining engineers in charge of the rescue declined to give a specific time frame for the operation. ""We can't say how long it will take right now to get them out, but I can guarantee that they are alive, that they are in good health, and that ultimately they are going to be freed alive,"" engineer Carlos Bejarano said. A cave-in over the weekend complicated efforts. ""It's very complicated work. We're taking into account all the necessary security measures to avoid risks among the rescuers themselves,"" said Cesar Chonate, a regional head of Peru's civil defense agency, the state-run Andina news agency reported. Video from state-run TV Peru showed workers, wearing hard hats and headlamps, loading rocks into a pushcart by hand. It was not clear what caused the initial collapse. The miners have been getting oxygen, food and water through a tube, which has also allowed them to stay in contact with people above ground, Andina reported. Peruvian Mining Minister Jorge Merino was also in the area and appealed to mining companies for their expertise, according to a statement from his office. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals. ""The important thing is that the nine people are alive. We won't abandon them,"" Merino said. The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days. All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.",2,8.708138608493531
b5b12bf93e563d560ad68ff6f59b49da2cf19bf9,CNN,"(CNN) -- NASA has never flown a manned space shuttle mission. There was no Mars rover. People can make their own currency. From February 2009 through September 2010, someone using the name ""Erad3"" made these and a series of other assertions -- unusual at best, disturbed at worst -- on the website abovetopsecret.com. Erad3, according to site co-owner Mark Allin, was almost certainly Jared Lee Loughner, the 22-year-old man accused of killing six people and injuring 14 others last weekend, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. The site, Allin said, focuses on ""alternative news"" and information ""not covered by the mainstream media."" Allin noted that all 130 messages from Erad3 were posted from Loughner's hometown of Tucson, and many of them bear a striking resemblance to postings made by Loughner on the popular social media site YouTube. Investigators are examining the postings on Allin's site, according to a law enforcement source. The messages from Erad3 -- riddled with grammatical errors -- often became the object of ridicule, scorn or sympathy from other contributors. ""The ranting about proof, (your) inability to make a coherent sentence gives you away red handed,"" one person wrote. ""It won't be long (until) you have been banned once again!"" ""You sound absolutely bonkers,"" added another. ""I think you're frankly schizophrenic,"" said a third. ""That's not an amateur opinion and not intended as an uninformed or insulting. ... You clearly make no sense and are unable to communicate. I really do care. Seek help before you hurt yourself or others or start taking your medications again, please."" Erad3 replied with a series of unrelated arguments before concluding with a brief expression of thanks for the writer's concern. None of Erad3's postings mentions Giffords or a desire for violence, unlike language used in documents found in Loughner's residence. They do, however, appear to reflect a strong urge to break free of any constraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials. ""Every human who's mentally capable is always able to be treasurer of their new currency,"" he wrote at one point. ""If the treasury creates one new currency then why couldn't they create an infinite amount? Wouldn't (it) be beautiful to see your face on the new coins?"" The investigation into the postings is part of a pledge from law enforcement authorities to pursue every lead relating to Saturday's shooting.

756e85abc196765275a2c63678056c50ad30c789,CNN,"(CNN) -- The Ivory Coast have reportedly sacked coach Vahid Halilhodzic despite the Bosnian having guided the African team to this year's World Cup finals. Russia coach Guus Hiddink is among the favorites to take over for football's showpiece tournament starting in June, according to a report from the British Press Association which was carried on the Web site of world ruling body FIFA on Saturday. It said the 57-year-old Halihodzic, who took charge in 2008, had been axed after the Ivorians failed to live up to their favorite status at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola last month and lost in the quarterfinals to Algeria. ""This Saturday I brought Vahid Halilhodzic's contract to an end because one of the aims that was set for him was not reached and that was to win the 2010 African Nations Cup,"" Cote d'Ivoire football federation president Jacques Anouma reportedly said on national television. Hiddink's contract with Russia expires on June 30, two weeks after the finals start, and he has a free period before taking over the reigns with Turkey in August. The Dutchman was also linked with the vacant Nigeria coaching role, which subsequently went to former Sweden manager Lars Lagerback, who signed a five-month contract on Friday. Hiddink recently revealed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who played for him in a brief spell while coaching English club Chelsea, had sounded him out about taking the job. ""The interest from Ivory Coast is real, but first I have to analyze the situation,"" Hiddink said. ""I need to solve some matters before making my decision. ""Drogba asked me in the name of the players to accept the invitation. The Ivorian federation is also very interested.""",7,5.7485448236748855
51f81627cd93e68f5a03f380e5d26034aa5f95c5,CNN,"(CNN) -- Deadly explosions rocked parts of Damascus on Saturday with some of the targets being Syrian government facilities, witnesses and state television reported. At least 27 people were killed and 97 others were wounded in two blasts, state TV reported, quoting Syrian Health Minister Wael Halki. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said early indications were that two booby-trapped cars exploded in crowded areas. It put the death toll at 24, with 140 people injured and serious damage caused to surrounding buildings. One explosion occurred near the customs criminal investigations department, witnesses said. Another struck near the Air Force intelligence headquarters in Tahrir Square in a different area of the city. State TV reports blamed the explosions on ""terrorists."" The explosion by the customs criminal investigations department was only a short distance from Umayyad Square, where state media reported Friday that huge numbers turned out to demonstrate in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The blast near the Air Force intelligence headquarters was close to where twin bombings struck the offices of two security branches in Damascus in December. The government blamed terrorists inside and outside of Syria, but the opposition called the attacks the work of the regime. The capital was hit by another blast in January. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria, an opposition activist network, reported seeing a large white cloud of smoke hanging above Damascus Friday. Twenty-two people were killed elsewhere in Syria Saturday, the LCC said, including a child, two military defectors and two people under torture. The child, 11, died in the city of Raqqa when security forces fired on a funeral procession, the LCC said. Eight other deaths occurred in Raqqa and five in Homs, the LCC said, with others reported in Jabal al-Zawiyah, the town of Tremseh, in Hama province, and Inkhel, in Daraa province. Opposition activists also spoke about the aftermath of an attack in the Rifai district of Homs province this week, in which they said at least 32 children and two women were found, most of them injured. ""The children were tortured -- beaten, abused, fingers cut off, and shot by thugs,"" said Waleed Faris. Faris is a pseudonym. An activist identified only as Abu Faris was part of a rescue operation in Rifai. He described seeing abandoned neighborhoods, ""tens of bodies"" and ""horrific corpses, shot, mutilated -- everywhere."" The latest violence comes a day after Kofi Annan, special joint U.N-Arab League envoy, briefed the U.N. Security Council Friday on the Syrian crisis via a private teleconference. Speaking to reporters afterward from Geneva, Annan said he was working hard to stop the yearlong violence in Syria and ""get unimpeded access"" for humanitarian relief. ""I'm doing my best with the support of everyone to try to find a peaceful solution,"" Annan said. ""The Syrian people want to get on with their lives. They are tired and they suffered a lot."" He said U.N. humanitarian agencies are to arrive in Syria this weekend ""if they are not there already, to start their mission with the Syrian government."" The former U.N. secretary-general said the situation in Syria is ""much more complex"" than that in Libya or other nations. ""It's a conflict in a region of the world that has seen many, many traumatic events. I think we need to handle the situation in Syria very, very carefully,"" he said. ""Any miscalculation that leads to major escalation will have impact in the region."" Asked about the prospects of a coalition government, Annan said such a development would have to emerge from talks among Syrians. U.N. Security Council members are backing Annan's efforts, said Mark Lyall Grant, the British ambassador to the United Nations and the current council president. Grant didn't disclose details about the meeting but told reporters the session was ""comprehensive."" Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, also told reporters that ""Syria is committed to making Mr. Annan's mission successful."" Annan met last weekend with the Syrian president in Damascus and the Syrian opposition in Turkey in an effort to end the violence that has swept the nation since Syrian security forces cracked down on protesters a year ago. He described the atmosphere in the talks as ""welcoming and correct."" Most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. But al-Assad's regime has said ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria and says it has popular support for its actions. The Syrian government Friday underscored its position on terror in letters to top U.N. officials, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It said it was protecting its citizens from ""terrorists"" who are slaughtering and murdering ""innocent citizens."" The government said Syria is working to find a political solution to the crisis and wants to cooperate with Annan. More than 8,000 people have died in the conflict, according to the United Nations, but opposition activists say the overall toll is more than 9,000, most of them civilians.

e2d298fcc269ecdb58d94fae443e157079115e5c,CNN,"(CNN) -- The United Nations plans to add 2,000 more soldiers to its peacekeeping mission in the Ivory Coast amid escalating violence between supporters of rival politicians. Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent leader, is defying calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost the election in November. The international community -- including the United Nations -- considers challenger Alassane Ouattara the winner of the presidential vote. Ouattara is holed up in a hotel in the main city of Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers . Reinforcements will also include three more armed helicopters to help protect civilians, according to a spokesman. ""These helicopters will be used to promote peace and provide protection,"" said Hamadoun Toure, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in the country. The 9,000-strong mission has been in the country for seven years, according to the United Nations. World leaders are concerned that violence from the standoff will cause another civil war, which split the country into a rebel-held north and a government-controlled south in 2002. Last week, at least six were killed when an all-women group protesting the disputed president's refusal to cede power was fired upon. Gbagbo soldiers attacked the group, which was peacefully marching in Abidjan on Thursday, said P.J. Crowley, the U.S. State Department spokesman. Video footage shows women screaming as thunderous gunshots are heard in the background. After the attack, bloodied bodies, flip-flops and tote bags were left scattered on the streets. The disputed president denied his forces were behind the killings, calling it a ""gross manipulation"" of events . About 365 people have been killed since the standoff started in December, the U.N. said. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes, with about 200,000 leaving the Abidjan area alone since the clashes started. The United Nations refugee agency has warned that its access to people in need of urgent humanitarian aid is becoming impossible amid escalating violence.",3,8.047310650741025
8655a6114977db5566b26bd13bf4562aca7a218e,CNN,"(CNN) -- A wildfire that has raged for days in Michigan's Upper Peninsula has destroyed 97 structures -- including a motel, a store and 34 homes. The Duck Lake Fire has burned more than 22,000 acres and is still going despite recent rains, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources reported on its website. The state agency estimated Monday the blaze is about 51% contained, thanks to progress made by firefighters in maintaining a firm perimeter. Crews have about 40 miles of firelines set up to control the situation, including 6 miles along the shore of Lake Superior. But a lack of roads in the area has complicated efforts. The fire's south end is about 14 miles north of Newberry and 7 miles west of the Yahquamenon Falls State Park campgrounds. Lightning sparked the wildfire late Wednesday afternoon, leaving firefighters little time to contain it before dark. The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures. Since then, the wildfire has taken its toll. While noting that the entire affected area has not been surveyed, the state department said at least 97 structures on 39 different properties have been ""lost"" due to the blaze. Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.",2,8.734845487624078
fa8d41eacd49716df89d2c94430e0eecbb4db139,CNN,"(CNN) -- Refugees at a settlement in southwestern Uganda have barricaded all roads into the camp to protest a food-aid disruption they say has caused the deaths of several children, refugee leaders said Tuesday. ""We have spent three months without any food supplies from government nor from any food relief or humanitarian agency,"" Congolese refugee leader Serugendo Sekalinda said by telephone. The protest began Tuesday after the deaths of three children Monday night, refugees said. Those were the latest of dozens of children who have died in the past two weeks due to hunger, refugee leaders said. But Needa Jehu Hoyah, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, known as the UNHCR, told CNN by telephone from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, that no children have died in the Nakivale settlement, which has tens of thousands of refugees. ""We have a malnutrition program [in Nakivale] for children, [but] no children have died of hunger there,"" she said. The UNHCR, along with the U.N.'s World Food Program and the Ugandan government, will deliver a food shipment to the settlement Wednesday, Hoyah said. Uganda's disaster preparedness and refugees minister, professor Tarsis Kabwejyere, told CNN that the refugees living in that camp -- most of whom fled fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- would have their full rations Wednesday. For a time they've been getting half rations, he said. ""By tomorrow there will be no food crisis at that settlement,"" Kabwejyere said. ""We do our best to make sure humanity survives, even in the hardships in refugee settlements, so people have a reasonable existence."" The food shortage came about as a result of a disruption in the food supply chain and a shortage of money for food, the minister said. Hoyah agreed that there ""were issues with the food pipeline."" Protesters at the Nakivale settlement, about 400 kilometers (248 miles) southwest of Kampala and 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the Ugandan border with Tanzania, gathered at the homes where the most recent deaths of children have occurred, Sekalinda said. ""We are demanding to be relocated to another country where we can be protected from death caused by hunger,"" he said. While the settlement's population is composed mainly of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, it also houses refugees from conflicts in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea and Kenya. Nakivale is the largest and oldest of the five refugee settlements in Uganda, having opened more than two decades ago. People living there are provided small plots of land on which to grow crops, and they often build huts made of mud, water and thatched grass. As many as 155,000 refugees live in all the camps in Uganda, according to the UNHCR. As of January of this year, there were also an estimated 853,000 internally displaced persons, or IDPs, the UNHCR says on its Web site. The IDPs were forced from their villages in the past decade by attacks from the Lord's Resistance Army, which wants to create a democratic government in Uganda based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. Last week, an African Union summit in Kampala endorsed a declaration to end the forceful displacement of people in all of Africa. Delegates to the poorly attended summit also pledged to aid refugees and IDPs by training them in vocational skills so they could find work during and after their forced displacement.

Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program. ""I have no excuse for what I have done. I have let down our country,"" he said at a news conference Wednesday night, hours after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine. He said he will donate his salary to charity while he's away. Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to Fort Myers, Florida, Wednesday night. Earlier in the day, he was in a Washington, D.C. courtroom answering to the misdemeanor charge. He was sentenced to a year of probation. ""I will be going into treatment, and I'm going to start with intensive, in-patient treatment,"" Radel said. ""That's what's next for me. I have already begun the process. Sometimes in life you need a wake-up call. This is my wake-up call."" During the brief news conference, the 37-year-old, first-term Republican from Florida said he ""grew up with a mom who struggled with alcoholism."" ""I don't want my son to struggle with that,"" he said. Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife. ""My wife is my rock, and she has been so supportive through this,"" he said. ""I have to mend her heart which I've broken, and I've broken a lot of hearts."" The hearing . The plea and sentence were part of a deal that Radel's attorney struck with federal prosecutors. He could have received a maximum sentence of 180 days imprisonment or a $1,000 fine, or both. Instead, he was placed on one year probation, and if it is ""successfully completed,"" his guilty plea will be cleared from his record. ""Your honor, I apologize for what I've done,"" Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday. ""I think in life I've hit a bottom where I realize I need help."" Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones. The sting . He was charged after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover police officer in Washington's Dupont Circle area on October 29, court documents say. Who is Trey Radel? It was a sting that stemmed from a broader FBI/Drug Enforcement Administration investigation of a drug trafficking organization in the nation's capital, law enforcement officials told CNN on condition of anonymity. The targets of the investigation are dealers and high-level people in the organization, not buyers and users. But a dealer who was arrested last month told federal agents that one of his customers was a congressman, one of the law enforcement officials said. So, deciding they couldn't turn away from that, agents set up the sting, the law enforcement officials said. The admission . Court documents say Radel gave the undercover officer $260 for the cocaine outside a restaurant, and the two got into the officer's vehicle, where the officer gave Radel the cocaine. Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents. Radel then agreed to talk to the agents in his apartment, where he admitted he bought cocaine, according to the documents. ""The defendant also retrieved and provided to the agents a vial of cocaine that he had in his apartment,"" the court documents say. The background . A tea party favorite, Radel was elected last year to represent southwest Florida's 19th Congressional District. He is a former journalist and TV news anchor, having worked for WINK in Fort Myers, Florida. He also owned and eventually sold the Naples Journal newspaper, according to a biography on his congressional website. Radel is married with a young son. He is active on Twitter, where he posts about touring the Capitol, listening to hip-hop, playing guitar and opposing Obamacare. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said in a prepared statement this week that members of Congress ""should be held to the highest standards, and the alleged crime will be handled by the courts."" ""Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents,"" Boehner's spokesman said.

12a2f3e8d55a4abbc443defee8e635c4925a8b85,CNN,"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's open conflict with U.S. President Barack Obama over his diplomacy with Iran has not only served a blow to the U.S.-Israeli relationship. It has also collapsed Israel's otherwise arguably successful Iran policy. Contrary to Israel's rhetoric, the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s. Obviously, Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for Israel. But that has not been Israel's primary concern. Rather, the fear has been that Washington would end up finding a compromise with Iran that on the one hand would close off any Iranian path to a bomb, but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in Israel's disfavor. Regardless of the details of a nuclear deal with Iran, a deal per se would reduce Washington's tensions with Tehran, while not necessarily tempering the Israeli-Iranian rivalry proportionally. Israel will be ""abandoned"" to face Iran alone, Israelis fear. Moreover, a deal would signal, the argument goes, that Washington has accepted and will not contest Iran's geopolitical advances in the region. Iran has hegemonic aspirations, Israel contends, and must be stopped, not accommodated. After a deal with Iran, Washington would be even more likely to shift its geopolitical focus elsewhere and be less intertwined with Israel's needs. The U.S.-Iran enmity has ensured Washington's commitment to isolating and containing Iran, much to Israel's satisfaction. If your interest dictates that the U.S. and Iran must remain firmly at odds with each other, a nuclear deal -- any deal -- would eliminate the most explosive point of contention between Washington and Tehran and lessen America's inclination to confront Iran on other matters, Israel believes. As Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said earlier this week: ""[E]very deal that will be signed between the West and this messianic and apocalyptic regime will strike a severe blow to Western and Israeli interests."" This also explains why Netanyahu has been contradicting his own intelligence services and exaggerated and misconstrued Iran's nuclear activities. Israel's policy towards Iran and the nuclear issue in the past two decades has rested on a few principles. First, consecutive Israeli governments have been on the forefront of sounding the alarm about Iran, while carefully avoiding making Iran an ""Israeli issue."" At times, Israel has tried to tone down its rhetoric, both to avoid making the nuclear file an Israeli issue, but also to avoid making Israel shine too bright on the Iranian threat radar. When Netanyahu was first elected prime minister, he requested an intelligence assessment of Israel's security environment. The debate was largely on whether Iran or Iraq constituted Israel's greatest external threat. Netanyahu decided to go with the assessment of the Mossad, presented by Uzi Arad, who argued that Israel could either make itself Iran's prime enemy by continuing belligerent rhetoric against Tehran, or it could tone things down and let Iran focus on other threats. ""Until the Netanyahu government, there was a proliferation of Israeli statements trying to deter Iran, warning Iran, the long arm of the Israeli air force etc. That was stopped, to his credit, by Netanyahu,"" Israeli journalist Ehud Yaari told me in an interview for my book Treacherous Alliance - the Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran and the US. Ultimately, Israel was successful at turning the world's focus towards Iran's nuclear activities. The international community, led by Washington, began regarding Iran's nuclear issue as a primary threat to international security, imposed U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and the U.S. even openly debated bombing the country. But over the course of the past 18 months, the Netanyahu government has made Iran all about Israel. While virtually the entire world is eager for a peaceful nuclear deal, Israel stands alone (bar a few Arab states in the Persian Gulf) in opposing the talks. While Israel helped shape international consensus about Iran's nuclear program in the years past, Israel is today decisively outside of that consensus. Second, while Israel calculated that preventing a U.S.-Iran deal would best serve its interest, it needed to retain the flexibility to shift its position if and when an agreement was likely to be reached. By adopting a more cooperative tone with Washington, Israel's flexibility would enable it to influence the deal and reduce its potential downsides for Israel. For instance, when U.S. President Bill Clinton started sending strong signals to Iran's newly elected reformist president Mohammad Khatami in the late 1990s, then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak softened Israel's tone towards Iran in order to minimize any negative side-effects of a U.S.-Iran deal for Israel. He symbolically reduced Iran from ""enemy"" to ""threat,"" signaling that he didn't see Israeli-Iranian enmity as inevitable. Clinton's outreach to Iran never bore fruit, so Israel never had to deal with its potential repercussions. But Barak signaled his openness and ability to adjust to such a scenario, recognizing that Israel's most important relationship after all was that with United States. But this flexibility has been completely abandoned or lost under Netanyahu's leadership. Ever since Obama took office, Netanyahu has actively sought to first prevent diplomacy, then undermine diplomacy to his current stance of building up opposition to Obama's prospective deal with Tehran. Netanyahu has taken it to an extreme. He has been so disruptive that the Obama administration has felt compelled to reduce information sharing about the negotiations with his government, lest he would leak it to undercut the talks. The more Netanyahu has sought to undermine the talks, the more Israel has lost its ability to impact the negotiations. By now, Netanyahu has crossed the real ""point of no return."" Confidence in him is completely lost in the White House, so he cannot adopt Ehud Barak's posture. His only remaining options is to double down on opposing a nuclear deal with Iran, even at the cost of an open war with the American president, of damaging U.S.-Israel relations beyond Obama, and of making Israel a partisan issue. Such is the logic of adopting extremist positions. Rather than depriving the other side of options and maneuverability, Netanyahu has painted Israel in a corner.",7,10.231809378993583
a05b9e9354e94803ada86080f76236cb29b68cce,CNN,"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela spent almost three decades in jail, but he wasn't alone -- he had two Indian goddesses and a 17th century playwright for company. Locked in solitary confinement on Robben Island, newspapers were banned and letters from loved ones a rare treat. Where did he find the inspiration to continue his long struggle for freedom? As the twittersphere explodes with quotes from the legendary leader, it's perhaps easy to forget there was a time when Mandela was in need of a few words of wisdom himself. He found them in the musings of another great thinker -- one born centuries before and on the other side of the world. A tattered book covered in luminous Hindu deities might have seemed like a strange choice for the South African political activist languishing in his cell. But the beatifically smiling women on the cover knew something the prison wardens didn't. Inside was the ""Complete Works of Shakespeare,"" and the historic text became a source of strength for Mandela and his fellow inmates during their darkest days. A bible by any other name . It became known as the ""Robben Island Bible,"" and today is one of the most remarkable artifacts from Mandela's 27 years in jail. ""What resonance does a white guy from England 400 years ago have to a group of South African political prisoners in the latter half of the 20th century?"" said Matthew Hahn, who wrote a play based on the ""Robben Island Bible,"" and interviewed many of the inmates who read it. ""There's this universality to Shakespeare -- including many lessons on good and bad leadership -- and I think Mandela found resonance in his words. He once said that 'To be taken seriously as a politician, one must always quote from Shakespeare,' and a lot of his speeches when he was president did just that."" The valiant . The book was smuggled into the jail by political prisoner Sonny Venkatrathnam, who disguised it in colorful Diwali cards celebrating the Hindu festival of lights, convincing the warden it was his bible. Between 1975 and 1978, the volume was passed between 33 of Venkatrathnam's fellow prisoners -- including Mandela. Many of the inmates signed and dated their names beside particularly poignant passages -- words of hardship, political unrest, or injustice. Mandela chose a passage from Julius Caesar -- just before the Roman statesman leaves for the senate on the Ides of March -- and his sweeping handwriting on the now-yellowing page is a haunting reminder of the activist's dedication to his cause. It includes the lines: ""Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once."" ""I believe when Nelson Mandela signed this passage, he recognized this book would get out and be circulated in the liberation movement -- his would be the quote people looked to,"" said Hahn. ""It was an incredibly powerful quote -- he lived his entire life according to these two lines."" Lasting impression . The quote is all the more poignant considering Mandela's speech during the 1960s Rivonia Trial, where he said: ""If need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Mandela signed the passage December 16, 1977. He never could have imagined that December 16 would later be known as ""Reconciliation Day"" in South Africa -- a public holiday which only came into effect after the fall of apartheid. While Hahn believes the ""Robben Island Bible"" began as an attempt by Venkatrathnam to gain the autographs of the most famous political activists at the time, it has now become a powerful memento of their many years -- and sources of inspiration -- behind bars. ""It was amazing to see visitors from all over the world drawn to this book like a magnet,"" said Jonathan Bate, Professor of English Literature at Oxford University, who helped curate the British Museum's Shakespeare exhibition last year. ""It was a coming together of one of the greatest writers of humanity, and one of the greatest humans of the 20th century. With Mandela's death comes a particular poignancy in a passage referring to the death of the valiant.""",1,6.519326575280984
bad16608409d4e203fad17f405707df2a8464a11,CNN,"(CNN) -- English Premier League strugglers West Bromwich Albion have sacked manager Roberto di Matteo following a poor run of recent results. The 40-year-old former Italian international led Albion to promotion from the Championship last season, his first at the club. And they continued that good form into the start of the current campaign, notably winning 3-2 at Arsenal and earning a 2-2 draw at Manchester United -- the only team to avoid defeat at Old Trafford this season. Their start to the season was so impressive that Di Matteo won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for September. However, results have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks, and di Matteo was relieved of his duties following Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City which left them just one place above the relegation zone in 16th place. A statement on the official club website read: ""West Bromwich Albion have relieved head coach Roberto di Matteo of his duties with immediate effect. ""This was the unanimous decision of the football club's board of directors in light of a worrying sequence of results which has seen the club lose 13 of their last 18 games in all competitions, winning only three. ""First-team coach Michael Appleton will assume control of first-team affairs whilst the club considers all available options for a new head coach."" Club chairman Jeremy Peace added: ""This has been a tough decision, but we, as a board, believe it is the right one to give the club the best possible chance of remaining in the Premier League this decision.""",7,9.475493809605995
f27ee0ca2728db04f5e0fb8f79f8544caab884e6,CNN,"(CNN) -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, who had a storied career in professional football as a coach, commissioner and owner, died Saturday, the team said. He was 82. In a brief post on their website, the Raiders said a statement would be issued later in the day. The cause of death was not immediately released. Much of Davis' career was spent in Oakland, where he first arrived as a coach in 1963 -- tasked with turning around a team that was picked to be at the bottom of the standings. The results were almost immediate, finishing 10-4 that season, and Davis was selected as coach of the year. At 33, he was both the coach and general manager of the Raiders, the website said, making him the youngest person to hold that dual position. His career started in 1950 as a line coach at Adelphi College in New York, the Raiders website said. He also coached at The Citadel, Southern California and for the then-Los Angeles Chargers before going to the Raiders. According to the Raiders website, by the time he arrived in Oakland, Davis had already been labeled a ""young coaching genius"" by Sports Illustrated. As commissioner of the American Football League in 1966, he played a role in the merger of that league with the National Football League. Davis' story, the Raiders website said, ""is a standard that no one in the history of professional football can match for winning and excellence."" He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 1992. ""Al Davis's passion for football and his influence on the game were extraordinary,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on his Twitter account. ""The respect he commanded was evident in the way that people listened carefully every time he spoke. He is a true legend of the game whose impact and legacy will forever be part of the NFL."" New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson also shared his sympathy on the news of Davis' death. ""Al Davis was one of the most innovative and dynamic pioneers in the history of the National Football League. He was passionate about his team and about the game of professional football and he personified the legacy of the Raiders,"" he said.",1,10.418097165802708
3a5bca04abc988e980fc4a61638d136d8659b63f,CNN,"(CNN) -- The bad news came via certified letter to Norma Jimenez, Edna Rodriguez and nearly 17,000 other Puerto Ricans this month. Thousands last week protest government layoffs in Puerto Rico. To cut spending, Puerto Rico announced last month that thousands of government employees would be fired in the second round of layoffs this year. More than 7,800 public employees were fired in March. ""I was fearful because of the uncertainty,"" Jimenez, 42, an auxiliary administrator for the U.S. territory's Department of Education told CNN. ""Will the letter come or not come?"" The letter came, and it said that under a measure authorized by an emergency fiscal bill, her last day of work would be January 8 of next year. Rodriguez, who worked for the education department for 11 years as a receptionist, got the same letter, but with a November 6 termination date. ""It was as if the world collapsed,"" she told CNN. And presumably, so it goes for the thousands of other public employees who were laid off. The austere measures are a bid by the government to stabilize a fiscal mess and save Puerto Rico's credit rating. According to government figures, the U.S. territory faces a $3.2 billion budget deficit -- proportionally, the largest shortfall in the United States -- and is entering a fourth year of recession. The severity of the plan reflects the aftermath of what experts say is years, maybe decades, of the lack of a forward-looking economic policy. Confronted with the fear that the credit-rating agencies might reduce Puerto Rico's rating to junk status, the administration of Gov. Luis Fortuno has taken strong, but controversial, steps. ""Every layoff letter has a name, and every name has a story,"" Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said in an interview with CNN. But, he said, ""Doing nothing was not an alternative."" The governor and other officials cut their salaries and trimmed spending in other areas, but the massive layoffs were necessary to avert the downgraded credit rating, McClintock said. ""If that happened, we would become the first state in the history of the U.S. to have its credit downgraded to junk bond,"" he said. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate is nearly 16 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to government calculations, a downgraded credit rating would have pushed that figure toward 25 percent unemployment, McClintock said. The government is betting that the reduced spending, combined with $6.5 billion in combined federal and local stimulus funds, will be enough to get the territory back on solid footing. As a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico exercises much autonomy, but still falls under U.S. jurisdiction. In addition to the federal stimulus money, Puerto Rican officials traveled to Washington last month to lobby for discretionary stimulus grants. How did Puerto Rico get into this predicament? ""This did not happen overnight,"" said Miguel Soto-Class, executive director of the Center for the New Economy, an independent think tank in Puerto Rico. For too long, the island has been dependent on a single industry at a time, Soto-Class told CNN. First it was coffee, then sugar, and most recently pharmaceutical production plants. Under the terms of a special tax break, U.S. companies were exempt from paying federal income tax on profits earned by their Puerto Rican manufacturing subsidiaries. This brought plenty of companies and jobs to the island until Congress voted to phase out the benefits between 1996 and 2006. When a number of foreign companies began to pull back, Puerto Rico saw that the local economy had not absorbed many benefits from the foreign plants, Soto-Class said. For instance, local restaurants didn't sprout near the plants because food was usually done in-house. Likewise, the foreign companies used their own accountants, leaving local CPAs few opportunities to grow. ""That wasn't the cause, but it laid bare that we hadn't had an economic development model in a long time,"" Soto-Class said. On the fiscal front, most the attention has focused on the large public workforce. With a workforce of some 200,000, Puerto Rico, with a population of about 4 million, has more public employees than any state in the union, with the exception of California and New York, McClintock said. For comparison, California has about one state employee for every 103 residents, while Puerto Rico has one public worker for every 20 residents. The public payroll had become bloated, he said. Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, said that a large public workforce is not a bad thing, as long as it adds and keeps up to the territory's growth. But even when Puerto Rico's economy started declining, the public sector continued to swell. The territory's political parties had become dependent on government employment as a political tool, in effect creating a patronage system, Melendez said. ""We are where we are because the patronage system is bankrupt,"" he said. For Fortuno, a member of Puerto Rico's pro-statehood New Progressive Party and also member of the Republican Party, the challenges required immediate action. ""You can bring it down to a four word phrase: 'No pain, no gain,' "" McClintock said. The government has already spent more than $1 billion in stimulus funds that have created some 10,000 private sector jobs, he said. ""That's why we are stimulating the private sector to grow, so that it can pick up the slack that the government can no longer afford to employ on its own,"" McClintock said. Thousands of protesters who participated in a strike last week dispute that firing this many workers during a recession will help the territory. ""This worsens the situation by increasing unemployment,"" Roberto Pagan, president of the Puerto Rico Worker's Union, told CNN. ""We want the government to take alternative measures."" The government's bet is that the negative impact of the laid off workers will be offset with positive effects of the stimulus funds, Soto-Class said. It's a risky bet, he said, adding that the Fortuno administration grasps the economics of the situation very well. Looking to the future, McClintock said the government expects to balance the budget in two years. Soto-Class said that recovery will also mean looking at diversifying the economic activity. Tourism and agriculture, for example, could become larger factors in the economy, he said. Pagan, the union leader, said he supports levying higher corporate taxes to increase revenue. The government, however, said it plans to continue to use tax incentives to lure companies to the island. Puerto Rico is ""still the pharmaceutical capital of the world, but we have to try to manufacture even more Tylenol to resolve our economic headaches,"" McClintock said. ""We have to manufacture even more Viagra than we already manufacture so our economic statistics will rise.""",5,10.408503069805857
b6da14543e5640a2c2ce19251d6a8426f84429e1,CNN,"(CNN) -- Three men who were convicted of killing three Cub Scouts 16 years ago will have their cases reviewed in a court hearing to see whether they should be granted a new trial, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley were convicted in the 1993 deaths of 8-year-olds Michael Moore, Christopher Byers and Steven Branch. The boys' bruised and mutilated bodies were found in May 1993 in West Memphis, Arkansas, their arms and legs hogtied with their own shoelaces. The court Thursday remanded the cases back to the lower court. The ruling means Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley will be able to present new evidence that could exonerate them. Echols' attorneys said at a hearing in September that they want to present DNA evidence not available at the time of the trial, as well as testimony that supports arguments that Echols and the two others are innocent. ""We are very pleased that the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered a new evidentiary hearing to review the convincing evidence of the innocence of Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley,"" Echols spokesman Lonnie Soury said. ""These young men were convicted of a brutal crime someone else committed, and we hope the state moves quickly to overturn their convictions and seek to prosecute those responsible."" The case, known as the West Memphis 3, has gained advocates including some of the victims' parents. Pamela Hobbs, Branch's mother, said last year that she was once convinced of their guilt but began to consider the DNA evidence and believes the prosecution's case was flawed. ""We are asking the Arkansas Supreme Court to right a terrible wrong, overturn their convictions and grant Damien as well as Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley a new trial,"" said Dennis Riordan, the lead attorney on the case, in September. The Arkansas Supreme Court, in its ruling, said that the circuit court erroneously interpreted the Arkansas DNA testing laws and that the three should have been granted an evidentiary hearing. Testing of the DNA in question was conducted between December 2005 and September 2007, according to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The material included hair from a ligature used to bind Moore and a hair recovered from a tree stump near where the bodies were found, court documents said. The hair found in the ligature was consistent with Branch's stepfather, Terry Hobbs, while the hair found on the tree stump was consistent with the DNA of a friend of Hobbs', according to the documents. Police have never considered Hobbs a suspect, and Hobbs maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders. Echols received a death sentence for the slayings, while Baldwin and Misskelley were sentenced to life in prison. Now 35, Echols said in September, ""I miss the things that most people take for granted, things people don't want, like rain."" Echols wrote in his 2005 autobiography, ""Almost Home,"" that police questioned him a day after the bodies of the second-graders were found. The teens -- Echols was 19 at the time, Baldwin was 16, and Misskelley was 17 -- were arrested a month later. Prosecutors successfully argued that the defendants were involved in a satanic cult and that punctures and cuts on the boys' bodies indicated a ritual sacrifice. In addition, prosecutors secured a confession from Misskelley, although his defense attorneys argued that he had a learning disability and an IQ of 70. They also claimed the confession was coerced, with neither Misskelley's parents nor an attorney present, and riddled with inconsistencies. A Little Rock, Arkansas-based group trying to raise awareness about the West Memphis 3 case has brought in celebrities such as singer Eddie Vedder and actor Johnny Depp to a recent public rally.

d9ec8c3e50de1d5af4524c26c6819e17b64090aa,CNN,"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- A fight between Ugandan and Libyan presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 African nations on Wednesday. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni attend the opening of the mosque. Several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight, which included punches, kicks and the drawing of guns. No leaders were hurt in the melee, though several were knocked over. Several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders. The incident occurred at the opening of a massive Gadhafi National Mosque in Kampala, a structure begun by the late Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972 and completed with financing from Libya, according to African media reports. Minutes after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his host, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event, the Libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque's entrance. The Ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-Arab Libyan guards at every joint event since Gadhafi's arrival in the country Sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back. Museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty Libyan guard pushed him to a wall. Another Libyan guard pushed Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards. The vice president of Tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque. Guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray, with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief. Some leaders -- notably those from Somalia, Burundi and Djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides. By the time the fight was over more than six minutes later, about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the Libyan and Ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism. ""What are your people up to? Do you want to kill our leader?"" a Libyan protocol official said to his Ugandan counterpart. The Ugandan official, who declined to be named, shouted back, ""Why do think you're superior? What makes you think Uganda has any ill intention against Gadhafi?"" The Ugandan official said Museveni's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the Libyan guards pushed them back. It has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of Kampala. It used to be a colonial fort named after British Capt. Frederick Lugard. The mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time, according to the engineers, who call it the largest mosque in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Muslims interviewed said the mosque's opening evoked sweet memories of Amin, the deceased dictator. ""It is a great day and thanks be to Allah for the completion,"" said Salim Abdul Noor, 39. ""This should remind us that while Amin is demonized as Africa's worst dictator, there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on, and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was Amin's dream, may Allah rest him in peace."" The Swedish vice president of the European Islamic Conference, Adly Abu Hajar, 57, said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to Uganda in 1844 by Arab slave traders. ""I find this complex has brought unity among Muslims in Uganda. There have been so many factions, but this attraction has brought them together, identifying themselves with a common home."" The fight prompted a crisis meeting by Ugandan security authorities, after which invited diplomats from mainly the European missions in Uganda expressed dismay. ""It's disgrace. It shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties,"" said the head of one European mission in Kampala, who declined to be named. The police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, and the head of the army, Gen. Aronda Nyakairima, declined to comment on the fight. But Capt. Edison Kwesiga, the spokesman of the Ugandan Presidential Guard Brigade, confirmed their hostile relationship with the Libyans. ""It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state. We have to do our job using any means. But our Libyan brothers always want us to fail. True, it's not the first time they come and act as you see,"" Kwesiga said. E-mail to a friend .",7,7.934021679780677
0020ede07ee7ad1f6cf654c7dc678e7341d0c0e5,CNN,"(CNN) -- Rip it up and start again. As a 20-year-old, Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros' clay courts. All the portents suggested great things were ahead of the Serbian. Here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve, with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable. But six years on, much like the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot"" -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending. Since that win in Paris in 2008, Ivanovic has suffered from big-match nerves, serving woes and a series of injury problems. It is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis, chopping and changing coaching teams along the way. Her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language. ""I've been working really hard,"" Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN's Open Court show. ""I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it's a Serbian team for me for the first time."" Ivanovic's new team includes coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic -- who represented Montenegro in the Davis Cup -- fitness coach Zlatko Novkovic and physio Branko Penic. They have all been part of her entourage since her split with British coach Nigel Sears in July, following a second-round exit at Wimbledon. Her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams. Since parting company with her early mentor Zoltan Kuharsky in 2006, she has employed David Taylor, Craig Kardon, Heinz Gunthardt, Antonio van Grichen and Sears. A number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the Adidas Player Development program. It's not just coaches that have come and gone. It's also true of fitness trainers. Such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut, desperately searching for a way out of it. Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment. ""We are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting, because the year gets very long,"" she said of her team. In Kontic, Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears, yet the 32-year-old, ranked 1,635th in men's doubles, is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity. ""I'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you,"" Ivanovic said. Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently, according to a former grand slam champion turned coach. ""She's hooked up with someone she has trust in and she's finding herself,"" Jo Durie, who won mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, told CNN. ""It's about confidence with Ana. Her sense of trust in herself is what she needs. ""A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, I can never understand that. You need to get to know someone."" Ivanovic's solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world No. 1, for 12 weeks in total. Now ranked 14th, she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009, partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris. Wrist, shoulder, foot, abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No. 65 in the rankings. Although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the WTA Tour calendar, parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players. ""Especially at the end of the year when from America we mostly go back to Europe for a week and then we go to Asia for quite a few weeks, so that's kind of tiring and hard,"" she said. ""I know it's difficult to fit it all around it, but Asia at the end of the year really gets a lot of players."" While her playing fortunes might have fluctuated, Ivanovic's marketability has never been dented. According to Forbes, she was the ninth highest-paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including Adidas, Yonex, Juice Plux and Dubai Duty Free. Ivanovic has had a number of high-profile boyfriends -- including Masters-winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco -- but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered, it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship. Her latest campaign, though, does not look like being clouded by such distraction or, just as importantly, injury. Kicking off the 2014 season in Auckland, New Zealand, she ground out a victory against fellow former No. 1 Venus Williams to end a more than two-year title drought. It was the ideal preparation for next week's Australian Open. Despite Ivanovic's obvious talent, Durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam. ""I think she'll find it difficult,"" added Durie. ""She can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches. ""She's capable of big wins, she can certainly beat players like Serena Williams. But can she beat Petra Kvitova and Serena in a row?"" Clijsters retired for a second time in 2012, having won four grand slams, as she decided to focus on her family -- and has since had a second child. Ivanovic, now 26, admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis. ""I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win,"" she told the Belgian. ""I don't want to put a date to it because I think you feel it when the time is right. Family is a big part of my life and I want to have lots of kids of my own one day. ""Tennis is a big part of my life, but it's not my whole life. So definitely I want to achieve what I can on the court and then focus.""",7,10.236149009342856
b77f1f662f2395a9c1a3dbf3d8bc80e7833cd0de,CNN,"(CNN) -- This weekend marks the kickoff of what millions of Americans have been looking forward to since the final minutes of Seattle's Super Bowl victory in early February -- another football season. Players, primed and ready, will take to the field, inspired to make their mark on the new season. Loyal fans, football-starved from a long offseason, will tune in to cheer on their hometown teams. No one can avoid the nervous energy that defines the start of a new season. But one thing fans should never have to worry about is whether or not this week's game will be impossible to watch due to a TV blackout. It is unfortunate that we will kick off yet another football season with federal rules on the books that serve only to protect the leagues at the expense of sports fans. One of these rules is the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) sports blackout rule, which prohibits a cable or satellite company from carrying a game that is blacked-out within the local broadcast area. While this affects leagues beyond the NFL, it occurs most often when, under the NFL's rules, a home game does not sell out at least 72 hours before kickoff. Under the FCC's sports blackout rule, cable and satellite companies are unable to televise that game in the local broadcast market, leaving local fans in the dark. While the blackout rule was originally cast as a way to encourage ticket sales, this rationale is no longer supported by the facts. The FCC is aware of this and voted unanimously last December to propose elimination of the rule, acknowledging that the record does not support the argument that blackouts increase ticket sales and that ""the sports blackout rules have become obsolete."" The comment period for this change concluded long ago, and the well-developed record clearly supports erasing the blackout rule from the books. But we are still waiting on the commission to cast a final vote. We wrote FCC Commissioner Tom Wheeler in June, urging him to bring the rule to a final vote before the start of the new NFL season and he indicated the FCC will do so by ""early fall."" That time has now come, another season is upon us, and there is no reason to further delay. This is not a partisan issue, as a clear majority of FCC members from both political parties supports striking the rule. In an increasingly divided government, it would be a breath of fresh air for Republican and Democratic FCC Commissioners to unite with football fans and vote to spike this outdated regulation. It is not surprising that since the vote last December, the NFL has launched an expensive lobbying and public relations campaign aimed at ensuring the blackout rule stays on the books. Their efforts have obscured the facts, arguing erroneously that the sports blackout rule has worked since its inception nearly 40 years ago. Unfortunately for the league, facts are stubborn things. Research by sports economists indicates there is no link between the blackout rule and stadium attendance. The league has even threatened to move games from free broadcast TV to pay services like cable if the FCC carries through with the vote. This last-minute pitch is all for the purpose of protecting the NFL's bottom line and preserving the status quo, which netted the league over $9 billion in revenues last year. Further, the NFL enjoys nonprofit status -- meaning it pays no income tax -- and many games are played in stadiums financed in large part with taxpayer dollars. Federal regulations shouldn't favor multi-billion dollar sports leagues over consumers, especially when those leagues have benefited so greatly from those very same taxpayers and sports fans. As the new season begins, we hope the FCC will do the right thing, and immediately vote to eliminate this outdated anti-consumer rule. At a time when Washington doesn't seem capable of achieving much, making sure fans aren't left in the dark this season could count as a real accomplishment, one deserving a cheer from the American people.",4,11.306935638265234
a06c8a361a8f27d16c1b92f83161c19c17281740,CNN,"(CNN) -- Latino voters went into the midterm election Tuesday feeling like bystanders in an American political process that is broken. An election eve poll of 5,000 Latinos who said they already had voted, or intended to vote, Tuesday was particularly telling -- more than half reported that no one had contacted them to ask for their vote. That's right, no one -- not a political campaign, not a candidate, not a community organization. Perhaps partly as a result, their motivation for voting was deeply personal, with more than a third saying they were voting to show their support for the Latino community rather than for a Democratic or Republican candidate. Such views are consistent with the research we have conducted at the NALEO Educational Fund over the past four years, among ""The Great Unengaged"" -- Latino U.S. citizens who are unlikely to vote because they believe the political system does not work for them and their families, and that political promises are made and easily broken. When they are engaged and asked to vote, they do so not for themselves, but for their families and community. This lack of engagement with the two parties did not stop NALEO Educational Fund projecting that 7.8 million Latinos would vote in this election, up from the 6.6 million who voted in 2010. And although it is too early to know if we hit that mark, we do know this much -- Latino voters are as angry about Washington paralysis as other Americans. (The lack of movement on immigration reform, an issue that for the second consecutive national election ranked as the No. 1 issue for Latino voters, was simply Exhibit A in a list of reasons why the community is frustrated). Yet the failure of lawmakers to address the key issues of interest for Latino voters is particularly perplexing when we look at what happens when politicians do take these voters into account. Colorado, one of the few states with both a large Latino electorate and a competitive Senate race, underscored how it is possible for candidates to reinvent themselves and win an election by softening their approach and addressing the issues of key importance to the Latino community. Cory Gardner, who had opposed immigration reform, was able to transform himself as a candidate by addressing the issues and focusing on compromise. Perhaps this helps explain why incumbent Mark Udall, who largely ignored the issue of immigration in hopes of not alienating non-Latinos, lost -- despite 71% of Latino voters polled in Colorado having said they would vote for him. Many likely felt disinclined to vote for Udall, reflecting the reality that Latino voters are not monolithic, and their vote is up for grabs if parties and candidates speak to their issues. Looking ahead to 2016, the campaign for the White House begins today, and a presidential election has a completely different dynamic than a mid-term election. As each of the past four presidential elections has demonstrated, the road to the White House goes through the Latino community, and amassing the required Electoral College votes requires victory in states where Latino voters make the difference. This was true in George W. Bush's successful elections in 2000 and 2004, just as it was for Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What happens next in Washington on immigration reform, and the other top issues for Latino voters -- jobs and the economy, education and health care -- will set the stage for the next election. With this in mind, the next would-be president must not only reach out and directly connect with Latino voters on the issues that most matter to them, but also show that he, or she, is from a party that is able to deliver action as well.",4,9.000691998860788
8bb3dca134c6b458d46077fb60447fc6c1d8b80d,CNN,"(CNN) -- It must have been a galling week for the Russian President. While presiding over a safe, well-run Sochi Games, President Vladimir Putin's key foreign policy objective -- to hold sway over Ukraine's place in the world -- has slipped through his fingers. At the very moment of his crowning Olympic glory, Putin probably had the second worst week of any world leader -- after Viktor Yanukovych. It is tiring to repeat truisms but this is not the Cold War and Russia is not the Soviet Union mark II -- not with 2% of the world economy and a tanking workforce population. Yet in spite of such disadvantages, Russia still desires respect, seeks attention and makes claims to greatness. And in many respects, Russia really is a ""great"" country: historically, culturally and geographically. A stroll around Moscow and St. Petersburg attests to this. So does the character of its people. Unfortunately, in the eyes of the Russian leadership, true greatness requires something more: the ability to dominate in many areas (technological, military etc.), but particularly geopolitically in large parts of the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And in its former empire above all. But this need for control over neighboring states is having precisely the opposite of its intended effect. It's too expensive for a start. The $3 billion it has spent so far in sweet-talking Ukraine to stick with Mother Russia isn't coming back. And that would have come in handy for much-needed social and infrastructural projects -- and for keeping key officials loyal to the Kremlin. But far more than money, there's an even more important reason why attempts at influence are having the opposite effect: in the long run, it can't work. It is to the West's immense and rare credit that post-Soviet state sovereignty has been a bedrock of policy since 1991. The five countries of Central Asia, the three countries of the South Caucasus, the three Baltic States, Moldova and even Belarus are universally recognized as independent countries. As is Ukraine. True, the West wobbles at times. The British government has been particularly weak of late in its unwillingness to confront Russia in case it desists from enhancing business cooperation. But by and large the West has stuck to this one principle well - at least rhetorically. Russia, on the other hand, cannot bring itself to do this even in words, let alone in actions. Naturally, everyone is now nervously looking to Putin for his next move. The press writes about the worst-case scenario, the most extreme course of action possible. And since Russia did cross international borders in anger in 2008, this is understandable. But Ukraine 2014 is not Georgia 2008. Military intervention in Ukraine would undo Russia's methodical work in discrediting the previous Mikheil Saakashvili government in Georgia and justifying its actions (protecting 'Russian' citizens) not to mention its recent diplomatic agility in Syria. These are ""achievements"" worth protecting. Reputation matters to Russia, as Sochi showed. A Russian military response with little certainty of success (unlike Georgia) is a nice fantasy for Russian hawks, but it would shatter Russia's chances of exerting influence anywhere else. So what then? Trade restrictions? Gas cut-offs? Fomenting trouble in Crimea? Russia does most of these already -- and will continue to do so. But there are no fresh moves left. Russia has lost this round, but it will live to fight another day, even as more and more statues of Lenin fall in the former provinces. The other reason for Russia's objection to Ukraine's revolution is that ""this could happen to us."" The thought that Yanukovych's fate -- or Slobodan Milosevic's or Saddam Hussein's -- could one day be theirs, cannot be a pleasant one. Clearly Putin is far from the extraordinarily inept politician that the Ukrainian president was. This buys him time. But who knows how much? Russia learns fast and is far more secure than Ukraine ever was. But all power erodes over time -- in democracies and autocracies alike. Maybe Ukraine is a mirror reflecting Russia's long- or even its medium-term future. This has been a bad week for Vladimir Putin, but it was probably a very good week for Russia.

A firefight between the soldiers and gunmen on the Egyptian side of the border ensued during the incident, injuring the suspects, according to a statement from the Israeli Defense Forces. A fourth suspect was found dead at the infiltration point, the IDF reported. Israel says the incident occurred after the suspects refused to comply with Israeli orders to stop. Egypt's head of security in northern Sinai said the men were Bedouin tobacco smugglers ""who intended to deliver cigarettes to accomplices on the other side,"" selling the stolen items for twice the normal price.

Al Masry also rejected an Israeli statement that described last month's apparent discovery of an explosive device along the border, while also scolding Israel for ""politicizing"" the incident. The suspects were airlifted by helicopter to receive medical care at an Israeli hospital. No Israeli security personnel were injured. ""Smuggling and infiltration into Israel from its western border is used by terror organizations to execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers,"" the Israeli military said in the statement. ""The IDF will continue to operate against anyone that poses a threat to the security of the State of Israel and its residents.""

65cc0ee4cdd31303d536514c7ea76a807400e565,CNN,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has signed off on a new package of nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels, U.S. officials tell CNN, signaling his administration is cautiously wading further into the conflict. Officials said the White House approved the package at a meeting of the National Security Council last week. The move reflects what officials describe as a ramped-up effort to change the military balance on the battlefield in Syria. It follows a decision by Obama last month to send food and medicine to the rebels, the first direct U.S. support for the armed opposition. Other agencies have not been briefed on the final elements of the package, which is expected to be detailed at a White House meeting this week. ""We have no new decisions on assistance to announce at this point and continue to review every possible option that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a National Security Council spokeswoman. Officials said it is expected to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is defensive in nature, but could be used to aid in combat by Syrian rebels battling forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The package being discussed, however, still falls short of the heavy weapons and high tech equipment sought by the rebels. Obama's national security team and members of Congress have repeatedly urged the president to increase the direct aid for the rebels. They argue such a step would strengthen the hand of moderate members of the opposition and make them less reliant on well-armed extremist elements within their ranks. Secretary of State John Kerry has pushed for more aggressive U.S. involvement in Syria since taking office in February. The move comes as Britain and France are leading efforts to lift a European Union arms embargo on Syria. Both have suggested they are prepared to join nations like Qatar is providing the rebels with weapons and are urging the United States to do the same. A push last summer from CIA, Pentagon and State Department leaders was rejected by the White House. At least for now, it remains opposed to arming the opposition, fearing that U.S.-provided weapons could wind up in the wrong hands. The Obama administration has funneled $385 million in humanitarian aid to Syria through international institutions and nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Washington has provided more than $100 million to the political opposition and has pressed them to establish a leadership structure. But the Syrian Opposition Council, the main Syrian opposition group, has roundly criticized the United States for refusing to provide badly-needed support to organize a transitional government and broaden its support inside Syria.",3,5.572302176548821
cfe0528b218322a2e02ff433461097e580896f4a,CNN,"(CNN) -- Last September, William Jeffrey Dumas was convicted of three counts of rape. According to the charges, he had raped a woman three times over a night and the following morning, and the jury agreed with the prosecution that he was guilty. But just last week, a judge overturned the jury's conviction and ordered a new trial. The Georgia appeals court judge, Christopher McFadden, argued that the verdict went ""strongly against the weight of the evidence"" because, in his judgment, the woman in question -- I'll join other writers in calling her Jane -- didn't act like a victim and the man didn't act like a rapist. Jane has Down syndrome and the growing national outrage to this case has focused, with reason, on her disability. But Down syndrome is only part of the story. The outrage is not only because this judge didn't understand Down syndrome, but that judges frequently impose their perceptions on cases of sexual assault, reducing sentences even for convicted rapists on the grounds that the victim didn't act ""correctly."" Jane's troubling case reveals the intersections between rape culture and the way we strip agency from people with disabilities. Here are a few details. In October of 2010, Jeffrey Dumas was hanging out with friends in a home where a 24-year-old woman with Down syndrome was staying while her mother was out of town. According to the complaint, Dumas raped the woman three times over an evening and the following morning, but she made no ""outcry"" until the following day, despite having ample opportunities to tell the other adults in the house. People with intellectual disabilities, especially women and girls, are sexually assaulted at a much higher rate than the rest of the population. People with intellectual disabilities, even those with strong communication skills, can be vulnerable to sexual assault because they are unsure of what's right or wrong or whether they can say no. They rarely receive sexual education or are provided assertiveness training. Given this context, one might well invoke Down syndrome to explain the delay between the assault and the complaint. Most important, during the trial, Jane testified that she was raped, the jury believed her, and the medical and physical evidence confirmed her story. But the judge, acting as he says in his decision, as the 13th juror, saw things differently. McFadden writes that although ""the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction,"" he offers a long list of confusing aspects in the testimony, which he boils down to, ""At no time prior to her outcry on the 19th (the next day), did (she) behave like a victim. Nor did Mr. Dumas behave like someone who had recently perpetrated a series of violent crimes against her."" I don't pretend to know what happened on the night of October 18 in the Fayetteville, Georgia, home. But I do know that what happened in the courtroom is not just about disability and agency, but about rape and the way authorities respond to women's testimony. Down syndrome may be a reason this judge decided that Jane's words carried less weight when measured against his perception, but many nondisabled women, women of all social classes, races, sexual orientations, and levels of ability, have experienced precisely the same kind of dismissal. Here are a few examples that do not involve disability. Last year in Montana, a judge reduced a former teacher's rape conviction to 31 days because the victim, a 14-year-old girl, was ""as much in control of the situation"" as her rapist and, in his opinion, ""older than her chronological age."" In California, a judge reduced a sentence of a convicted rapist because the woman didn't fight hard enough. The judge said, ""If someone doesn't want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down. The body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage is inflicted, and we heard nothing about that in this case. That tells me that the victim in this case, although she wasn't necessarily willing, she didn't put up a fight."" In Arizona, a judge reduced a sentence of a police officer convicted of sexual abuse to community service and probation, instead blaming the victim for being in a bar. The judge said, ""If you wouldn't have been there that night, none of this would have happened to you. ... When you blame others, you give up your power to change."" In Alabama, a judge structured a 40-year sentence for rape  so the rapist would serve two years in a community program for nonviolent criminals and three years of probation at home. The judge, much like McFadden, argued that the victim just didn't behave correctly. He said, ""You didn't hear the evidence. The original allegation was that both of these crimes were forcible. But then you have to believe that although she was forcibly raped twice, she continued to come back and have a social relationship (with the rapist)."" Other women have been prosecuted for false reporting of rape because they didn't ""act traumatized."" Rape convictions have been vacated entirely because the victim didn't fight back, such as in Connecticut, when the state supreme court freed a rapist because his victim, a woman with cerebral palsy and a mental age of 3, with no ability to speak, didn't bite, kick, or scratch her attacker. As disability blogger Sarah Levis has commented, all of these stories should push our attention to this aspect of rape culture in the courtroom. Rape culture creates the myth that victims of rape must react within a predictable set of norms or raise doubts about the legitimacy of the rape. All of these women, including Jane, behaved in a way that judges didn't understand, so they overturned convictions or reduced sentences. And here is where disability comes back into play. Because of her Down syndrome, Jane is relatively immune to the kinds of victim-blaming endured by other women who are assaulted or abused. We know she wasn't asking for it. We can't blame her for staying in the house while Dumas got drunk. We know she didn't encourage him, then change her mind the next day. All of the myths about false reporting of rape don't apply to Jane because of her disability, and for that at least we can be thankful. Jane's experience points to the offensive way women's behaviors are interrogated when they seek justice. I hope that Jane and Dumas get justice in their next trial. If there are discrepancies in the timeline of events, as the court documents suggest, let them be explored. After an outcry, Judge McFadden recused himself from the retrial, which seems like a good decision. But as the next trial unfolds, do not focus on Jane because she is a woman with Down syndrome. Focus on Jane because she is a woman who says that she was raped. Focus on Jane because she's joined the ranks of other women, women of all races, classes, sexual orientations, and levels of ability who have said that they were raped and then had their testimony disregarded by a judge on the basis of not acting enough like a victim. There is no one correct way to respond to being violated, but there are so many ways that our justice system can make it worse.

403a8ac56dde228f359a3d7d7e0dd4c754778ce5,CNN,"Canandaigua, New York (CNN) -- ""Can you say that again? You put a bullet through the wall in your house?"" Angela Price begins this evening at work like any, listening to troubled veterans in need of a sympathetic ear or immediate help. She reaches for a pen and paper. She's a trained responder for the Veterans Affairs Department's National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the upstate New York town of Canandaigua. She asks a series of questions: ""Where's the gun at now?... OK, so the gun is nowhere near you? ... OK, I'm glad that you're safe,"" she says, somewhat relieved but still concerned about the caller. Price is one of some 20 responders, counselors, social workers and health tech assistants staffing 15 phone lines and three chat lines at the center at any given time. She talks with the caller for 45 minutes. He shot a bullet into the wall of his house and then went for a drive. She is able to coax him to pull over, calm him down, and arrange for follow-up care. Most of the callers want information regarding mental health and other medical services available to them provided at their local VA hospitals. But for others, the call they're making is a last resort. Each year, more than 30,000 people kill themselves, 20 percent of them veterans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's 18 veteran suicides a day. Every call presents another opportunity for the hot line responders to try to prevent another tragedy. The crisis center, staffed around the clock seven days a week, opened in July 2007, largely borne from widespread criticism that the department was not responding adequately to veterans in crisis. Janet Kemp, the Veterans Administration Suicide Prevention Coordinator, says the phones haven't stopped ringing since the hot line's inception. ""It's about being able to provide them with immediate assistance, immediate resources, appointments. It assures that we're not going to let them drop through the cracks after they hang up the phone,"" Kemp says. Before the VA suicide prevention program began, that wasn't always the case. Jim and Marianne Schulze told CNN in early 2007 that their son Jonathan, an Iraq combat veteran, killed himself in January of that year, after being told he was No. 26 on a waiting list to get checked into a VA hospital. The Schulzes said their son had been suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder for nearly two years. He died with an extension cord wrapped around his neck, a picture of his daughter by his side, they said. Six months later, the VA Suicide Prevention Lifeline opened. To date, the crisis center has received almost 250,000 calls. ""The health techs assist the counselors in getting the person the services they need at the time,"" Kemp says. ""If they need emergency services or information, the health techs can pick that up, and find the person who can help them in their local area, and make those connections."" If necessary, the center arranges an emergency rescue, or in less dire circumstances, a wellness checkup at the caller's home. The center also follows up the next day, according to Kemp. The 2010 hot line budget is more than $15 million, including staffing, phone and contract costs and more than $4 million for public messaging campaigns, according to the VA. The center's newest feature is a chat line for those who prefer computer-oriented communication, especially young vets such as those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Since that's been open, we've talked to several thousand people over the chat and have been able to facilitate some rescues through that service."" Chat counselor Rich Barham recalls an incident while chatting with a Navy vet who barricaded himself in his house, with two children asleep upstairs, as he suffered flashbacks from Iraq. Barham sent help. ""When the police broke in, I heard he had a gun, and I was hoping bad things weren't going to happen to him,"" Barham says. ""We were able to get his wife on the phone, and he was taken to the hospital and she was able to come home to take care of the kids."" Hot line responder Christopher Maginn is in the Army Reserves, and he just returned from serving in Afghanistan. ""For me, it's kind of hitting two birds with one stone, because I get to work with guys that have worn the uniform, and I still wear the uniform today, so, it's always meant a lot to me to work here,"" says Maginn. Many callers are recent Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with reintegration, he said. Often, they're too proud to pick up a phone and ask for help. The main goal is ""to listen to them, and to validate what they're going through, and provide them services,"" he said. Kemp says it's all in an important day's work. ""I feel lots of times it's their last hope, their last chance, and if we can provide that little bit of hope, and get them to realize that they called and there are options,"" says Kemp. ""It's an amazing feeling."" The phone number for the hot line is 800-273-TALK (8255). The chat line is at www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.",8,8.831950632933854
16604ed2399eeccbf47652a43ed2ea37aad28d04,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Over-the-counter cold and cough medicines don't work for children under age 6, and giving the common medicine to young children cannot be recommended, a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee said in October. An FDA panel has called for more studies on how cold medicines affect children. The panel of health experts, which looked at how safe and effective antihistamines, decongestants, antitussins and expectorants are in children, said it is not appropriate to take data from adults and apply it to children under 12. After a two-day hearing, the panel called for more studies about how the medicines affect children. Although the panel's recommendation is nonbinding, it could lead to changes in how cough and cold medicines are used. The votes are to be taken into consideration by FDA regulators, who might take action against the products at a later time. Dr. Jeff Jenkins, of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said it could take a year or even years for the agency to make a final decision on the recommendations. During the panel's meeting, the experts looked at a number of proposals, including whether multiple-symptom over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold medicines should be banned for children under 6 years old. FDA experts voted 13-9 that certain cold medicines with certain ingredients should not be used by young children. The committee said medicines with the same ingredients could be used by children ages 6 to 12. The experts voted unanimously to require that standardized dosing devices accompany all liquid medicines, in an effort to reduce the likelihood of excessive or unintentional overdosing. Separately, the committee voted to allow marketing of multiple-symptom products to children between the ages of 2 and 12 if new research showed the products to be safe and effective. Combination products can be particularly susceptible to problems with overdosing because parents sometimes don't realize they are duplicating ingredients. Committee members also emphasized the importance of proper and easy-to-read labels. Dr. Daniel Rausch, director of the pediatric hospital program for New York University, said that cold medicine is effective only at doses that are too strong for young children. Rausch recommends a more traditional treatment where dosing isn't a problem: chicken soup. ""A cold does not kill, so people should just relax,"" Rausch said. ""Kids get sick and there's nothing that people can do about it, but they will get better."" About 800 pediatric cough and cold products are sold in the United States, many using multiple ingredients that have been marketed for use in children for some 30 years. Earlier this year, the FDA completed a review that found that between 1969 and the fall of 2006, there were 54 reported child deaths from decongestants and 69 from antihistamines.   Watch one family's tragic ending » . Most of the deaths occurred in children under 2. In August, federal health officials recommended the ""consult your physician"" advice to parents on the labels of cold and cough medicines aimed at young children be replaced by a warning not to use the medications in children under 2 unless directed to do so by a health care provider. Before the FDA hearings, some of the leading manufacturers of cold and cough medicines announced a voluntary recall of more than a dozen cold medicines for infants. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said the products were being pulled ""out of an abundance of caution."" Potential misuse of the medications, not product safety, is driving the voluntary withdrawal, the group said. The American Academy of Pediatrics applauded last week's decision to pull those products, saying, ""These medicines are ineffective and can have serious side effects. There are other ways to treat cold symptoms."" The AAP suggests: . When the drug industry voluntarily withdrew products last week, it insisted that when used as directed, the drugs are safe, and they work. ""Parents can continue to trust over-the-counter cough and cold remedies for their children,"" said Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. ""We strongly encourage parents to adhere to the recommended dosing instructions for all medicines, recognizing that the vast majority of adverse events associated with their use are due to inadvertent overdosing and misuse."" Suydam said CHPA will be launching a major educational campaign for parents and caregivers in coming months. Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein headed the push that led to the FDA hearing. He became alarmed when four Baltimore children died after their parents gave them excessive doses of cold medicines. Until those deaths, he did not realize that a dose of cold medicine could turn into a life-and-death issue among young children, he said. E-mail to a friend .",3,8.24359771016738

A large percentage of those travelers are expected to be looking for alternative accommodations, such as private homes, bed and breakfasts and hostels. According to the Brazilian daily, some four-room penthouses in Ipanema are asking $150,000 for one month's rental. A studio apartment in Copacabana is being rented out at $7,000 for four weeks, while a villa is using the deposit from a booking already made for next summer to renovate the house for more such rentals. Hotel infrastructure for Brazil's most anticipated mega-event has been a concern, but the local hotel industry says it's confident it will be ready to face the onslaught of tourists. The city also plans to berth six cruise ships as tourist accommodation. Marcelo Rocha e Silva Zorovich, a visiting researcher at the University of Miami, told the Los Angeles Times last month that providing enough hotel rooms for the event was a big concern. ""We'll make it to the Cup but the infrastructure won't be ready,"" Zorovich said. According to the Times, Rio is planning to construct around 22,000 new rooms, but experts are skeptical that number will be reached in time.",7,7.277530318789407
33cf4b6fc85238d6e499e3fb361699eaacffbdb0,CNN,"(CNN) -- All five members of a family found slain inside a Beason, Illinois, home early this week were beaten to death, police said Thursday. Police officers stand patrol outside the Gee household late Monday evening. A pathologist determined that the five -- Raymond Gee, 46; Ruth Gee, 39; and three children -- had been beaten, Logan County Sheriff Steve Nichols told reporters. ""All the injuries at the scene were from blunt-force trauma."" The three children were identified as Justina Constant, 16, Dillen Constant, 14, and Austin Gee, 11. A 3-year-old girl remained in critical but stable condition Thursday at a hospital, Nichols said. He said he would not divulge or speculate what the family was beaten with, and remained tight-lipped about many aspects of the deaths, including when authorities believe they occurred. Beason is in central Illinois, about 45 miles northeast of Springfield, the state capital. A task force has been formed with officers from several different agencies to investigate the homicides, the sheriff said. Processing of the crime scene concluded Wednesday afternoon, and ""hundreds of seized items"" are being processed, he said. ""Forensic evidence in this case is significant."" The sheriff has said authorities received a 911 call about a possible shooting at the home shortly before 4:30 p.m. Monday. Nichols said authorities are looking for a gray-primer-painted pickup truck that was seen in the area Sunday night. ""We'll take any tip that anybody has,"" he said. A tip line has been set up at 217-732-3000, Nichols said.",1,7.232488107087249
d739b2dc9706a287f3404374cd8580d920153b85,CNN,"(CNN) -- After two days of violence and looting that claimed the lives of at least 48 people, relative calm settled over Madagascar Wednesday. But the possibility of further violence loomed as anti-government protesters gathered in a central square, vowing future demonstrations. At least 48 people were killed during the riots that broke out in Madagascar. President Marc Ravalomanana and other senior government officials surveyed some of the damage Wednesday and vowed to restore order ""whatever the cost,"" a government statement said. Ravalomanana ordered a member of his joint chiefs of staff to work with the protesters and opposition leader Andry Rajoelina to keep the calm. Meanwhile, Rajoelina -- mayor of the capital, Antananarivo -- addressed the protesters at a downtown rally Wednesday afternoon, calling for two days of general strikes and another mass demonstration Saturday. The strikes would prevent stores and schools from opening. On Tuesday the authorities tried to control protesters who set fire to the state-run media complex the day before. Ravalomanana said he initially held off on ordering troops to fight off looters, saying he wanted to avoid more casualties. ""It is better that equipment be destroyed rather than human lives,"" he said in the statement, adding that looters would not be prosecuted because he ""understands the Malagasy people are poor and hungry."" A spokesman for Joseph Ravohanjy Hospital said 48 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the violence since Monday. By Wednesday, a relative calm had fallen over the area and Rajoelina's rally at the square was peaceful, a Western observer told CNN. The violence began when protesters stormed the government's radio and television station in Antananarivo, Monday morning in response to Ravalomanana shutting down Rajoelina's radio station hours earlier. Ravalomanana's move came just weeks after closing Rajoelina's television station last month after the airing of an interview with ousted ex-President Didier Ratsiraka. Viva Radio was back on the air Tuesday as the protesters broadened their focus from restoring freedom of speech to targeting businesses owned by Ravalomanana, including food distribution centers, according to an American community worker in Antananarivo. By Tuesday afternoon, some of the protesters had broken from the group, looting private electronic shops and grocery stores that sat alongside the Ravalomanana-owned buildings, Christi Turner said. ""Today and yesterday, it's been a collective disappointment and shock and sadness for me and my friends and other aid workers,"" Turner told CNN on Tuesday night. ""People have lost their heads in the mob mentality."" She added that the government ""is not taking the most effective steps controlling the situation,"" noting that military and police didn't publicly address the looters until Tuesday. Reports of injuries and deaths from resulting fires could not be immediately confirmed. Rodney Ford, public affairs officer for the U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo, said the United States is calling for calm and pushing for dialogue between the president and the mayor. Both sides have offered to negotiate, which a group of ambassadors is working toward. ""We are worried about the loss of life,"" Ford said. ""The Malagasy people need to work this out, it's not an issue outsiders can fix. The U.S. Embassy is calling for calm and restraint. We are working to mediate within both parties.""",2,8.722774443039807
e0aa91acaa80b4d5220c4ac27ab0c0b7e77e2421,CNN,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Five security guards from Blackwater Worldwide have been indicted on charges related to a 2007 shooting in which 17 Iraqis were killed in a Baghdad square, two sources said Friday. An Iraqi woman looks at a blood-stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nusoor Square shooting. A sixth security guard is in plea negotiations, the sources told CNN. The exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury were not revealed. The sources requested anonymity because the indictment remains under court seal. It is expected to be made public by Justice Department officials as early as Monday. The Justice Department had no comment on the development, and defense attorneys for the men could not be reached for reaction. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, also had no comment. Blackwater said it wouldn't comment until there's an official announcement. Iraqi authorities accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the September 2007 shootings in Nusoor Square in western Baghdad. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents. The guards returned fire, Blackwater said. But an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon, sources told CNN. The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is the uncertain limit of a law passed by Congress that prevents prosecution of military personnel or others working for the military and leaves open the question of those working for other U.S. government departments and agencies abroad. The incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws. Security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. But starting next year, under a U.S.-Iraq security agreement that Iraq approved Thursday, Iraq will have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. The State Department renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government.",3,4.888179835371942
6a0150b36507a804bd9afcc31c08fda1f08d5348,CNN,"(CNN) -- As Islamists in northern Mali threatened to ""open the gates of hell,"" the United States is navigating one tricky quandary: how does it help in the battle against the militants without violating its own policy? U.S. policy prohibits direct military aid to Mali because the fledgling government is a result of a coup. Read more: Panetta: U.S. could provide logistical, intel support in Mali . No support can go to the Malian military directly until leaders are elected through an election, said Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman. ""We are not in a position to train the Malian military until we have democracy restored,"" she said this week. The international community is concerned that the militants will create a terrorist haven in the desert region, which analysts say has the potential to become the next Afghanistan. Read more: France vows to halt jihadist charge in Mali . Though Islamist militant groups affiliated with al Qaeda, such as Ansar Dine, are rampant in the north, they co-exist with other anti-government opportunists, complicating U.S. involvement in an offensive touted as anti-terror. As the defiant militants hunker down, administration officials are reviewing their options to support France, which is spearheading the international effort to oust the rebels in its former colony. Others in the international community have joined forces to help the weak Malian forces ward off instability that could reverberate worldwide. Read more: Rebels still hold key town in Mali, French defense minister says . So far, however, the United States has only shared intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said. The Pentagon is also considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. Read more: Islamist rebels gaining ground in Mali, French defense minister says . ""We've had a number of requests for support from the French in support of their operation,"" Nuland said in a state briefing Tuesday. ""They've asked for information sharing, they've asked for support with airlift, they've asked for support with aerial refueling. We are already providing information and we are looking hard today at the airlift question, helping them transport forces from France and from the area into the theater."" Ansar Dine would welcome U.S. troops on the ground, its commander, Omar Hamaha, told CNN's Erin Burnett. By fighting alongside Malian forces, ""France is signing a death warrant for French people around the world, opening the gates of hell,"" Hamaha said. ""This will be a long war ... more dangerous than Afghanistan and Iraq."" Other ways to help . Though the U.S. is wary of any troop involvement, it has found other ways to help. It is accelerating efforts to deploy West African troops to Mali. The Economic Community of West African States meets Friday to finalize plans that will be presented to the heads of state a day later in Ivory Coast. Nuland said the United States has offered pre-deployment training to West African troops, equipment and help in lifting them to Mali. Funding the troops so they can fight alongside their Malian counterparts does not violate U.S. law, she said. ""We are precluded under the counter-coup restrictions from funding a military that has been involved in a coup until democracy has been restored,"" she said. ""But we're not precluded from assisting allies and partners in trying to restore security to that country."" Several countries offer troops . Last week, French troops and warplanes joined Malian government forces to battle Islamist militants, who have seized most of the African nation's northern region. France said it has committed about 1,700 troops to the effort, including about 800 on the ground in Mali. France: We're not the pacifists you think we are . French President Francois Hollande said his nation has no intention of staying in Mali permanently, but it will do what is necessary to prepare for African forces. The United Nations said preparations are under way for a multidisciplinary team to go to Bamako. Leaders from a number of countries have offered troops or logistical support for the offensive. A Canadian military transport plane departed for Mali on Tuesday, where it will transport equipment and personnel. Two British military transport aircraft have been assigned to help with the French troop deployment, but no British forces will be in a combat role. The Nigerian army said it plans to deploy 900 soldiers within 10 days as part of a U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents. A cycle of unrest . Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of the area the size of France. In addition to the al Qaeda threat, amputations, floggings and public executions have become common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law that included banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports. What's behind the instability in Mali .

3fed4067f60aaeb3b923178e83d550db2b2fd737,CNN,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain has won a major victory in its long court battle with a Florida-based deep-sea salvage company over rights to an estimated $500 million in silver and gold coins, officials said Wednesday. The treasure was recovered in 2007 from a 19th century sunken ship off the Spanish coast. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday turned aside another motion from the U.S.-based company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, and Spanish officials said they now expect the coins -- nearly 600,000 of them -- to arrive in Spain soon. ""With the ruling by the appeals court, the process begins to recover all of the coins taken illegally"" from the sunken ship, Spain's Culture Ministry said in a statement. Odyssey, which can still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a statement, ""Currently, no final order has been issued in the case and it would be premature to comment at this time."" The battle royal began after Odyssey announced in 2007 it had found the sunken treasure. It quickly laid claim to the coins, put them in crates and said it flew them to a discreet, well-guarded location in the United States. Spain soon filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The Mercedes, a 34-gun frigate, left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes exploded after being hit in its power magazine, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. The federal court in Tampa in 2009 ruled in favor of Spain's claim to the treasure, but Odyssey took the case to the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which ruled last September to uphold the lower court's ruling. At the end of that 53-page ruling, the three-judge appeals panel wrote, ""For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err when it ordered Odyssey to release the recovered"" items to the custody of Spain, according to a copy of the order viewed by CNN. Since then, Odyssey has filed various motions at the appeals court to overturn or delay the ruling, said James Goold, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is representing Spain in the case. But on Tuesday, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, the court's chief deputy clerk, Amy Nerenberg, told CNN by phone from Atlanta. Goold, who spoke to CNN by phone from Washington, said it appears that Odyssey's only possible appeal now would be to the U.S. Supreme Court. That court agrees to hear only a tiny portion of the cases presented to it. The appeals court is expected to send the case in the coming days back to the federal court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said. Spain believes that the main part of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said. Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignaico Wert, told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about the money. ""We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,"" Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited in Spanish museums. Peru has also followed this case. The silver and gold came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. ""Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,"" Wert said. The treasure includes a vast trove of coins, included fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials said at a 2008 news conference. The treasure already has crossed the Atlantic ocean twice -- by ship in 1804 and then by plane in the other direction just a few years ago. Spanish officials hope it might finally arrive now for the first time on the Spanish mainland.",1,13.587706690715825
87ffdc7232808040c73278ff796563e6aead065e,CNN,"Bangkok (CNN) -- Yingluck Shinawatra was poised to become Thailand's first female prime minister Sunday after her party won a majority of parliamentary seats in the nation's general elections. The official tally had not yet been completed, but with more than 90 percent of votes counted Sunday night, Yingluck's Pheu Thai party had won 262 seats in the country's 500-seat parliament. ""The first thing I want to do is help people on their economic situation,"" she said earlier Sunday, refusing to declare victory until the official count was over. Minutes before, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva conceded that she had won. Yingluck is the younger sister of one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. Two years later, he left the country after being convicted on conflict of interest charges -- accusations that he still denies. Flags with his image waved in the sticky night air outside the Pheu Thai headquarters. A child wearing a shirt with his sister Yingluck's picture on it walked past them, trying to get closer to the celebration outside. Yingluck's critics worry she will simply do her brother's bidding -- something she has denied. Before she even gave her victory speech, her brother shared his comments from exile in Dubai. ""Well, I would tell them that I really want to go back, but I will wait for the right moment and the right situation,"" Thaksin told reporters. The Pheu Thai party remains fiercely behind Thaksin and wants him to return. The so-called ""Yellow Shirts,"" a group that formed to oust Thaksin from power, will do whatever they can to stop that from happening. What does his sister say about all this? CNN asked her three days before the election. ""I can't do anything special for my brother so as long as if my brother will be every process we will follow by the rule of law,"" Yingluck said. With about 47 million eligible voters in Thailand, Sunday's balloting was held to decide Thailand's first general election since 2007, an election that many hope will bring an end to years of unrest between two political factions that climaxed last year with protests that turned deadly. ""There is a lot more hard work to do in the future for the well-being of our sisters and brothers, the people of Thailand,"" Yingluck said Sunday. ""There are many things to accomplish to make reconciliation possible, paving the way for a solid foundation for a flourishing nation."" Tensions between the Democratic Party and the Pheu Thai party, which reflect deep divisions within Thai society, erupted last year, with protests against Abhisit's government leading to a military crackdown. More than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured. After the riots, the Thai government pledged to work toward a process of national reconciliation to heal class and political divisions, though the divide between the two groups remains wide. But average Thai voters were more concerned with economic issues, wanting their leaders to shrink the gap between what they earn and the skyrocketing cost of living. Thai election makes history but can winners keep promises? ""Free education is good, care for elderly is also good. In fact every parties' policies are all good, the question is if they would ever implement them."" Banorn Achriyawatkul said as she worked outside a polling station. After being laid off from her job as a secretary, the mother of four is now a food vendor in the streets, trying to make ends meet. Despite the animosity between them, the two major parties have made very similar promises to the people: a better economy, free education, and a major increase in the minimum wage -- exactly what many voters wanted to hear. But analysts say the extravagant programs will cost more than Thailand can afford. Supong Limtanakool of Bangkok University's Center for Strategic Studies said both parties made big promises they just can't keep. ""It will be something that we have to spend somewhere between an additional 1.5 trillion baht to 7.5 trillion baht (49 billion dollars to 244 billion dollars) with all the extravagant programs, which is five times the national budget. ... I mean, we'll be broke in one year,"" he said. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Benjamin Gottlieb contributed to this report.",7,9.417860554428122

The ash forced the closure of Icelandic airspace over the weekend, raising the specter of the kind of disruption of trans-Atlantic and European air travel that took place last year. But Britain's CAA said new arrangements have been put in place since last year's eruption of another Icelandic volcano, and those changes should reduce the number of flights that have to be canceled if the ash cloud spreads. The main international airport in Iceland reopened Monday evening, according to the airport's website. There were no international flights in or out of the country on Sunday after Grimsvotn -- Europe's most active volcano -- began to erupt on Saturday. Last year, trans-Atlantic and European air traffic was snarled for weeks by an ash cloud from the other volcano, Eyjafjallajokull. The Grimsvotn volcano under the Vatnajokull glacier erupted Saturday, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The last eruption of the volcano was in 2004, CNN affiliate TV2 Iceland reported. Grimsvotn is Iceland's most frequently active volcano. In 1783, a 16.7-mile fissure system from the volcano produced the world's largest known historical lava flow over a seven-month period, damaging crops and livestock, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned Tuesday that the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the plant remains ""very high."" Radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors.

No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said.

The captain was arrested off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea, after his vessel crashed into two Japanese patrol boats. He was accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed their duties. ""The Japanese side bears full responsibility for the current situation, and it shall bear all the consequences that arise,"" Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Tuesday in New York, as China escalated demands for the captain's release. Wen was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. Word of his release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China. The four are being investigated for entering a military zone without authorization and videotaping military targets, Chinese state media said. Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals, however. The four Japanese nationals were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army, their company said Friday. A Chinese national also is missing and presumed arrested with his Japanese co-workers on Wednesday in northern Hebei Province. They work for Fujita Corp., a mid-size Japanese construction company that Goldman Sachs Group acquired in April 2009. Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained. ""Currently, the case is being investigated,"" is all that Chinese security authorities in Shijiazhuang said in a statement, the state-run China Daily reported. But Beijing had plenty to say about Japan detaining the Chinese fishing captain. Japan ""illegally arrested"" him and his crew of 14, China said. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan earlier this month freed the fishing captain's crew. China's Foreign Ministry said that Japan had ""seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations"" with the arrest of the captain and his crew. In response, China halted talks with Japan about increasing civil flights and expanding aviation rights between the two countries. Officials and nationals on both sides also canceled trips to each other's nations. CNN's Jo Kent contributed to this report.",7,10.269666474645149
