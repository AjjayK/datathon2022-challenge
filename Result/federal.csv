XA1C6D6B906412C,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service, in response to disruptions resulting from Hurricane Ian, will not impose a penalty when dyed diesel fuel with a sulfur content that does not exceed 15 parts-per-million is sold for use or used by emergency vehicles on the highway in the state of Florida.

This relief begins on September 28, 2022, and will remain in effect through October 19, 2022.

This penalty relief is available to any person that sells or uses dyed diesel fuel in an emergency vehicle for highway use. In the case of the operator of the emergency vehicle in which the dyed diesel fuel is used, the relief is available only if the operator or the person selling such fuel pays the tax of 24.4 cents per gallon that is normally applied to diesel fuel for highway use.

The IRS will not impose penalties for failure to make semimonthly deposits of tax for dyed diesel fuel sold for use or used in an emergency vehicle on the highway in the state of Florida during the relief period. IRS Publication 510, Excise Taxes, has information on the proper method for reporting and paying the tax.

Ordinarily, dyed diesel fuel is not taxed, because it is sold for uses exempt from excise tax, such as to farmers for farming purposes, for home heating use, and to local governments.

The IRS is closely monitoring the situation and will provide additional relief as needed.",0,8.501063088463424

X8F6AE5407A8934,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The IRS issued a notice today announcing relief for certain retirement plans that do not have a written plan in place by January 1, 2009. The new guidance is for retirement plans covering employees at public schools, colleges and universities, and other tax exempt organizations. These retirement plans are often referred to as 403(b) plans after the relevant section in the tax code.

The IRS is extending the deadline for plan sponsors to adopt new written plans or amend existing plans to satisfy the requirement of the final 403(b) regulations because of difficulties expressed by numerous plan administrators in meeting the current deadline of January 1, 2009.  This extension will give plan sponsors additional time to put their plan documents in place.

The IRS will treat these plans as meeting the requirements of 403(b) and the regulations during the 2009 calendar year if:

By December 31, 2009, the plan sponsor of the plan has adopted a written 403(b) plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements of 403(b) and the regulations.
During 2009, the plan sponsor operates the plan in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of 403(b) and the related regulations.
By the end of 2009, the plan sponsor makes its best effort to retroactively correct any operational failure during the 2009 calendar year to conform to the written plan.
The IRS plans to issue further guidance on 403(b) plans, including a revenue procedure establishing programs for 403(b) plans to obtain IRS approval of the plan document and allowing these plans to make remedial amendments to retroactively fix plan provisions under rules that similar to those that apply for 401(a) qualified plans.

X3776BE87ACA078,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service announced today that taxpayers who qualify for the first-time homebuyer credit and purchase a home this year before Dec. 1 have a special option available for claiming the tax credit either on their 2008 tax returns due April 15 or on their 2009 tax returns next year.

Qualifying taxpayers who buy a home this year before Dec. 1 can get up to $8,000, or $4,000 for married filing separately.

“For first-time homebuyers this year, this special feature can put money in their pockets right now rather than waiting another year to claim the tax credit,"" said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. “This important change gives qualifying homebuyers cash they do not have to pay back.”

The IRS has posted a revised version of Form 5405, First-Time Homebuyer Credit, on IRS.gov. The revised form incorporates provisions from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The instructions to the revised Form 5405 provide additional information on who can and cannot claim the credit, income limitations and repayment of the credit.

This year, qualifying taxpayers who buy a home before Dec. 1, 2009, can claim the credit on either their 2008 or 2009 tax returns. They do not have to repay the credit, provided the home remains their main home for 36 months after the purchase date. They can claim 10 percent of the purchase price up to $8,000, or $4,000 for married individuals filing separately.

The amount of the credit begins to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income is more than $75,000, or $150,000 for joint filers.

For purposes of the credit, you are considered to be a first-time homebuyer if you, and your spouse if you are married, did not own any other main home during the three-year period ending on the date of purchase.

The IRS also alerted taxpayers that the new law does not affect people who purchased a home after April 8, 2008, and on or before Dec. 31, 2008. For these taxpayers who are claiming the credit on their 2008 tax returns, the maximum credit remains 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $7,500, or $3,750 for married individuals filing separately. In addition, the credit for these 2008 purchases must be repaid in 15 equal installments over 15 years, beginning with the 2010 tax year.",0,7.17049440537492

“I urge taxpayers to be wary of clicking on strange emails and websites,” said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. “They may be scams to steal your personal information.”

Specifically, the bogus email asks tax professionals to update their IRS e-services portal information and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs). The links that are provided in the bogus email to access IRS e-services appear to be a phishing scheme designed to capture your username and password. This email was not generated by the IRS e-services program. Disregard this email and do not click on the links provided.

Phishing made this year’s Dirty Dozen list of IRS tax scams. The full list is available on IRS.gov.

Phishing is a scam typically carried out with the help of unsolicited email or a fake website that poses as a legitimate site to lure in potential victims and prompt them to provide valuable personal and financial information. Armed with this information, a criminal can commit identity theft or financial theft.

If you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from either the IRS or an organization closely linked to the IRS, such as the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, report it by sending it to phishing@irs.gov.

In general, the IRS has added and strengthened protections in our processing systems this filing season to protect the nation's taxpayers. For this tax season, we continue to make important progress in stopping identity theft and other fraudulent refunds.

It is important to keep in mind the IRS generally does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels. The IRS has information online that can help you protect yourself from email scams.",0,9.253706917791533

The new procedure allows small businesses to change a method of accounting under the final tangible property regulations on a prospective basis for the first taxable year beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2014.

Also, the IRS is waiving the requirement to complete and file a Form 3115 for small business taxpayers that choose to use this simplified procedure for 2014.

X9A1D9468438744,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced the nationwide rollout of a streamlined program designed to enable small businesses under audit to more quickly settle their differences with the IRS.

The Fast Track Settlement (FTS) program is designed to help small businesses and self-employed individuals who are under examination by the Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) Division of the IRS. Modeled on a similar program long available to large and mid-size businesses (those with more than $10 million in assets), FTS uses alternative dispute resolution techniques to help taxpayers save time and avoid a formal administrative appeal or lengthy litigation. As a result, audit issues can usually be resolved within 60 days, rather than months or years. Plus, taxpayers choosing this option lose none of their rights because they still have the right to appeal even if the FTS process is unsuccessful.  

Jointly administered by SB/SE and the IRS Appeals office, FTS is designed to expedite case resolution. Under FTS, taxpayers under examination with issues in dispute work directly with IRS representatives from SB/SE’s Examination Division and Appeals to resolve those issues, with the Appeals representative typically serving as mediator.

The taxpayer or the IRS examination representative may initiate Fast Track for eligible cases, usually before a 30-day letter is issued. The goal is to complete cases within 60 days of acceptance of the application in Appeals.

SB/SE originally launched FTS as a pilot program in September 2006. For more information on taking advantage of the Fast Track Settlement program, please view the short FTS video.

The college and university questionnaire will focus on unrelated business income, endowments and executive compensation practices.  The questionnaires are being sent to a cross-section of small, mid-sized and large private and public four-year colleges and institutions.

Private nonprofit universities are generally exempt from tax under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) and like state universities are subject to unrelated business income tax. 

“This effort reflects our work to build a better understanding of the largest, most complex organizations in the tax-exempt sector,” said Doug Shulman, IRS commissioner.  “The information gathered will help us identify issues and areas that may need more outreach and education or further scrutiny.”

Among other things, the questionnaire will gather information from the schools about how they report revenues and expenses from their trade or business activities, classify their activities as exempt or taxable activities, and calculate and report income or losses on taxable activities.  The questionnaire also will gather information regarding how the organization invests and uses its endowment funds and determines compensation of certain highly paid individuals.

The IRS said it expects to receive most of the responses within the next several months, analyze the results of the compliance questionnaire and conduct examinations of a sample of the organizations.  The IRS said it expects to issue a report on the project in 2009.",0,7.668806628913033
X44B81A16FAE39C,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations to reflect changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on the tax deductibility of officers' compensation by publicly held corporations.

On Aug. 21, 2018, the Treasury Department and IRS released Notice 2018-68PDF. This notice provided initial guidance on this deduction limitation.

Section 162(m) disallows the deduction by any publicly held corporation for compensation paid in any  taxable year to a covered employee that exceeds $1 million. The proposed regulations update the definitions of covered employee, publicly held corporation and applicable employee compensation.

The TCJA also provided a transition, or ""grandfather"" rule, for certain outstanding compensatory arrangements. Specifically, the TCJA changes do not apply to compensation that is provided to a covered employee under a written binding contract that was in effect on Nov. 2, 2017 and was not modified on or after that date. The proposed regulations further explain the grandfather rule, including when a contract will be considered materially modified so that it is no longer considered ""grandfathered."" The TCJA changes apply to tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, except to the extent the grandfather rule applies.

Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations for tax years before the final regulations are effective.

XFD3ACB544E8259,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulationsPDF today on the Foreign Tax Credit, a long-standing tax benefit that generally allows individuals and businesses to claim a credit for income taxes paid or accrued to foreign governments.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made major changes to the tax law, including revamping the U.S. international tax system. Specifically, several Foreign Tax Credit provisions were changed, including repeal of section 902, which allowed deemed-paid credits in connection with dividend distributions based on foreign subsidiaries' cumulative pools of earnings and foreign taxes. TCJA also added two separate limitation categories for foreign branch income and amounts includible under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions.

Additionally, the TCJA changed how taxable income is calculated for purposes of the Foreign Tax Credit limitation by disregarding certain expenses and repealing the use of the fair market value method for allocating interest expense.

Finally, the TCJA made systemic changes to U.S. taxation of international income that impact the Foreign Tax Credit calculation. These systemic changes include the introduction of a participation exemption through a dividends received deduction for certain dividends in section 245A and the introduction of GILTI, which subjects to current U.S. taxation foreign earnings that would have been deferred under previous law, albeit at a lower tax rate and subject to extra Foreign Tax Credit restrictions.

X8DB21D2334EF4D,FCC,"WASHINGTON, December 12, 2018—The Federal Communications Commission today issued a ruling rejecting requests to make it harder for text messaging providers to protect consumers from spam and scam robotexts.  The Commission’s decision makes clear that wireless providers are authorized to continue their efforts to stop unwanted text messaging through robotext-blocking, anti-spoofing measures, and other anti-spam features.  

Text messaging has become a critical communications option for consumers with 1.77 trillion messages exchanged in the United States in 2017.  Wireless messaging has become a trusted form of communication for millions of Americans in large part because wireless providers have taken measures to prevent spam and other unwanted or malicious traffic from clogging consumers’ phones.  As a result of these efforts, wireless messaging remains a relatively spam-free service, with the spam rate for Short Message Service (SMS) estimated at less than 3%.

In today’s ruling, the FCC denies requests from mass-texting companies and other parties to classify text messaging services as “telecommunications services” subject to common carrier regulation under the Communications Act—a classification that would limit wireless providers’ efforts to combat spam and scam robotexts effectively.  Instead, the FCC finds that two forms of wireless messaging services, SMS and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), are “information services” under the Communications Act.  With this decision, the FCC empowers wireless providers to continue taking action to protect American consumers from unwanted text messages. ",3,8.246309268273228
X9E10BFC4AFE462,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service has begun sending letters to taxpayers with virtual currency transactions that potentially failed to report income and pay the resulting tax from virtual currency transactions or did not report their transactions properly.

""Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest and penalties,"" said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. ""The IRS is expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics. We are focused on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations.""

The IRS started sending the educational letters to taxpayers last week. By the end of August, more than 10,000 taxpayers will receive these letters. The names of these taxpayers were obtained through various ongoing IRS compliance efforts.

For taxpayers receiving an educational letter, there are three variations: Letter 6173, Letter 6174 or Letter 6174-A, all three versions strive to help taxpayers understand their tax and filing obligations and how to correct past errors.

Taxpayers are pointed to appropriate information on IRS.gov, including which forms and schedules to use and where to send them.

Last year the IRS announced a Virtual Currency Compliance campaign to address tax noncompliance related to the use of virtual currency through outreach and examinations of taxpayers. The IRS will remain actively engaged in addressing non-compliance related to virtual currency transactions through a variety of efforts, ranging from taxpayer education to audits to criminal investigations.

These final regulations address the definition of real property under section 1031 and also provide a rule addressing the receipt of personal property that is incidental to real property received in a like-kind exchange.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) limited like-kind exchange treatment to exchanges of real property. As of January 1, 2018, exchanges of personal or intangible property such as vehicles, artwork, collectibles, patents, and other intellectual property generally do not qualify for nonrecognition of gain as like-kind exchanges. Also, like-kind exchange treatment applies only to exchanges of real property held for use in a trade or business or for investment. An exchange of real property held primarily for sale does not qualify as a like-kind exchange.

Under the final regulations, real property includes land and generally anything permanently built on or attached to land. In general, real property also includes property that is characterized as real property under applicable State or local law. In addition, certain intangible property, such as leaseholds or easements, qualifies as real property under section 1031. Property not eligible for like-kind exchange treatment prior to enactment of the TCJA remains ineligible. Neither the TCJA nor the final regulations change whether the properties exchanged are of like kind.

To report a like-kind exchange, taxpayers must file Form 8824, Like-Kind Exchanges, with their tax return for the year they transfer property as part of a like-kind exchange. This form helps taxpayers figure the amount of gain deferred as a result of the like-kind exchange, as well as the basis of the like-kind property received. Form 8824 also helps taxpayers compute the amount of gain they must report if cash or property that isn't of a like-kind is involved in the exchange.",0,7.603200390379149

The CAAPDF confirms the U.S. and Malta competent authorities' understanding that (except in the case of a qualified rollover from a pension fund in the same country) a fund, scheme or arrangement is not operated principally to provide pension or retirement benefits if it allows participants to contribute property other than cash, or does not limit contributions by reference to income earned from employment and self-employment activities. Because Maltese personal retirement schemes contain these features, they are not properly treated as a pension fund for Treaty purposes and distributions from these schemes are not pensions or other similar remuneration.

The IRS put taxpayers on notice earlier this year that it was reviewing the use of Maltese personal retirement schemes. The IRS is actively examining taxpayers who have set up these arrangements and recognizes that other taxpayers may have filed tax returns claiming Treaty benefits as a result of their participation in these arrangements. These taxpayers should consult an independent tax advisor prior to filing their 2021 tax returns and take appropriate corrective actions on prior filings.

The IRS also cautions taxpayers against entering into any substantially similar arrangements that would seek to misconstrue the provisions of a bilateral income tax treaty of the United States to avoid income tax. IRS enforcement, both the civil and criminal divisions, is committed to pursuing abuse and those who market and participate in abusive transactions.",0,11.532135268231887
X685FA88DE6493A,IRS,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service issued a temporary regulation and a proposed regulation to reconcile advance payments of refundable employment tax credits and recapture the benefit of these credits when necessary.

The regulations authorize the assessment of erroneous refunds of the credits paid under both the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Families First Act) and Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).

The Families First Act generally requires employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide paid sick leave for up to 80 hours and paid family leave for up to 10 weeks if the employee is unable to work or telework due to COVID-19 related reasons. Eligible employers are entitled to fully refundable tax credits to cover the cost of the leave required to be paid.

The CARES Act provides an additional credit for employers experiencing economic hardship due to COVID-19. Eligible employers who pay qualified wagesto their employees are entitled to an employee retention credit.

The IRS has revised or is in the process of revising the Form 941, Form 943, Form 944 and Form CT-1, so that employers may use these returns to claim the paid sick and family leave and employee retention credits.

Employers may also receive advance payment of the credits up to the total allowable amounts. The IRS has created Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due To COVID-19, which employers may use to request an advance of the credits. Employers are required to reconcile any advance payments claimed on Form 7200 with total credits claimed and total taxes due on their employment tax returns.

Any refund of these credits paid to a taxpayer that exceeds the amount the taxpayer is allowed is an erroneous refund. The regulations released today authorize the assessment and collection of any erroneous refund of the credits in the normal course of processing the applicable employment tax returns or Forms 7200. This allows the IRS to efficiently recover any refund, while preserving administrative protections for taxpayers.",0,11.87932133530811
XDC4FF7183A1792,IRS,"WASHINGTON — With millions of Americans now receiving taxable unemployment compensation, many of them for the first time, the Internal Revenue Service today reminded people receiving unemployment compensation that they can have tax withheld from their benefits now to help avoid owing taxes on this income when they file their federal income tax return next year.

By law, unemployment compensation is taxable and must be reported on a 2020 federal income tax return. Taxable benefits include any of the special unemployment compensation authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, enacted this spring.

Withholding is voluntary. Federal law allows any recipient to choose to have a flat 10% withheld from their benefits to cover part or all of their tax liability. To do that, fill out Form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding RequestPDF, and give it to the agency paying the benefits. Don't send it to the IRS. If the payor has its own withholding request form, use it instead.

If a recipient doesn't choose withholding, or if withholding is not enough, they can make quarterly estimated tax payments instead. The payment for the first two quarters of 2020 was due on July 15. Third and fourth quarter payments are due on September 15, 2020, and January 15, 2021, respectively.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires certain taxpayers that have untaxed foreign earnings and profits to pay a tax as if those earnings and profits have been repatriated to the‎ United States. The law provides details on the income that must be recognized. It also provides a related deduction which generally lowers the effective tax rate to between 8% and 15.5%.

X7F660A50DCDEED,OSHA,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FL – Federal workplace safety inspectors examining how a 26-year-old diver drowned in a golf course pond – after only three days working for a Freming Island commercial diving and recovery company – found the employer failed to follow required safety standards, including ensuring adequate supervision was in place and that required training was provided.

The December 2021 incident occurred as the dive technician and a coworker employed by Ballhawker of Florida Inc. recovered sunken golf balls in a pond on a Ponte Vedra Beach golf course. When the diver became unresponsive, the coworker pulled him from the water and asked a passing golfer to call 911. The diver was transported to a local hospital where he later died.

Following an investigation, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued citations to Ballhawker for 12 serious violations. OSHA found the company failed to:

Train divers to handle assigned tasks safely, including using equipment.
Ensure all dive team members are CPR trained.
Provide a first-aid handbook or a resuscitator at the dive location.
Provide continuous monitoring and oversee diving operations.
Inspect diving equipment and components prior to every dive.
Test air compressor systems for air purity every six months.
Use diver depth gauges.
Set up an operational communication system among all dive team members.
Comply with pre-dive requirements prior to operations.
Develop and maintain a safe practice manual for divers.
Inspectors found that Ballhawker also failed to keep records of workers and job details, including a designated person-in-charge; the date, time and location of the job; and water and surface conditions.

OSHA proposed $55,870 in penalties.

“Ballhawker ignored safety standards and a young man lost his life,” said OSHA Acting Area Office Director Erin Sanchez in Jacksonville, Florida. “Commercial divers are exposed to a variety of hazards, and it is an employer's responsibility to not start a dive until it is safe.” 

The company has 15 business days from receipt of their citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.",5,4.71758215732833
X27C76F9EDB89C6,OSHA,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Bacardi Bottling Corp. with 12 alleged safety violations following the death of a 21-year-old temporary worker his first day on the job. Lawrence Daquan ""Day"" Davis was crushed to death by a palletizer machine at the Jacksonville facility in August 2012. The company uses Remedy Intelligent Staffing as a temporary staffing service to provide laborers for certain types of jobs.
""A worker's first day at work shouldn't be his last day on earth,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers are responsible for ensuring the safe conditions of all their employees, including those who are temporary.""
OSHA requires that employers protect the health and safety of all workers under their supervision and control. Davis was cleaning glass from under the hoist of a palletizing machine when an employee restarted the palletizer. Bacardi Bottling had failed to train temporary employees on utilizing locks and tags to prevent the accidental start-up of machines and to ensure its own employees utilized procedures to lock or tag out machines.
Two willful citations have been issued for failing to develop, document and utilize lockout/tagout procedures for the control of potentially hazardous energy and train temporary workers on lockout/tagout procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.
""We are seeing untrained workers - many of them temporary workers - killed very soon after starting a new job. This must stop,"" said Michaels. ""Employers must train all employees, including temporary workers, on the hazards specific to that workplace - before they start working. Had Bacardi done so, this tragic loss of life could have been prevented.""
Also cited are nine serious violations for exposing workers to trips, struck-by and fire hazards where fixed permanent conveyors crossed through the aisle; obstructing exit routes; exposing workers to falling bottles and debris from overhead conveyors and electrical shock hazards. The employer also failed to provide an adequate number of lockout/tagout devices to perform lockout/tagout procedures of energy sources on various equipment, conduct an adequate periodic review of the energy control procedures, perform servicing and maintenance on machines and equipment without training in the methods and means for energy isolation, and require workers to wear safety goggles and long sleeves when using air guns at 90 pounds per square inch. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.
One other-than-serious violation has been cited for storing a mixing tank within 12 inches of the electrical panel box. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.
Proposed penalties for the willful and serious violations total $192,000. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/BacardiBottlingCorp_584358_0208_13.pdf*.

""Removing guards and failing to train workers in proper lockout procedures is inexcusable,"" said Judy Freeman, OSHA's area director in Wichita. ""Tyson Foods failed to ensure safety procedures, demonstrating a lack of commitment to workplace safety and health and resulting in a tragic injury.""
OSHA began its inspection upon learning of the amputation, which occurred June 17 when four workers were cleaning conveyor equipment at the end of their shift. Guarding on the conveyor was removed, exposing workers to rotating parts. A worker's frock and the employee's arm were then pulled into moving gears of a conveyor that had not been locked out to prevent unintentional operation. Two willful violations involve failing to train workers on lockout/tagout procedures and to lock out equipment to prevent the unintentional operation of equipment and exposure to amputation hazards. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement, or with plain indifference to employee safety and health.
One serious violation involves fall hazards when workers ascend the upper platform work area in two separate plant locations. The company failed to provide fixed stairs to reach the work areas. An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known existed.

XF37219725FF439,OSHA,"TINTON FALLS, NJ - A federal workplace safety and health investigation found numerous violations at a Tinton Falls transitional housing facility where 11 employees and 28 residents tested positive for the coronavirus by late March.
In response to a complaint, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration discovered that while Seaside Guest Services' continuity of operations plan required that residents with coronavirus be isolated and workers notified, neither happened. Additionally, OSHA inspectors determined the facility provided protective masks to its employees, but did not enforce their use. Seaside also failed to enforce social distancing despite posting signs in its four housing units.
OSHA cited the facility's operator, AMA Health Holdings LLC, with two citations for failing to develop and implement effective measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and not recording each work-related illness. The agency proposed $10,923 in penalties.
""Seaside Guest Services' failure to isolate workers from infected residents, and enforce its own mask and social distancing policies is difficult to comprehend,"" said OSHA Area Director Paula Dixon-Roderick in Marlton. ""Their neglect exposed workers and others to the coronavirus, and raised the possibility that 11 workers were infected as a result.""
Seaside Guest Services provides transitional housing for people attending area behavioral-health programs and those who have completed some level of addiction treatment.

X13A177F8FBA1EA,OSHA,"CHICAGO ‚ Nearly one in 10 people endure noise levels at work loud enough to cause hearing loss while seven in 10 experience moderately loud noise levels, reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet, the bureau's Occupational Requirements Survey, published in 2019, found that more than half of the nation's manufacturing workers reported not using personal protective equipment to protect their hearing.
To reduce these workplace dangers and promote hearing conservation programs, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration regional office in Chicago has established a Regional Emphasis Program to raise awareness among Midwest manufacturing employers.
By law, OSHA requires employers to implement a hearing conservation program when the average noise exposure over eight working hours reaches or exceeds 85 decibels, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compares to the sound of city traffic (from inside the vehicle) or a gas-powered leaf blower. To prevent noise-induced hearing loss, OSHA provides employers with hearing conservation guidelines.
The REP's initial phase will include informational mailings to employers, professional associations, local safety councils, apprenticeship programs, local hospitals and occupational health clinics, and OSHA presentations to industry organizations and stakeholders. OSHA will also encourage employers to use the agency's free consultation services to help them implement noise safety strategies and ensure compliance with OSHA standards.
""Earning a living should not come at the expense of hearing loss,"" said OSHA Acting Regional Administrator William Donovan in Chicago. ""Hearing conservation programs are designed to prevent workplace hearing loss, protect remaining hearing, and provide employers and workers with the knowledge and equipment to control and reduce exposure to noise.""
OSHA encourages employers to take steps to identify, reduce and eliminate hazards related to high levels of noise during the REP's initial phase. Following its three-month outreach, that began June 1, 2021, the REP empowers OSHA to schedule and inspect select manufacturing industries in Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin with hearing loss rates higher than the national average.",5,6.105984669515334

Film Allman LLC of Pasadena, California, was cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for one willful and one serious safety violation for exposing employees to struck-by and fall hazards.
""Employers are responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect workers' health and safety, and the entertainment industry is no exception,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""It is unacceptable that Film Allman LLC knowingly exposed their crew to moving trains while filming on a live track and railroad trestle.""
OSHA initiated the inspection in response to the incident, which occurred during the filming of a scene on the tracks of the Doctortown train trestle in Georgia that spans the Altamaha River. While the crew was filming, a CSX Corp. train traveling on the tracks was observed heading toward them. Crew members immediately started exiting the tracks, trying to remove set pieces and get off the trestle. However, they were unable to outrun the oncoming train. Ms. Jones was killed and eight other crew members were injured by debris when the train hit a hospital bed being used as a set piece.
""Their failure to develop a safety plan to prevent such hazards, including obtaining permission from the rail owner to use the tracks for filming, led to the death of one crew member and injuries to eight other employees,"" said Kurt Petermeyer, OSHA's Regional Administrator for the Southeast.
A willful citation was issued for the employer's failure to provide safety measures to protect employees from moving trains. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.
The serious citation was issued for exposing workers to fall hazards while working on a train trestle that was not equipped with safety guardrails or other fall protection measures. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, fatal work injuries in Georgia accounted for 101 of the 4,628 fatal work injuries* reported in 2012. Additional details are available at http://www.bls.gov.

XA4275C5292265D,OSHA,"TECUMSEH, Neb. - Following the death of a truck driver at Midwest Farmers Cooperative's grain handling facility in Tecumseh, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited the company for 12 serious safety violations. The driver, who was not provided a respirator or personal protective clothing, was overcome by anhydrous ammonia vapors while transferring the liquid from a semitruck to bulk storage tanks. In the lungs, liquid anhydrous ammonia causes destruction of delicate respiratory tissue. Exposure to ammonia vapor may cause convulsive coughing, difficult or painful breathing, congestion and death. The worker later died at the hospital from complications related to the ammonia inhalation. Three other workers were injured.
On March 20, a 250-gallon water-bleeder tank ruptured, releasing anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere and exposing the 63-year-old driver, who had worked at the facility for more than 10 years, to an ammonia vapor cloud. A second employee of Midwest Farmers Cooperative walked into the cloud and was treated and released from a local medical facility. An employee of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, who was performing maintenance on the adjacent railroad tracks, and a deputy sheriff responding to the scene, were also exposed, requiring medical evaluation.
""Midwest Farmers Cooperative and other employers using this common farm fertilizer must recognize the hazards their employees face as they transport, store and transfer anhydrous ammonia,"" said Bonita Winingham, OSHA's area director in Omaha. ""With the growing season in full swing, employers must train their workers to handle these chemicals properly and to protect against exposure to ammonia vapors.""
The Tecumseh grain-handling facility stores and sells corn, wheat and soybeans. The facility has an anhydrous ammonia storage capacity of 400,000 pounds. The cooperative sells the ammonia to area farmers.
Because of the investigation, OSHA cited Midwest Farmers Cooperative with 12 serious violations. Several violations involved OSHA's Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia Standards, such as failing to provide an ammonia control system; provide employees with chemically impervious clothing; inspect and maintain ammonia equipment and piping to prevent potential leaks and system failure; and develop and train workers in an emergency response plan. The company was cited for storing the chemical in tanks located within 100 feet of a mainline railroad track.
Other violations involved respiratory protection standards, such as failing to ensure self-contained breathing apparatus and atmospheric monitoring equipment were provided and used for response to an emergency, as well as for failing to medically evaluate and fit test workers required to use respirators.
An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known exists.
OSHA has proposed penalties of $62,101.
Greenwood Farmers Cooperative merged with Waverly Farmers Cooperative in January 2014 and operates as Midwest Farmers Cooperative. Before this inspection, the company was previously cited by OSHA twice in 2011, resulting in the issuance of eight citations.

In 1973, OSHA established Part 1977 - Discrimination against Employees under OSH Act of 1970 that contains interpretive regulations and procedures governing the agency's administration of cases under section 11(c), which prohibits employers from retaliating against employees because they have engaged in protected activity, including complaining about unsafe or unhealthful working conditions.

The revised final interpretive rule clarifies the causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action (29 CFR 1977.6). This change brings the provision in line with the Supreme Court's holdings in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, and Bostock v. Clay County, Georgia. The agency also revised the regulation by adding terms to reflect the full scope of section 11(c)'s prohibition against retaliation.

The action marks the department’s latest step to ensure the availability of respirators and follows President Donald J. Trump’s Memorandum on Making General Use Respirators Available.

Due to the impact on workplace conditions caused by limited supplies of N95 FFRs, employers should reassess their engineering controls, work practices and administrative controls to identify any changes they can make to decrease the need for N95 respirators.

If respiratory protection must be used, employers may consider use of alternative classes of respirators that provide equal or greater protection compared to an N95 FFR, such as National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved, non-disposable, elastomeric respirators or powered, air-purifying respirators. 

When these alternatives are not available, or where their use creates additional safety or health hazards, employers may consider the extended use or reuse of N95 FFRs, or use of N95 FFRs that were approved but have since passed the manufacturer’s recommended shelf life, under specified conditions.

This interim guidance will take effect immediately and remain in effect until further notice. This guidance is intended to be time-limited to the current public health crisis. Visit OSHA’s Coronavirus webpage regularly for updates.

Michael A. Sandoval pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion, one count of aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false tax return, and one count of making and subscribing a false tax return.

According to documents filed with the court, Sandoval provided payroll and tax preparation services for individuals and companies through his Las Vegas business Nevada Financial Solutions Inc. (NFS). Sandoval used NFS to commit multiple tax crimes. First, when two of his clients provided NFS with $471,178 in payments to be forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as money due for their quarterly employment taxes, Sandoval did not provide those payments to the IRS, but instead spent the funds for his personal benefit. Second, Sandoval filed and caused the filing of false individual income tax returns for a substantial number of clients by reporting fraudulent deductions, including false Schedule C business losses and charitable contribution and state and local tax deductions. These fraudulent deductions caused a tax loss of over $2.8 million. Lastly, Sandoval fraudulently understated his income from NFS on his individual income tax returns for the years 2010 through 2017, causing an additional tax loss of $100,138. In total, Sandoval caused a tax loss totaling $3,425,654.

XE631E597DBE787,DOJ,"The Department of Justice today advised the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that while it should not accept the class action settlement in The Authors Guild Inc. et al. v. Google Inc. as proposed due to concerns of the United States regarding class action, copyright and antitrust law, the parties should be encouraged to continue their productive discussions to address those concerns. In its statement of interest filed with the court, the Department stated:

""Given the parties’ express commitment to ongoing discussions to address concerns already raised and the possibility that such discussions could lead to a settlement agreement that could legally be approved by the Court, the public interest would best be served by direction from the Court encouraging the continuation of those discussions between the parties and, if the Court so chooses, by some direction as to those aspects of the Proposed Settlement that need to be improved. Because a properly structured settlement agreement in this case offers the potential for important societal benefits, the United States does not want the opportunity or momentum to be lost.""

In its filing, the Department proposed that the parties consider a number of changes to the agreement that may help address the United States’ concerns, including imposing limitations on the most open-ended provisions for future licensing, eliminating potential conflicts among class members, providing additional protections for unknown rights holders, addressing the concerns of foreign authors and publishers, eliminating the joint-pricing mechanisms among publishers and authors, and, whatever the settlement’s ultimate scope, providing some mechanism by which Google’s competitors can gain comparable access.

The settlement agreement between Google and the authors and publishers aims to resolve copyright infringement claims brought against Google by the Authors Guild and five major publishers in 2005 raised by Google’s efforts to digitally scan books contained in several libraries and make them searchable on the Internet. The District Court’s hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled to take place on October 7, 2009.",6,12.547444080140858
X749B1D568E879E,DOJ,"The Justice Department today announced a settlement of its race discrimination lawsuit against Guaranteed Auto Sales, a used car dealership in Glen Burnie, Maryland.  The agreement also settles the United States’ claims against the dealership’s owner and manager, Kelly Ann West and Robert Chesgreen.

The settlement resolves claims that Guaranteed Auto Sales discriminated against African Americans in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by offering different terms of credit based on race to those seeking to purchase and finance used cars. The agreement, which is subject to court approval, was filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.

The settlement requires the dealership to implement a number of specific practices to ensure that loan terms are offered to customers on a nondiscriminatory basis. Specifically, defendants will develop written policies to govern financing decisions, including how down payment amounts are calculated and whether the down payments may be made in more than one installment; post and distribute nondiscrimination notices to potential purchasers; attend training on the requirements of the Equal Opportunity Act; and engage in ongoing record keeping and reporting to the United States. 

“When people borrow money to buy a car, a house, or anything else, they have a right to be treated fairly and without regard to their race,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “The U.S. Department of Justice will not tolerate anyone who discriminates against people because of their race in deciding whether, and under what conditions, to lend them money. Our common humanity, our nation’s sense of decency, and federal law make this kind of race discrimination both un-American and illegal. Today’s settlement should send a clear message that car dealerships and other lenders must never make credit decisions based on a customer’s race. By entering into this agreement, the defendants have committed to take the steps necessary to ensure that they will provide equal treatment for borrowers of all races.”

This lawsuit, filed in September 2019, was based on the results of testing conducted by the department’s Fair Housing Testing Program, in which individuals pose as prospective car buyers to gather information about possible discriminatory practices. The complaint alleged that employees of Guaranteed Auto Sales told African American testers that they needed larger down payments than white testers for the same used cars, and told African American testers that they were required to fund their down payments in one lump sum, while they gave white testers an option of paying in two installments.",5,12.691159070965405
XE5DD945109A55A,DOJ,"The Department of Justice today announced that Amtrak paid over $2 million to more than 1,500 individuals who experienced disability discrimination while traveling or attempting to travel by train. The payments were part of a comprehensive settlement agreement reached on Dec. 2, 2020, to resolve the United States’ determination that Amtrak failed for over a decade to make existing stations in its intercity rail transportation system accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The payments follow a year-long process to identify victims of that discrimination.

“As a result of the Justice Department’s efforts, more than 1,500 people with disabilities harmed by Amtrak’s inaccessible rail stations are receiving compensation for the discrimination they experienced,” said Assistant Attorney Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “These payments, as well as Amtrak’s ongoing efforts to make rail stations accessible pursuant to our settlement agreement, bring both Amtrak and our nation one step closer to realizing the ADA’s promise of equal opportunity for people with disabilities.”

The December 2020 agreement requires Amtrak to make its intercity rail system accessible, prioritizing stations with the most significant barriers to access. In the next nine years, Amtrak is required to complete designs to make at least 135 of its existing stations accessible, complete construction at 90 of those stations, and begin construction at 45 more. Amtrak will also train staff on ADA requirements and implement an improved process for accepting and handling ADA complaints.

X7EC7425722F566,DOJ,"On Saturday, the President by Executive Order formally established an interagency committee to advise the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on national security and law enforcement concerns related to certain license applications by companies under foreign ownership or control.  The Attorney General will chair the committee, which includes the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense. 

Saturday’s Executive Order, “Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector,” formalizes a process known as Team Telecom that has existed for years, but which will benefit from a transparent and empowered structure.

“In the digital age, our telecommunications networks are more important than ever, and not just to the economy,” said Attorney General William P. Barr.  “This is a national security and public safety issue.  That’s why the federal government must be vigilant and ensure that a foreign adversary cannot undermine the networks our country depends on.”

The Justice Department’s National Security Division, through its Foreign Investment Review Section, will represent the Attorney General on the Committee.  Other departments and agencies will serve as Advisors to the Committee. 

“We look forward to continuing to work with our federal partners to ensure that our nation’s telecommunications networks maintain the security, integrity, and continuity that the American people expect and American security demands,” said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “We welcome foreign participation in our communications system, but we must ensure that anyone licensed to do business here is a trusted partner.  The National Security Division is ready and proud to lead this effort to increase transparency to the public, certainty and timeliness for the business community, and security for the nation.” 

The Committee will review applications for telecommunications, submarine cable landing, and other FCC licenses which the FCC refers for review of national security and law enforcement concerns.  Under the Executive Order, once an application is deemed complete, the Committee must complete an initial review of an application within 120 days, and if a review reveals potential risks, must complete a secondary assessment within 90 days. Even complex applications would be reviewed within about a year, substantially faster than Team Telecom has functioned historically.  The EO also establishes a framework for Advisors to the Committee to contribute to the process, ensuring that the FCC receives a timely recommendation that reflects a coordinated Executive Branch view.  Those recommendations will continue to be filed on the FCC’s public docket, and the FCC will continue to make the final decision on the disposition of any application.",6,10.618445164355501
X8F129FE6EABEE1,EEOC,"HUNTINGTON, W.V. - CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) will pay $3.2 million and furnish other relief to settle a company-wide sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.

According to the EEOC's lawsuit, CSXT conducted isokinetic strength testing as a requirement for workers to be hired for various jobs. The EEOC said that the strength test used by CSXT, known as the ""IPCS Biodex"" test, caused an unlawful discriminatory impact on female workers seeking jobs as conductors, material handler/clerks, and a number of other job categories. The EEOC also charged that CSXT used two other employment tests, a three-minute step test seeking to measure aerobic capacity and a discontinued arm endurance test, as a requirement for selection into certain jobs, and that those tests also caused an unlawful discriminatory effect on female workers.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, including the use of tests that are administered to all applicants and employees regardless of sex but that cause a discriminatory effect or impact on persons of a particular sex or any other demographic category. Employers using such tests must prove that those practices are necessary for safe and efficient performance of the specific jobs for which the tests are used. Even if this necessity is proven, such tests are prohibited by Title VII if it is shown that there are alternative practices that can achieve the employers' objectives but have a less discriminatory effect.

The EEOC originally filed the lawsuit (U.S. EEOC v. CSX Transportation, Inc. Case No. 3:17-cv-03731) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Huntington on Aug. 1, 2017. The EEOC and CSXT agreed to settle the EEOC's disparate impact claims before any ruling by the federal court. The EEOC did not allege any intentional discrimination by CSXT in this case.

The consent decree settling the EEOC's lawsuit, which has received approval by the federal court, requires CSXT to cease the physical abilities testing practices that the EEOC charged were causing a disparate impact against female workers. The decree also requires CSXT to pay $3.2 million into a settlement fund to pay lost wages and benefits to a class of women in over 20 states who were denied positions because of the testing. Under the decree, CSXT must also retain expert consultants to conduct scientific studies before adopting certain types of physical abilities testing programs for use in its hiring.

""We commend CSX Transportation for working collaboratively with the EEOC to address our concerns about the railroad's physical abilities testing program,"" said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence. ""The company's willingness to confer with the EEOC about the agency's concerns and its agreement to cease the testing practices at issue reflect a corporate commitment to gender diversity and inclusion that will benefit both workers and the company.""

EEOC Pittsburgh Area Office Director Roosevelt Bryant said, ""Railroad and other transportation occupations provide excellent career opportunities for women when sex-based barriers to their participation in those jobs are removed. The EEOC is committed to ensuring that all workers have an equal opportunity for hiring and advancement in such work.""

EEOC District Director Jamie R. Williamson said, ""The EEOC will continue to carefully examine employer testing and screening practices to identify those that operate as systemic barriers to employment based on protected characteristics. Workers who believe they are being subjected to the discriminatory effects of such practices should bring them to the attention of the EEOC.""

Eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring, especially class-based recruitment and hiring practices that discriminate against racial, ethnic and religious groups, older workers, women and persons with disabilities, is one of six national priorities identified by the Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan.

According to company information, CSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries based in Jacksonville, Fla., is one of the nation's leading transportation suppliers. CSX's principal operating company, CSX Transportation, provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 route-mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. CSX serves more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. CSX also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through connections to more than 240 short line and regional railroads.

X4A7D8F8C4A25C2,EEOC,"PHILADELPHIA – The nation's largest rail carrier paid a human resources regional director less money because of her sex and then unlawfully retaliated against her when she complained about the wage discrimination, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it announced today.

The EEOC charged that beginning in 2001, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, also known as Amtrak, discriminated against Sheila Davidson in her compensation and work assignments because of her sex. The EEOC said that Amtrak paid Davidson, a human resources manager assigned to the rail carrier's 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, the same salary as it paid two male human resources regional directors, even though Davidson had more relevant experience and was assigned a far greater workload than her male counterparts.

The pattern of sex discrimination against Davidson continues to have a negative affect on her compensation and benefits even after she was laterally transferred to the position of director of work force planning in 2006, the EEOC said in its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-00692.

The EEOC also charged that Amtrak violated Title VII and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by unlawfully retaliating against Davidson because she complained about the wage discrimination and filed a charge with the EEOC. The retaliation includes barring Davidson from participating in senior staff meetings, the EEOC said.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation and other terms and conditions of employment based on sex. Both Title VII and the Equal Pay Act prohibit employers from retaliating against an employee who complains about pay discrimination or files a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.

The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. In its lawsuit, the EEOC seeks injunctive relief prohibiting discriminatory practices based on sex or retaliation, as well as lost wages and compensatory and punitive damages for Davidson and other affirmative relief.

""As a member agency of the President's Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force, the EEOC is committed to strong enforcement of the equal pay laws,"" said Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., director of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office, which oversees Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New Jersey and Ohio. ""Employers should be on notice that they will be held accountable if they engage in wage discrimination based on sex or if they punish employees who exercise their federal right to complain about sex-based wage disparities.""

EEOC Regional Attorney Debra Lawrence added, ""Denying Davidson a salary commensurate with her greater workload not only showed bad business judgment, it also constituted a violation of federal law. We hope this lawsuit reminds all employers to review their compensation policies and practices to make sure they are not engaging in unlawful wage discrimination.""

In Fiscal Year 2010, private sector workplace discrimination charge filings with the EEOC hit an unprecedented level of 99,922, which included a record-high number of retaliation charges (36,258) and sex discrimination charges (29,029).",5,9.415210585068225
X1B5E379BACD7EE,EEOC,"PHILADELPHIA – Gas Field Specialists, Inc. (GFS), a Potter County, Pennsylvania-based natural gas well service company, will pay $184,000 and provide significant injunctive and other non-monetary relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.

According to the EEOC’s lawsuit, an employee who had been with the company for 15 years was laid off and then terminated based on a disability or record of disability. The EEOC contended that GFS fired the employee because he had a history of cancer. The suit further alleges that an owner of the company told the employee that the company didn’t want him to get sick with COVID-19 and had to lay off anyone with health issues during the COVID pandemic.

Such alleged conduct violates the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits employers from making employment decisions based on disability, or subjecting employees to disparate terms and conditions of employment and/or a hostile work environment, layoff, termination or forcing an employee to quit, based on a real or perceived disability or history of disability.

The consent decree settling the suit requires that GFS pay the employee $174,000 in lost wages and $10,000 in compensatory damages. It also enjoins GFS from violating the ADA in the future, including from taking adverse actions against employees on the basis that they have health conditions that could expose them to a higher risk of health complications were they to contract COVID-19. The decree also requires GFS to document its reasons whenever employees are not recalled from seasonal layoff. The company will also provide training on the ADA to its managers and human resources staff.  

In addition, GFS must provide reports to the EEOC detailing its compliance with terms of the decree and its receipt of any complaints of disability discrimination. The court will retain authority to enforce the terms of the decree for its three-year duration.

“Employers have an obligation to make personnel decisions without regard to employees’ medical history,” said Philadelphia District Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence. “The unlawful employment practices, in this case, are unacceptable in our nation’s workplaces. This monetary settlement is an affirmation of who we are and what we believe as a country: that workplace discrimination is unacceptable and illegal.”

Philadelphia District Director Jamie R. Williamson stated, “Many employees diagnosed with cancer choose to work through their condition -- because, after all, they still have to make ends meet. This employee lost his job because this employer failed to provide full inclusion for people with disabilities.”  ",5,7.662107412717585
X487B5F4C5AA125,EEOC,"DALLAS – The EEOC filed two lawsuits in Texas courts today, alleging that a pharmacy in Fabens and a coffeehouse in Ft. Worth both discriminated against employees with disabilities that rendered them vulnerable to serious illness if they contracted COVID-19. The two employers took different approaches to the virus, but both ran afoul of the ADA.

According to the EEOC’s suit against U.S. Drug Mart d/b/a Fabens Pharmacy, the pharmacy discriminated against a pharmacy technician with asthma who asked to wear a facemask at work as an accommodation of his disability immediately following the COVID-19 outbreak to help protect him from the virus. The employee was harassed because he requested this accommodation and was sent home twice when he asked to wear a mask, and then taunted and humiliated for questioning management’s policy prohibiting masks, leading him to quit, according to the suit.

In this case, the EEOC seeks back pay, compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.

EEOC filed suit in Ft. Worth against 151 Coffee, LLC alleging that the company violated the ADA by denying reasonable accommodation to two baristas with disabilities and terminating their employment. According to the EEOC’s complaint, the employees were not allowed to return to work until a vaccine for COVID-19 was developed, even though they were ready and willing to work.

“The employers in this case took actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that had the effect of discriminating against disabled employees in violation of the ADA,” said Meaghan Kuelbs, senior trial attorney for the EEOC. “Employees cannot be refused the opportunity to work just because their employer believes it is protecting them from illness. Absent a direct threat to the safety of themselves or others, employers cannot deny employment opportunities based on disability.”

X7DA362267E5C15,EEOC,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) updated its COVID-19 technical assistance today to include more information about employer retaliation in pandemic-related employment situations.

The updates explain and clarify the rights of employees and job applicants who believe they suffered retaliation for protected activities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, or other employment discrimination laws. The technical assistance explains how these rights are balanced against employers’ needs to enforce COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

“Retaliation is the most frequently alleged form of discrimination in the EEOC’s charges overall and has been at the top for too many years,” said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows. “The COVID-19 pandemic has created new situations and additional challenges, but it is no excuse to retaliate against people for opposing employment discrimination. This updated technical assistance provides additional clarity on how our laws balance workers’ rights to speak up without fear of retaliation against employers’ responsibilities to create a healthy and safe work environment.”

    Key updates include:

Job applicants and current and former employees are protected from retaliation by employers for asserting their rights under any of the  EEOC-enforced anti-discrimination laws.  
Protected activity can take many forms, including filing a charge of discrimination; complaining to a supervisor about coworker harassment; or requesting accommodation of a disability or a religious belief, practice, or observance, regardless of whether the request is granted or denied.
Additionally, the ADA prohibits not only retaliation for protected EEO activity, but also “interference” with an individual’s exercise of ADA rights. 
This updated technical assistance also supports the EEOC’s participation in an interagency initiative, which will be launched today, to end retaliation against workers who exercise their protected labor and employment law rights. The other participants in the initiative are the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The initiative will include collaboration among these civil law enforcement agencies to protect workers on issues of unlawful retaliatory conduct, educate the public and engage with employers, business organizations, labor organizations and civil rights groups in the coming year.

According to the EEOC's suit, B. Fehr, LLC, doing business as Golden Corral, terminated Alicea Cruce in May 2016 because it accused her of being unwilling or unable to control her disability.

Discriminating against an employee due to a disability or perceived disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which protects individuals from discrimination based on their disability.

""An employer cannot fire an employee because of her disability - or its misperception of it,"" said Antonette Sewell, regional attorney for the EEOC's Atlanta District Office. ""Ms. Cruce's condition in no way prevented her from performing her job, yet her employer fired her out of fear for her condition. Such conduct violates the ADA.""

Charter granted the request, but only for about a month. The employee requested an extension, but Charter refused to grant it. After the accommodation expired, Charter, without consulting with the employee about needing further accommodation, moved him back to the shift ending at 9:00 p.m.

""The ADA requires employers to accommodate disabled employees who are qualified to do their jobs,"" said Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC's Chicago District.

This NPRM is available in the reading room of the Federal Register today. The USPTO invites the public to provide comments on the proposed rule on or before December 23.

The NPRM proposes that a petitioner bears the burden to show the unpatentability of substitute claims proposed in a motion to amend; a patent owner bears the burden to show that a motion to amend complies with certain statutory and regulatory requirements; and the Board may, in the interests of justice, make a determination regarding the patentability of substitute claims based on the record in the proceeding regardless of the burdens assigned to any party.",6,12.652623879246848
XB3A62CC70F4EFB,USPTO,"The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) today provided notice of an update to the 2019 Revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Guidance (2019 PEG).

The October 2019 Update responds to public comments regarding the 2019 PEG. The update does not change the 2019 PEG, but provides further explanation on how the USPTO applies such guidance. For example, the update provides additional information on how the USPTO determines if a claim “recites” an abstract idea and how groupings within the abstract idea exception are determined. It also explains the procedures examiners can use to identify “tentative abstract ideas” and provides more information on how examiners evaluate whether a judicial exception is integrated into a practical application. The update also addresses the examiner’s responsibility to provide adequate notice to applicants in making a subject matter eligibility rejection. In addition to the written explanations described above, the update includes additional helpful examples in the life sciences and data processing areas. It also includes an updated index of examples for use with the 2019 PEG and an updated case law chart that lists selected eligibility cases from the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The October 2019 Update materials are available to the public on the Subject Matter Eligibility page of the USPTO website. Feedback on the update or on any patent eligibility issue is welcome on an ongoing basis.

There is no cost for appeals related to COVID-19 in this pilot program, which starts on April 15, 2021.

A COVID-related appeal for eligibility into the pilot program must relate to a product or process that is subject to an applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for COVID-19 use.

Petition grants for fast-track review of COVID-related ex parte appeals will be limited to a maximum of 500, and the USPTO has a goal to issue a decision for these appeals within six months of entry into the pilot program. In order to keep appeals on schedule, oral hearings under the program will be expedited and, once scheduled, will not be rescheduled or relocated.

XCE50930DBF907E,USPTO,"Washington — The U.S. Department of Commerce’s United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and Brazil’s National Institute for Industrial Property (INPI) agreed to establish a Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) pilot program. The pilot program will reduce patent workloads and further improve patent quality.

PPH agreements are cooperative initiatives that streamline the patent examination process by promoting expeditious, less costly, and more effective patent protection. The USPTO and INPI plan to launch the two-year pilot program on January 11, 2016.

“This agreement strengthens the economic relationship between the United States and Brazil and further highlights the commitment both countries have made to provide a high quality and efficient intellectual property system that will make it easier for innovators of all sizes to do business in a global economy.” said Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO Michelle K. Lee.

The PPH is an international cooperative framework that provides for fast-track examination of patent applications in participating patent offices.  Pursuant to the program, an applicant receiving a favorable ruling on patentability from one office may request that the other participating office expedite the examination of a commonly filed application.  By leveraging each office’s work products, participating offices can accelerate processing and improve patent quality, which in turn allows applicants to obtain higher quality patents in multiple jurisdictions with significant savings in terms of time and money.

This new PPH pilot program is the centerpiece of the June 2015 U.S.-Brazil Commercial Dialogue Joint Statement on Patent Work Sharing signed by Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Brazilian Minister of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, Armando Monteiro.  The program complements efforts already under way in both Brazil and the United States to reduce patent backlogs and shorten patent pendency — the time between filing a patent application and its grant — by leveraging the patent expertise and work product of patent examiners at both national patent offices.

Today’s action is part of Treasury’s continued effort to counter attempts to circumvent these sanctions.  The United States remains steadfast in our commitment to maintain sanctions until Russia fully implements its commitments under the Minsk agreements. This action underscores the U.S. government’s opposition to Russia’s occupation of Crimea and our firm refusal to recognize its attempted annexation of the peninsula.  These sanctions follow the European Union’s extension on Monday of sanctions and reinforce our continued unity in supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 
As a result of today’s action, any property or interest in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked.  Additionally, transactions by U.S. persons involving these persons, or the vessels identified as blocked, are generally prohibited. 
 
“Today’s action is in response to Russia’s unlawful occupation of Crimea and continued aggression in Ukraine,” said John E. Smith, Acting OFAC Director.  “These targeted sanctions aim to maintain pressure on Russia by sustaining the costs of its occupation of Crimea and disrupting the activities of those who support the violence and instability in Ukraine.”

Seven of these individuals were also designated yesterday by the European Union (EU).  In addition to the United States, Canada designated these same individuals today as part of a coordinated action in a strong demonstration of the international community’s continued condemnation of Russia’s interference in Crimean politics.  Additionally, OFAC designated one individual and one entity providing rail services in support of Russia’s efforts to deepen the economic integration of Russia and Crimea.  Today’s action demonstrates Treasury’s unwavering commitment to continue holding Russia accountable for its destabilizing activity in Ukraine.

“Treasury’s action, taken in close coordination with our international allies and partners, reiterates our unwavering support for restoring free and fair democratic political processes in Crimea,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The coordinated U.S., EU, and Canadian designations limit the ability of these illegitimate officials to do business internationally and highlights the strength of the transatlantic alliance in standing up to Russia’s continued aggression.”

DESIGNATION FOR OPERATING IN THE CRIMEA REGION OF UKRAINE (E.O. 13685)

To date, 45 state housing authorities have been awarded a total of $3.1 billion in payments in lieu of tax credits for affordable housing projects.

This innovative Recovery Act program allows the federal government to partner with states to support local developers and helps ensure that housing developers can access the financing necessary to build affordable housing, said Treasury Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin. We have worked quickly to make available more than $3 billion to state housing agencies, and we expect to see continued efforts at the state level, so that these funds can be delivered to the communities that need it most.

X058F37AC410E39,Treasury,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) awarded 195 Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) $202 million in grants and loans today through the latest rounds of the Community Development Financial Institutions Program (CDFI Program) and the Native American CDFI Assistance Program (NACA Program). This announcement caps the 20th anniversary celebration of the creation of the CDFI Fund and the CDFI Program.



“Today’s awards highlight how much the CDFI Program has contributed in its 20 year history towards building a strong network of CDFIs across the country,” said CDFI Fund Director Annie Donovan. “These important community partners are not only on the frontlines of economically distressed communities providing needed capital and credit, they are building a more inclusive economy which benefits the nation as a whole.”

In 1996, 31 CDFIs received the very first CDFI Program awards with $35.5 million from the CDFI Fund. Today, the CDFI Fund announced $182.3 million in Financial Assistance and Technical Assistance awards to 152 organizations, including 28 first-time awardees, through the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 round of the CDFI Program. In addition, $22 million was awarded to 11 organizations through the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. A total of 374 applications were received requesting more than $439 million under this round of the program.  



The CDFI Program invests in and builds the capacity of community credit unions, banks, loan funds, and other financial institutions serving rural and urban communities across the nation that lack adequate access to affordable financial products and services. Through the first 20 rounds of this program, the CDFI Fund has awarded more than $1.5 billion, helping build a nationwide network of more than 950 CDFIs located in every state, all focused on economically empowering the communities they serve.

In addition, the NACA Program awarded $19.6 million in Financial Assistance and Technical Assistance to 43 organizations, including seven new NACA Program awardees. The program is designed to encourage the creation and strengthening of Native CDFIs.  Organizations funded through the NACA Program serve a wide range of Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities (Native Communities), and reflect a diversity of institutions in various stages of development – from organizations in the early planning stages of creating a CDFI, to tribal entities working to certify an existing lending program, to established CDFIs in need of further capacity building assistance.  A total of 60 applications were received requesting more than $37.5 million for the FY 2015 round, which was the CDFI Fund’s 14th round of funding with awards specifically for Native Communities.

X63AC732DE2FD17,Treasury,"The Treasury Department announced today that social security numbers will no longer be visible through the envelope window of checks mailed to more than 14 million Social Security and Supplemental Security Income recipients beginning with September payments.

It is a priority at Treasury to protect personal information, said Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler. By removing social security numbers from the window of the mailings of Social Security checks, we will help safeguard the privacy of millions of Americans.

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) issues nearly 900 million payments annually. Although most payments are now made electronically, 270 million of these payments are still made by check.

In 1998, social security numbers were removed from view in the envelope window used to mail Internal Revenue Service tax refund checks. Following Y2K preparations, FMS undertook steps to conceal the numbers from remaining checks. The final phase of the project, affecting fewer than 10 percent of Treasury check payments, will be completed next spring.

Beginning in September, FMS will use the check number rather than the social security number to identify and retrieve payments that are ineligible for delivery. During 1999, over 1 million ineligible Social Security payments with a value of approximately $620 million were removed from mailings. Pulling these checks prior to mailing eliminates inconvenience for the recipient or family of the recipient, and avoids a time consuming and costly claims process for recipients, banks, and the government.

Treasury has conducted a nationwide effort to convert all government payments to electronic transfer through its Electronic Funds Transfer campaign, EFT 99. As a result, approximately 70 percent of all government payments are made electronically today.

On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it had issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive an EUA. Operation Warp Speed has allocated more than 5.9 million doses of the vaccine for jurisdictions to receive in the coming week. Below are statements from HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.

“On January 7, before China had reported even one death from the novel coronavirus or confirmed human-to-human transmission, NIH scientists and innovators at Moderna agreed to begin work on the vaccine that received FDA authorization today. In March, BARDA scientists joined the partnership and worked with Moderna and NIH to reach commercialization, building on support BARDA has provided since 2016 for the remarkable mRNA technology. To have two vaccines against a novel virus authorized and distributed within a year is extraordinary, and to have one of these vaccines developed by scientists at the NIH should be a great source of pride for every member of the HHS family and every American. The public-private partnership of Operation Warp Speed has helped Moderna, an American startup, become one of the first two companies to receive FDA authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine. Authorization of Moderna’s vaccine means we can accelerate the vaccination of frontline healthcare workers and Americans in long-term-care facilities, and, ultimately, bring a faster end to this pandemic.” – HHS Secretary Alex Azar

“The swift authorization of a second vaccine by the FDA is great news for the American people.

X070A87A6147A97,HHS,"G7 Health Ministers condemn attacks on health facilities in Ukraine
Today, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra joined fellow G7 health ministers in issuing the statement below condemning the attacks on Ukraine health facilities:

We, the G7 Health Ministers, strongly condemn President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, which has already caused thousands of deaths and suffering for millions of people and which grossly violates international law, including the UN Charter, and undermines international peace and security. We demand that Russia immediately cease its unprovoked and unjustified military actions, withdraw all its forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, and abide by UN General Assembly resolution titled “Aggression against Ukraine” supported by 141 states at the 11th emergency special session as well as the legally binding decision by the International Court of Justice ordering Russia to immediately suspend its war of aggression against Ukraine.

We also condemn in the strongest possible terms indiscriminate attacks on the Ukrainian population, and health facilities and health workers who are caught in the crossfire in Ukraine. We fully support the joint statement issued by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on 13 March to stop the devastating impact of attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine, such as the horrific shelling of the maternity hospital in Mariupol. Intentionally directing attacks at civilians and civilian infrastructure, including health care facilities and workers, violates International Humanitarian Law. Health must remain a priority, with health workers being protected so they can provide emergency care to save lives, and with health systems and facilities being protected so that they remain accessible to all who need them.

Aid organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver medical aid to people in need, with the problem becoming more acute as the war spreads, having a direct negative impact on public health. Humanitarian partners and health care workers must be able to safely maintain essential health service delivery for civilians across Ukraine as well as for refugees crossing into neighbouring countries. International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld, and the protection of civilians must remain a top priority.

Since the start of Russia’s further invasion, 64 attacks hitting health care facilities have been documented in the WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care, resulting in 15 deaths and 37 injuries. In most of the cases, health care facilities were damaged or destroyed. Beyond the immediate deaths and injuries, these attacks have a huge impact on people’s lives and reduce access to essential health services – especially for sick and wounded people as well as for children, pregnant women, older persons and other vulnerable populations – and can lead to delayed treatments, worsening the prognosis of affected people and resulting in indirect deaths. Attacks on health care facilities will have a long-term impact on people’s ability to recover from illnesses many years after the conflict is over. These attacks must stop immediately. Health workers on the frontline must have unhindered access to support populations in need.

The healthcare system in Ukraine is under significant strain. We are extremely concerned about the disruptions in medical supplies and essential and routine health services as well as widespread destruction of water infrastructure and sanitation. The lack of access to such essential services is having an extremely serious negative impact on the health of people in Ukraine and the region. Every effort to prevent collapse of the healthcare system must be made.

We commend the work of organizations and staff coordinating and delivering essential health support and services to people affected in Ukraine and the neighboring countries, including WHO, ICRC, UN agencies and international organizations. We also remain vigilant of the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in Ukraine and amongst displaced persons and refugee populations who have taken shelter in the neighboring countries, and we are ready to provide specific support through safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines dose-sharing.

WHO has issued an emergency appeal for 57.5 million US Dollars for Ukraine. WHO is delivering care and support to people affected by this crisis via the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies through the government and partners. So far, WHO has rapidly delivered more than 100 metric tons of medical commodities to Ukraine and released more than 10 million US Dollars from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to respond to the region’s urgent health needs. The WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies has proven to be one of the highly effective tools in emergencies. However, it is nearly depleted.

We thank WHO and other international organizations and entities across the region for their tireless work as well as coordination with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, providing health supplies, including medicines and diagnostics, trauma and emergency surgery kits, to Ukraine to keep medical supply chains open and deliver life-saving care as well and psycho-social support to those in need, as well as their support to neighboring countries.",8,11.108826906928158
X1D111BC2881822,HHS,"Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), announced the availability of $13 million in funding to increase access to behavioral health care services and address health inequities in rural America, including through evidence-based, trauma-informed treatment for substance use disorder.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused behavioral health challenges for Americans of all ages and backgrounds,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “This investment is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to address the inequities that still exist surrounding behavioral health and advance care in rural America. It will support comprehensive behavioral health prevention, treatment, harm reduction and recovery interventions in rural communities – furthering the goals of our new overdose prevention strategy.”

HRSA’s Federal Office of Rural Health Policy will make awards through the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) - Behavioral Health Care Support. Eligible applicants include entities such as Rural Health Clinics, federally recognized tribes, tribal organizations, and community- and faith-based organizations.

“Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic must include meeting the behavioral health needs of individuals experiencing substance use disorder,” said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. “In rural areas, accessing the care and services to address these needs can be a particular challenge. The funding we are announcing today is directly targeted to the community needs of rural areas and will help expand access to behavioral health services to meet these needs.”

Since 2018, the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program – a multi-year initiative administered by HRSA – has provided over $400 million in direct grants and technical assistance to rural communities addressing behavioral health care challenges, including substance use disorder. To date, the initiative has expanded access to substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services in over 1,500 counties nationwide, with RCORP grant recipients serving over 2 million individuals in rural communities in FY 2020.",8,11.270485216787668
X1BB2C3056B847F,HHS,"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is now accepting applications for the first-ever SAMHSA Harm Reduction grant program and expects to issue $30 million in grant awards. This funding, authorized by the American Rescue Plan, will help increase access to a range of community harm reduction services and support harm reduction service providers as they work to help prevent overdose deaths and reduce health risks often associated with drug use. SAMHSA will accept applications from State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, Tribal organizations, non-profit community-based organizations, and primary and behavioral health organizations.  

With overdose deaths exceeding 100,000 over a 12-month period for the first time, this funding opportunity will provide support to those working in their communities to reduce the harms of drug use. Providing funding and support for innovative harm reduction services is in line with the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to address the overdose epidemic, and is a key pillar for the first time in the multi-faceted Health and Human Services’ overdose prevention strategy announced in October. This funding allows organizations to expand their community-based overdose prevention programs in a variety of ways, including distributing overdose-reversal medications and fentanyl test strips, providing overdose education and counseling, and managing or expanding syringe services programs, which help control the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.

“The reality is, evidence-based harm reduction services are out of reach for far too many people,” said National Drug Control Policy Director Dr. Rahul Gupta, who also announced a new model law to help states ensure access to safe, effective, and cost-saving syringe services programs. “Building on the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to expand evidence-based prevention, treatment and recovery support services, this historic funding will help make harm reduction services more accessible, so we can meet people where they are and save lives.”

“Too many Americans, more than 100,000 people over the last year, have lost their lives to drug overdose. Our new HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy is clear – harm reduction services are critical to keeping people who use drugs alive and as healthy as possible,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Americans deserve health services that address the full range of drug use and addiction issues, and this funding will help provide those services in the neighborhoods in which they live.”

“Innovative harm reduction services will help keep Americans alive,” said Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Thanks to this American Rescue Plan funding, harm reduction service providers in historically under-resourced communities will receive long-awaited support to help stem the disproportionate number of overdose deaths and related health issues facing those communities.”

SAMHSA will distribute $10 million per year over the next three years. Grant recipients must use the funds to support harm reduction services. Harm reduction service providers will be asked to develop or expand evidence-based services that may include, but not be limited to: the provision of sterile syringes, safe sex kits, prevention education about synthetic opioids and other substances, overdose prevention kits including naloxone distribution, peer worker engagement, medical services, case management and referral to treatment. Warm handoffs that facilitate engagement in care and referrals to treatment for individuals seeking these support services are also critical components of this grant program. Harm reduction services will be trauma-informed and guided by harm reduction stakeholder groups and other community members.

XD49D2F6CDBCA8C,HHS,"Protecting Americans’ health and well-being has always been at the heart of fighting climate change, and now for the first time, its importance is being elevated at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS is establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) in response to President Joe Biden’s Executive Order Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. This is the first office of its kind at the national level to address climate change and health equity. The Office’s mission is to protect vulnerable communities who disproportionately bear the brunt of pollution and climate-driven disasters, such as drought and wildfires, at the expense of public health.

“History will judge us for the actions we take today to protect our world and our health from climate change. The consequences for our inaction are real and worsening. We’ve always known that health is at the center of climate change, and now we’re going to double-down on a necessity: fighting climate change in order to help protect public health in our communities.” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.

With the threats of extreme heat and drought, growing wildfires, and a high risk of hurricanes so evident this summer, HHS is mobilizing its resources to protect the health of all Americans. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 250,000 deaths exit disclaimer icon will occur every year due to climate change. The threats to health are serious and numerous. But we have the ability to protect people, especially in our most vulnerable pockets of America.  

“COVID-19 highlighted the inequities faced throughout our nation. Unfortunately, some of the same groups disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 will be the same groups struggling the most with the effects of climate change on our health. We will use the lessons learned from COVID-19 to address these disparities, prioritizing and protecting the nation’s health,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel L. Levine.  

“Climate change is turbo-charging the horrific wildfires, extreme heat, and devastating floods that are killing people and making millions more sick from exposure to unhealthy smoke, mold and debilitating heat. The new HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity is fulfilling President Biden’s vision to bring America’s world-class medical community into the fight against climate change—a fight for our health that ensures no community is left behind,” said National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy.",4,14.576095578827758
X97CBD9E4B57513,HHS,"Today, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the resolution of eleven investigations in its Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Right of Access Initiative, bringing the total number of these enforcement actions to thirty-eight since the initiative began.  OCR created this initiative to support individuals' right to timely access their health records at a reasonable cost under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

HIPAA gives people the right to see and get copies of their health information from their healthcare providers and health plans.  After receiving a request, an entity that is regulated by HIPAA has, absent an extension, 30 days to provide an individual or their representative with their records in a timely manner.

“It should not take a federal investigation before a HIPAA covered entity provides patients, or their personal representatives, with access to their medical records,” said OCR Director Lisa J. Pino.  “Health care organizations should take note that there are now 38 enforcement actions in our Right of Access Initiative and understand that OCR is serious about upholding the law and peoples’ fundamental right to timely access to their medical records.”

OCR has taken the following enforcement actions and ensured that complainants received copies of their records:

ACPM Podiatry, with offices in Peoria and Canton, Illinois, failed to provide a former patient with his requested medical records.  In response to an initial complaint, OCR provided ACPM with written technical assistance regarding the Privacy Rule’s right of access standard and closed the matter. OCR received a second complaint from the same individual, alleging that ACPM still had not provided the medical records, after numerous requests. ACPM did not respond to multiple data requests from OCR, nor to OCR’s Letter of Opportunity and Notice of Proposed Determination.  OCR issued a Notice of Final Determination and imposed a civil money penalty of $100,000.
Associated Retina Specialists, of New York, failed to provide a patient with a copy of her medical records until three days after OCR initiated its investigation, and nearly five months after the complainant’s first written request. Associated Retina has agreed to take corrective actions and paid $22,500 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule right of access standard.
Lawrence Bell, Jr., D.D.S., a dental practice located in Baltimore, MD, failed to provide timely access to a patient’s medical record.  The dental practice has agreed to take corrective actions and has paid $5,000 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's right of access standard.
Coastal Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT), located in Ormond Beach, Florida, failed to provide timely access to medical records after multiple requests for such records from a patient. Coastal ENT has agreed to take corrective actions and has paid $20,000 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's right of access standard
Danbury Psychiatric Consultants (DPC), located in Massachusetts, failed to respond timely to a complainant’s access request.  DPC also withheld the complainant’s access on the basis that the complainant had an outstanding balance and required a signed request or authorization request. DPC has agreed to take corrective actions and has paid $3500 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's right of access standard.
Erie County Medical Center Corporation, a public benefit corporation that operates a hospital, Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), located in Buffalo, New York, failed to timely provide an individual with a complete copy of his medical records.

MWH has agreed to take corrective actions and has paid $55,000 to settle a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s right of access standard.
Memorial Hermann Health System, a not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas, consisting of 17 hospitals, including Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital, failed to respond timely to a complainant’s access request.  Memorial Hermann has agreed to corrective actions and has paid $240,000 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's right of access standard.
Southwest Surgical Associates (SWSA) is a group practice with nine locations in the Greater Houston, TX area, failed to provide an individual timely access to their health information.

X583548D028D599,HHS,"Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through its Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is issuing guidance on how covered health care providers and health plans can use remote communication technologies to provide audio-only telehealth services when such communications are conducted in a manner that is consistent with the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, including when OCR’s Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth - PDF is no longer in effect.

This guidance will help individuals to continue to benefit from audio-only telehealth by clarifying how covered entities can provide these services in compliance with the HIPAA Rules and by improving public confidence that covered entities are protecting the privacy and security of their health information.

While telehealth can significantly expand access to health care, certain populations may have difficulty accessing or be unable to access technologies used for audio-video telehealth because of various factors, including financial resources, limited English proficiency, disability, internet access, availability of sufficient broadband, and cell coverage in the geographic area.  Audio-only telehealth, especially using technologies that do not require broadband availability, can help address the needs of some of these individuals.

“Audio telehealth is an important tool to reach patients in rural communities, individuals with disabilities, and others seeking the convenience of remote options. This guidance explains how the HIPAA Rules permit health care providers and plans to offer audio telehealth while protecting the privacy and security of individuals’ health information,” said OCR Director Lisa J.

“Once again, the Supreme Court has made clear that the landmark Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. Today’s ruling is a victory for all Americans, especially people with a pre-existing condition or anyone who was worried they could be forced to choose between their health and making ends meet. Health care should be a right -- not a privilege just for the healthy and wealthy.

“Today’s decision means that all Americans continue to have a right to access affordable care, free of discrimination. More than 133 million people with pre-existing conditions, like cancer, asthma or diabetes, can have peace of mind knowing that the health protections they rely on are safe. Women who need access to birth control, life-saving maternity care and preventive care can rest easy, knowing that their care is protected and covered. Seniors and people with disabilities can breathe easy knowing their health protections will continue. Individuals who have faced discrimination can continue accessing care without fear. And people relying on Medicaid and Medicare should know these programs are stronger than ever.

“As a Member of Congress, I helped draft and pass the ACA. As the Attorney General of California, I took this case all the way to the Supreme Court. And now, as Secretary, I will continue to stand up and stand with you to protect access to affordable health care. The COVID-19 public health emergency has underscored the importance of safeguarding this life-saving law and it is only fitting that the Supreme Court recognized its lawfulness. Now we can build on the Affordable Care Act by implementing the investments that President Biden has made in America’s health with the American Rescue Plan and through the expanded Special Enrollment Period.

Today, United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued the following statement on the Supreme Court’s ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson, overturning Roe v. Wade: 

“Today's decision is a major step backward for public health. Reproductive health decisions – like all health decisions – should be made by patients and their health care providers.  

“Restricting these decisions compromises the essential principle of maintaining an individual’s autonomy and control over their health decisions and creates dangerous health risks. When reproductive health decisions are restricted, the number of unplanned pregnancies and unsafe abortions rises. Ultimately, the health of women and pregnant people is put at risk – an effect that will be felt disproportionately in historically marginalized populations, including communities of color, low-income Americans, and rural residents. Health care providers, who are already under extraordinary strains due to the pandemic, will be forced into an impossible choice between doing what's right for their patients and complying with laws that are at odds with their patient's health interests.    

“While some states have already taken action to preserve reproductive health rights, in many others, today’s decision means that the reproductive health protections many Americans have relied on have now already disappeared or will soon be gone.

“As Surgeon General and as a doctor, I know that equitable access to reproductive health services is a cornerstone for health, and I will do everything I can to speak up for and support women’s right to make their own decisions about their health.” ",8,10.343747213264983

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced three awards totaling more than $40 million to four whistleblowers who provided information and assistance in three separate covered actions.

In the first order, the SEC issued an award of approximately $37 million to two joint whistleblowers who provided key evidence that contributed to the success of the covered action.   The whistleblowers also provided ongoing assistance and helped the staff identify additional information that advanced the investigation. 

In the second order, the SEC issued approximately $1.8 million to a whistleblower who provided important, new information that prompted Commission staff to open an investigation into the misconduct. The whistleblower continued to assist the staff by providing interviews and additional documents.

In the third order, the SEC awarded approximately $1.5 million to a whistleblower who provided new information that shaped staff’s investigative strategy and significantly contributed to the success of the covered action.  The whistleblower also provided substantial and ongoing assistance by helping the Commission staff identify issues.

""Credible tips of securities laws violations are a valuable component of the Commission’s enforcement program,"" said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower. ""The critical information provided by these whistleblowers aided the Commission’s investigations and helped the Commission bring these successful enforcement actions.""

The SEC has awarded approximately $1.2 billion to 245 individuals since issuing its first award in 2012. All payments are made out of an investor protection fund established by Congress that is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators.  No money has been taken or withheld from harmed investors to pay whistleblower awards.  Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.  Whistleblower awards can range from 10 percent to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.

As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower’s identity.",4,8.776540758502792

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the company’s September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers.   This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach.  In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading. 

In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta today, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.

According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach.  The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options.  Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.

Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.

“As we allege, Bonthu, who was entrusted with confidential information by his employer, misused that information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach and then sought to illegally profit,” said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office.  “Corporate insiders simply cannot abuse their access to sensitive information and illegally enrich themselves.”

In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.

To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.  The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries.  The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.",4,10.072589054279808

A Colorado stock promoter and two of his companies agreed to pay $4.2 million to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's charges for fraudulently promoting and trading a cannabis stock. On Dec. 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado entered the final judgment.

The SEC's complaint alleged that Jeffrey O. Friedland touted – or promoted – the stock of cannabis company OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp., while misrepresenting his own investment in OWC and his professional relationship with the company. According to the complaint, Friedland promoted OWC to investors without disclosing his role as a paid promoter or the amount of his compensation. As alleged in the complaint, Friedland held millions of shares of OWC stock through two companies that he controlled, Intiva Pharma LLC and Global Corporate Strategies LLC, with the bulk of the shares received as compensation for promoting OWC to investors, including retail investors.  Additionally, according to the complaint, Friedland secretly sold his OWC shares into the market at the same time that he was touting OWC stock to the public as a long-term investment.

""Retail investors are entitled to the facts about promoters' relationships with the companies they tout under our securities laws,"" said Associate Director Melissa Hodgman. ""The $2 million penalty assessed against Friedland reflects the SEC's strong commitment to protecting investors' right to fair and accurate disclosure.""

Following a series of Commission actions, court proceedings and Congressional action, the Securities and Exchange Commission today voted to propose rules that would require resource extraction issuers to disclose payments made to foreign governments or the U.S. federal government for the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. 

The Commission first adopted rules in this area in 2012, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  The 2012 rules were vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Commission then adopted new rules in 2016, which were disapproved by a joint resolution of Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. 

Although the joint resolution of Congress vacated the 2016 rules, the statutory mandate remains in effect.  As a result, the Commission is statutorily obligated to issue a rule.  Under the Congressional Review Act, however, the Commission may not reissue the same rule in “substantially the same form” or issue a new rule that is “substantially the same” as the disapproved rule.

“I commend the staff for expertly navigating legal and regulatory questions when crafting this proposal,” said Chairman Jay Clayton.  “The proposal is designed to address the statutory mandate in a manner that does not result in undue compliance burdens or competitive harm.” 

The proposal will have a 60-day public comment period following its publication in the Federal Register.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has voted to adopt a new rule and form amendments that are designed to modernize the regulation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), by establishing a clear and consistent framework for the vast majority of ETFs operating today.  The adoption will facilitate greater competition and innovation in the ETF marketplace, leading to more choice for investors.  It also will allow ETFs to come to market more quickly without the time or expense of applying for individual exemptive relief.  In addition, the Commission voted to issue an exemptive order that further harmonizes related relief for broker-dealers.

“Since ETFs were first developed over 27 years ago, they have provided investors with a number of benefits, including access to a wide array of investment strategies, in many cases at a low cost,” said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. “As the ETF industry continues to grow in size and importance, particularly to Main Street investors, it is important to have a consistent, transparent, and efficient regulatory framework that eliminates regulatory hurdles while maintaining appropriate investor protections.”

ETFs are hybrid investment products not originally allowed under the U.S. securities laws.  Their shares trade on an exchange like a stock or closed-end fund, but they also allow identified large institutions to transact directly with the fund.  Since 1992, the Commission has issued more than 300 exemptive orders allowing ETFs to operate under the Investment Company Act.  ETFs have grown substantially in that period, and today there are approximately 2,000 ETFs with over $3.3 trillion in total net assets.  Investors use ETFs for a variety of purposes, including core components of long-term investment portfolios, investment of temporary cash holdings, and for hedging portfolios.

ETFs relying on the rule and related exemptive order will have to comply with certain conditions designed to protect investors, including conditions regarding transparency and disclosure.  To help create a consistent ETF regulatory framework, one year after the effective date of the rule, the Commission is rescinding exemptive relief previously granted to certain ETFs, including those that will be permitted to operate in reliance on the rule.  The rule and form amendments will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, but there will be a one-year transition period for compliance with the form amendments.",4,12.00404248849051

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against three individuals and three entities in connection with an alleged fraudulent, ongoing international trading program that has placed at risk more than $125 million of investor funds.

According to the SEC's complaint, beginning in March 2016, Mediatrix Capital Inc. and its three principals, Michael S. Young, Michael S. Stewart, and Bryant E. Sewall, induced investors to invest by falsely representing that their money would be invested using a highly profitable algorithmic trading strategy that had never experienced an unprofitable month and had returned more than 1,600% since inception. In truth, the complaint alleges, the defendants' trading strategy consistently lost money—losing more than $18 million from its trading in 2018 alone. In addition to repeatedly misrepresenting the profitability of the trading, the complaint alleges defendants also misled investors by falsifying account statements and making Ponzi-like payments, all while misappropriating more than $35 million of investor money for defendants’ personal use, including to purchase luxury properties and vehicles.

""We allege that this scheme has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in investor losses, in part, to fund defendants' luxurious lifestyle,"" said Kurt L.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Seoul-based KT Corporation (KT Corp.) will pay $6.3 million to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing improper payments for the benefit of government officials in Korea and Vietnam.

According to the SEC’s order, KT Corp., South Korea’s largest telecommunications operator, engaged in multiple schemes to make improper payments in Korea and Vietnam.  KT Corp. lacked sufficient internal accounting controls over charitable donations, third-party payments, executive bonuses, and gift card purchases.  As a result, KT Corp. employees, including high-level executives, were able to generate slush funds that were used for gifts and illegal political contributions to government officials in Korea who had influence over KT Corp.’s business.  Other employees were able to make payments in connection with seeking business from government customers in Vietnam.

""For nearly a decade, KT Corp. failed to implement sufficient internal accounting controls with respect to key aspects of its business operations, while at the same time lacking relevant anti-corruption policies or procedures.  Issuers must be sure to devote appropriate attention to meeting their obligations under the FCPA,"" said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit.

In November 2021, South Korean authorities indicted KT Corp. and 14 executives for criminal violations related to illegal political contributions from the slush funds.

KT Corp. consented to the SEC’s order without admitting or denying the findings that it violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and agreed to pay approximately $3.5 million in civil penalties and $2.8 million in disgorgement.",4,13.522147411867419

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against technology company NVIDIA Corporation for inadequate disclosures concerning the impact of cryptomining on the company’s gaming business.

The SEC’s order finds that, during consecutive quarters in NVIDIA’s fiscal year 2018, the company failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its graphics processing units (GPUs) designed and marketed for gaming. Cryptomining is the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying crypto transactions on distributed ledgers. As demand for and interest in crypto rose in 2017, NVIDIA customers increasingly used its gaming GPUs for cryptomining.

In two of its Forms 10-Q for its fiscal year 2018, NVIDIA reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business. NVIDIA had information, however, that this increase in gaming sales was driven in significant part by cryptomining. Despite this, NVIDIA did not disclose in its Forms 10-Q, as it was required to do, these significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance. The SEC’s order also finds that NVIDIA’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that NVIDIA did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypto, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by cryptomining.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” said Kristina Littman, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”

The SEC’s order finds that NVIDIA violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the disclosure provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order also finds that NVIDIA failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty.",4,11.369255978419716
X1450EE7511BDCE,SEC,"Washington, D.C., Dec. 11, 2008 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Bernard L. Madoff and his investment firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, with securities fraud for a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that he perpetrated on advisory clients of his firm. The SEC is seeking emergency relief for investors, including an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver for the firm.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Madoff yesterday informed two senior employees that his investment advisory business was a fraud. Madoff told these employees that he was ""finished,"" that he had ""absolutely nothing,"" that ""it's all just one big lie,"" and that it was ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme."" The senior employees understood him to be saying that he had for years been paying returns to certain investors out of the principal received from other, different investors. Madoff admitted in this conversation that the firm was insolvent and had been for years, and that he estimated the losses from this fraud were at least $50 billion.
""We are alleging a massive fraud — both in terms of scope and duration,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We are moving quickly and decisively to stop the fraud and protect remaining assets for investors, and we are working closely with the criminal authorities to hold Mr. Madoff accountable.""

Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of Enforcement in the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions.""

According to regulatory filings, the Madoff firm had more than $17 billion in assets under management as of the beginning of 2008. It appears that virtually all assets of the advisory business are missing.

Madoff founded the firm in 1960 and has been a prominent member of the securities industry throughout his career. Madoff served as vice chairman of the NASD, a member of its board of governors, and chairman of its New York region. He was also a member of NASDAQ Stock Market's board of governors and its executive committee and served as chairman of its trading committee.

The complaint charges the defendants with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition to emergency and interim relief, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.",4,10.64067766122994

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged businessman and computer programmer John McAfee for promoting investments in initial coin offerings (ICOs) to his Twitter followers without disclosing that he was paid to do so. McAfee’s bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, Jr., was also charged for his role in the alleged scheme.

According to the SEC’s complaint, McAfee promoted multiple ICOs on Twitter, allegedly pretending to be impartial and independent even though he was paid more than $23 million in digital assets for the promotions. When certain investors asked whether he was paid to promote the ICOs, McAfee allegedly denied receiving any compensation from the issuers. The complaint alleges that McAfee made other false and misleading statements, such as claiming that he had personally invested in some of the ICOs and that he was advising certain issuers. The complaint alleges that Watson assisted McAfee by negotiating the promotion deals with the ICO issuers, helping McAfee cash out the digital asset payments for the promotions, and, for one of the ICOs McAfee was promoting, having his then-spouse tweet interest in the ICO. Watson was allegedly paid at least $316,000 for his role. According to the complaint, while McAfee and Watson profited, investors were left holding digital assets that are now essentially worthless.

McAfee and Watson also allegedly engaged in a separate scheme to profit from a digital asset security by secretly accumulating a large position in McAfee’s accounts, touting that security on Twitter while intending to sell it, and then selling McAfee’s holdings as the price rose.

“Potential investors in digital asset securities are entitled to know if promoters were compensated by the issuers of those securities,” said Kristina Littman, Cyber Unit Chief.  “McAfee, assisted by Watson, allegedly leveraged his fame to deceptively tout numerous digital asset securities to his followers without informing investors of his role as a paid promoter.”

The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges McAfee and Watson with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, McAfee with violating the anti-touting provisions, and Watson with aiding and abetting McAfee’s violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks to bar McAfee from serving as a public company officer and director.

Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it is providing conditional regulatory relief for certain publicly traded company filing obligations under the federal securities laws. The impacts of the coronavirus may present challenges for certain companies that are required to provide information to trading markets, shareholders, and the SEC. These companies may include U.S. companies located in the affected areas, as well as companies with operations in those regions.

To address potential compliance issues, the Commission has issued an order that, subject to certain conditions, provides publicly traded companies with an additional 45 days to file certain disclosure reports that would otherwise have been due between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Among other conditions, companies must convey through a current report a summary of why the relief is needed in their particular circumstances. The Commission may extend the time period for the relief, with any additional conditions it deems appropriate, or provide additional relief as circumstances warrant. Companies and their representatives are encouraged to contact SEC staff with questions or matters of particular concern.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton noted, ""The health and safety of all participants in our markets is of paramount importance. While timely public filing of Exchange Act reports is a cornerstone of well-functioning markets, we recognize that this situation may prevent certain issuers from compiling these reports within required timeframes.""

Chairman Clayton added, ""We also remind all companies to provide investors with insight regarding their assessment of, and plans for addressing, material risks to their business and operations resulting from the coronavirus to the fullest extent practicable to keep investors and markets informed of material developments.  How companies plan and respond to the events as they unfold can be material to an investment decision, and I urge companies to work with their audit committees and auditors to ensure that their financial reporting, auditing and review processes are as robust as practicable in light of the circumstances in meeting the applicable requirements. Companies providing forward-looking information in an effort to keep investors informed about material developments, including known trends or uncertainties regarding coronavirus, can take steps to avail themselves of the safe harbor in Section 21E of the Exchange Act for forward-looking statements.""",4,11.463040965810386

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settlements with David Kwon and Igor Sabodakha, two traders who allegedly profited from trading on nonpublic corporate earnings information hacked from the SEC’s EDGAR system. The settlement agreements are subject to court approval.

According to the SEC’s complaint, Kwon, of California, Sabodakha, of Ukraine, and seven other defendants participated in a scheme to hack into EDGAR and extract material, nonpublic information to use for illegal trading. The complaint alleged that a Ukrainian hacker extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results. Kwon and Sabodakha allegedly traded on the basis of this hacked information in the narrow window of time between when the files were extracted from EDGAR and when the information was released to the public. Sabodakha also allegedly previously traded based on material nonpublic information obtained through the hack of at least two newswire services.

“As alleged in our complaint, the defendants engaged in an international scheme to obtain and use hacked information to enrich themselves,” said Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC’s Market Abuse Unit. “Today’s result reflects the SEC’s ability to investigate complex schemes conducted both here and abroad and to hold their perpetrators accountable.”

Kwon and Sabodakha consented to the entry of final judgments that would permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws. Kwon agreed to pay $165,474 in disgorgement, representing the profits from his illegal trades, and $16,254 in prejudgment interest. The settlement reserves the issue of a civil penalty for Kwon for further determination by the court upon a motion of the SEC. Sabodakha agreed to disgorge $148,804 in profits from his illegal trades, including trades he conducted in the account of his wife, Victoria Vorochek, with prejudgment interest of $20,945. Sabodakha also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $148,804.  The SEC will move to dismiss the charges it had filed against Vorochek.",4,10.910214877311715

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robinhood Financial LLC for repeated misstatements that failed to disclose the firm’s receipt of payments from trading firms for routing customer orders to them, and with failing to satisfy its duty to seek the best reasonably available terms to execute customer orders.  Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges.

According to the SEC’s order, between 2015 and late 2018, Robinhood made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications, including in FAQ pages on its website, about its largest revenue source when describing how it made money – namely, payments from trading firms in exchange for Robinhood sending its customer orders to those firms for execution, also known as “payment for order flow.”  As the SEC’s order finds, one of Robinhood’s selling points to customers was that trading was “commission free,” but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices.  Despite this, according to the SEC’s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors.  The order finds that Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.  Robinhood made these false and misleading statements during the time in which it was growing rapidly.

“Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.”

“Robinhood failed to seek to obtain the best reasonably available terms when executing customers’ orders, causing customers to lose tens of millions of dollars,” said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit.  “Today’s action sends a clear message that the Commission will not allow brokers to ignore their obligations to customers.”

“There are many new companies seeking to harness the power of technology to provide alternative ways for people to invest their money,” added Erin E. Schneider, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.  “But innovation does not negate responsibility under the federal securities laws.”

Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Robinhood agreed to a cease-and-desist order prohibiting it from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, censuring it, and requiring it to pay a $65 million civil penalty.  Robinhood also agreed to retain an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures relating to customer communications, payment for order flow, and best execution of customer orders, and to ensure that Robinhood is effectively following those policies and procedures.",4,11.280821234631977

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against five Russian nationals for engaging in a multi-year scheme to profit from stolen corporate earnings announcements obtained by hacking into the systems of two U.S.-based filing agent companies before the announcements were made public. The filing agents assist publicly traded companies with the preparation and filing of periodic reports with the SEC, including quarterly reports containing earnings information.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleges that defendant Ivan Yermakov used deceptive hacking techniques to access the filing agents’ systems and directly or indirectly provided not-yet-public corporate earnings announcements stolen from those systems to his co-defendants Vladislav Kliushin, Nikolai Rumiantcev, Mikhail Irzak, and Igor Sladkov. According to the complaint, from 2018 through 2020, the traders used 20 different brokerage accounts located in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Cyprus and Portugal to generate profits of at least $82 million using the stolen information to make trades before over 500 corporate earnings announcements. The defendants allegedly shared a portion of their enormous profits by funneling them through a Russian information technology company founded by Kliushin and for which Yermakov and Rumiantcev serve as directors.

“With this action, the SEC, using its powerful analytical tools, has exposed a highly sophisticated and deceptive scheme to steal and monetize non-public corporate information,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “While we remain steadfast in our commitment to protect the integrity of our securities markets against bad actors no matter where they are located or what sophisticated tactics they use, we strongly encourage companies to shore up their safeguards against, and remain vigilant for cyber breaches that compromise their non-public information.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the five defendants named in the SEC’s action and that defendant Vladislav Kliushin was extradited from Switzerland.

The SEC’s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed amendments to its rules regarding disclosure about an issuer’s repurchases of its equity securities, often referred to as buybacks.

""Share buybacks have become a significant component of how public issuers return capital to shareholders,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""I think we can lessen the information asymmetries between issuers and investors through enhanced timeliness and granularity of disclosures that today’s proposal would provide.""

The proposed rules would require an issuer to provide a new Form SR before the end of the first business day following the day the issuer executes a share repurchase. Form SR would require disclosure identifying the class of securities purchased, the total amount purchased, the average price paid, as well as the aggregate total amount purchased on the open market in reliance on the safe harbor in Exchange Act Rule 10b-18 or pursuant to a plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).

The proposed amendments also would enhance existing periodic disclosure requirements regarding repurchases of an issuer’s equity securities. Specifically, the proposed amendments would require an issuer to disclose: the objective or rationale for the share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the repurchase amounts; any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the issuer’s securities by its officers and directors during a repurchase program, including any restriction on such transactions; and whether the issuer is making its repurchases  pursuant to a plan that it intends to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) and/or  the conditions of the Exchange Act Rule 10b-18 non-exclusive safe harbor.

The proposed rules apply to issuers that repurchase securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including foreign private issuers and certain registered closed-end funds.

The proposing release will be published on SEC.gov and in the Federal Register. The comment period will remain open for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.",4,13.431646293888951

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Crosby Independent School District (Crosby ISD) and its former Chief Financial Officer, Carla Merka, with misleading investors in the sale of $20 million of municipal bonds in order to pay its outstanding construction liabilities and fund new capital projects. The SEC also charged Crosby’s auditor, Shelby Lackey, with improper professional conduct in connection with the audit of the school district’s 2017 fiscal year financial statements.

The SEC’s complaint alleges that Crosby ISD, which serves approximately 6,400 students outside of Houston, failed to report $11.7 million in payroll and construction liabilities and falsely reported having $5.4 million in general fund reserves in its audited 2017 fiscal year financial statements. According to the complaint, Crosby ISD and Merka, who was responsible for Crosby ISD’s accounting and was the primary contact during the bond financing process, were aware that the financial statements significantly underreported the payroll and construction liabilities. Crosby ISD and Merka knowingly included the false and misleading financial statements in the offering documents used to raise $20 million through the sale of municipal bonds in January 2018. In August of 2018, seven months after the offering, Crosby ISD disclosed that it was experiencing significant financial issues, including that it had a negative general fund balance. The following month, ratings agencies downgraded Crosby ISD’s bonds. 

Lackey, who audited Crosby ISD’s financial statements, authorized the issuance of the fiscal year 2017 audit report. Lackey was charged by the SEC with failure to perform critical audit procedures necessary to verify the accuracy of Crosby’s payroll and construction liabilities. She also violated Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) by failing to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the audit opinion, failing to properly supervise the audit, and by failing to exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism.

""The SEC is committed to holding bad actors in municipal securities offerings accountable for their misconduct and will continue to provide protections for investors,"" stated David Peavler, Regional Director of the SEC’s Fort Worth Regional Office.

""Crosby and Merka misled municipal bond investors regarding the truth of Crosby’s financial health, and Shelby Lackey’s deficient auditing practices further exposed investors to harm,"" said LeeAnn G. Gaunt, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit.

Crosby ISD agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by consenting, without admitting or denying any findings, to the entry of an order finding that it violated the antifraud provisions. The SEC’s complaint against Merka, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges her with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Merka agreed to pay a $30,000 penalty and not participate in any future municipal securities offerings. The settlement is subject to court approval. Lackey agreed to settle the SEC’s action, without admitting or denying any of the findings, by agreeing to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant with the right to apply for reinstatement after 3 years. Lackey also agreed to not serve as the engagement manager, engagement partner, or engagement quality control reviewer in connection with any audit expected to be posted in the MSRB’s Electronic Municipal Market Access system until reinstated by the SEC.",4,13.136884581446386

The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided guidance to assist investment advisers in fulfilling their proxy voting responsibilities. The guidance discusses, among other matters, the ability of investment advisers to establish a variety of different voting arrangements with their clients and matters they should consider when they use the services of a proxy advisory firm.  In addition, the Commission issued an interpretation that proxy voting advice provided by proxy advisory firms generally constitutes a “solicitation” under the federal proxy rules and provided related guidance about the application of the proxy antifraud rule to proxy voting advice.  Both of these actions explain the Commission’s view of various non-exclusive methods entities can use to comply with existing laws or regulations or how such laws and regulations apply.

“Voting is a key component of shareholder engagement and investing more generally,” said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.  “I’d like to thank Commissioner Elad Roisman for his leadership on our efforts to consider improvements to the proxy process, and for helping to develop this important guidance that, among other things, will provide clarity to investment advisers regarding proxy voting responsibilities, and ultimately benefit their clients.”       

“Today’s releases have benefited from the substantial engagement from the public over the past decade, including last November’s Staff Roundtable on the Proxy Process and the extensive public comments the Commission has received,” said Commissioner Roisman.  “The releases reiterate the Commission’s views on the importance of investment advisers’ voting responsibly on behalf of their clients and the applicability of our proxy rules to proxy voting advice.  Advisers who vote proxies must do so in a manner consistent with their fiduciary obligations and, to the extent they rely on voting advice from proxy advisory firms they must take reasonable steps to ensure the use of that advice is consistent with their fiduciary duties. In addition, proxy advisory firms, to the extent they engage in solicitations, must comply with applicable law.”",4,11.347540629864664

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Gladius Network LLC with conducting an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO), which the company self-reported to the SEC.  

According to the SEC’s order, Gladius conducted an ICO in late 2017, after the Commission had warned in its DAO Report of Investigation that ICOs can be securities offerings.  Gladius, a Washington, DC-based company, raised approximately $12.7 million in digital assets to finance its plan to develop a network for renting spare computer bandwidth to defend against cyberattacks and enhance delivery speed.  Gladius did not register its ICO under the federal securities laws, and the ICO did not qualify for an exemption from registration requirements. 

Gladius self-reported to the SEC’s Enforcement staff in the summer of 2018, expressed an interest in taking prompt remedial steps, and cooperated with the investigation.  The SEC did not impose a penalty because the company self-reported the conduct, agreed to compensate investors, and will register the tokens as a class of securities.  The case follows the Commission’s two recent ICO registration cases, in which companies agreed to pay penalties for similar registration violations and agreed to similar undertakings. 

“The SEC has been clear that companies must comply with the securities laws when issuing digital tokens that are securities,” said Robert A. Cohen, Chief of the SEC’s Cyber Unit.  “Today’s case shows the benefit of self-reporting and taking proactive steps to remediate unregistered offerings.”

Pursuant to the order, Gladius undertakes to return funds to those investors who purchased tokens in the ICO and request a return of funds, and register its tokens as securities pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Gladius also will file required periodic reports with the Commission.  Gladius consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings.",4,12.253318667107925
