"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today issued proposed regulationsPDF  reducing the amount determined under Internal Revenue Code section 956 for certain domestic corporations that own (or are treated as owning) stock in controlled foreign corporations (CFCs).  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in December 2017, made major changes to the tax law, including enacting a participation exemption system for the taxation of certain foreign income. The new proposed regulations are intended to ensure that the application of section 956 is consistent with the new participation exemption system. 

Treasury and IRS welcome public comments on these proposed regulations. For details on submitting comments, see the proposed regulations.

Updates on the implementation of the TCJA can be found on the Tax Reform page of IRS.gov.",0,Business/Finance
"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced the nationwide rollout of a streamlined program designed to enable small businesses under audit to more quickly settle their differences with the IRS.

The Fast Track Settlement (FTS) program is designed to help small businesses and self-employed individuals who are under examination by the Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) Division of the IRS. Modeled on a similar program long available to large and mid-size businesses (those with more than $10 million in assets), FTS uses alternative dispute resolution techniques to help taxpayers save time and avoid a formal administrative appeal or lengthy litigation. As a result, audit issues can usually be resolved within 60 days, rather than months or years. Plus, taxpayers choosing this option lose none of their rights because they still have the right to appeal even if the FTS process is unsuccessful.  

Jointly administered by SB/SE and the IRS Appeals office, FTS is designed to expedite case resolution. Under FTS, taxpayers under examination with issues in dispute work directly with IRS representatives from SB/SE’s Examination Division and Appeals to resolve those issues, with the Appeals representative typically serving as mediator.

The taxpayer or the IRS examination representative may initiate Fast Track for eligible cases, usually before a 30-day letter is issued. The goal is to complete cases within 60 days of acceptance of the application in Appeals.

SB/SE originally launched FTS as a pilot program in September 2006. For more information on taking advantage of the Fast Track Settlement program, please view the short FTS video. Additional background is available on IRS.gov on the Alternative Dispute Resolution web page and in IRS Announcement 2011-05.",0,Business
"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service announced today that taxpayers who qualify for the first-time homebuyer credit and purchase a home this year before Dec. 1 have a special option available for claiming the tax credit either on their 2008 tax returns due April 15 or on their 2009 tax returns next year.

Qualifying taxpayers who buy a home this year before Dec. 1 can get up to $8,000, or $4,000 for married filing separately.

“For first-time homebuyers this year, this special feature can put money in their pockets right now rather than waiting another year to claim the tax credit,"" said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. “This important change gives qualifying homebuyers cash they do not have to pay back.”

The IRS has posted a revised version of Form 5405, First-Time Homebuyer Credit, on IRS.gov. The revised form incorporates provisions from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The instructions to the revised Form 5405 provide additional information on who can and cannot claim the credit, income limitations and repayment of the credit.

This year, qualifying taxpayers who buy a home before Dec. 1, 2009, can claim the credit on either their 2008 or 2009 tax returns. They do not have to repay the credit, provided the home remains their main home for 36 months after the purchase date. They can claim 10 percent of the purchase price up to $8,000, or $4,000 for married individuals filing separately.

The amount of the credit begins to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income is more than $75,000, or $150,000 for joint filers.

For purposes of the credit, you are considered to be a first-time homebuyer if you, and your spouse if you are married, did not own any other main home during the three-year period ending on the date of purchase.

The IRS also alerted taxpayers that the new law does not affect people who purchased a home after April 8, 2008, and on or before Dec. 31, 2008. For these taxpayers who are claiming the credit on their 2008 tax returns, the maximum credit remains 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $7,500, or $3,750 for married individuals filing separately. In addition, the credit for these 2008 purchases must be repaid in 15 equal installments over 15 years, beginning with the 2010 tax year.",0,Finance
"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations to reflect changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on the tax deductibility of officers' compensation by publicly held corporations.

On Aug. 21, 2018, the Treasury Department and IRS released Notice 2018-68PDF. This notice provided initial guidance on this deduction limitation.

Section 162(m) disallows the deduction by any publicly held corporation for compensation paid in any  taxable year to a covered employee that exceeds $1 million. The proposed regulations update the definitions of covered employee, publicly held corporation and applicable employee compensation.

The TCJA also provided a transition, or ""grandfather"" rule, for certain outstanding compensatory arrangements. Specifically, the TCJA changes do not apply to compensation that is provided to a covered employee under a written binding contract that was in effect on Nov. 2, 2017 and was not modified on or after that date. The proposed regulations further explain the grandfather rule, including when a contract will be considered materially modified so that it is no longer considered ""grandfathered."" The TCJA changes apply to tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, except to the extent the grandfather rule applies.

Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations for tax years before the final regulations are effective.

IRS and Treasury welcome public comments. For details, see the proposed regulations now available in the Federal Register.

"WASHINGTON —– Today the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations relating to section 1031 like-kind exchanges. These final regulations address the definition of real property under section 1031 and also provide a rule addressing the receipt of personal property that is incidental to real property received in a like-kind exchange.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) limited like-kind exchange treatment to exchanges of real property. As of January 1, 2018, exchanges of personal or intangible property such as vehicles, artwork, collectibles, patents, and other intellectual property generally do not qualify for nonrecognition of gain as like-kind exchanges. Also, like-kind exchange treatment applies only to exchanges of real property held for use in a trade or business or for investment. An exchange of real property held primarily for sale does not qualify as a like-kind exchange.

Under the final regulations, real property includes land and generally anything permanently built on or attached to land. In general, real property also includes property that is characterized as real property under applicable State or local law. In addition, certain intangible property, such as leaseholds or easements, qualifies as real property under section 1031. Property not eligible for like-kind exchange treatment prior to enactment of the TCJA remains ineligible. Neither the TCJA nor the final regulations change whether the properties exchanged are of like kind.

To report a like-kind exchange, taxpayers must file Form 8824, Like-Kind Exchanges, with their tax return for the year they transfer property as part of a like-kind exchange. This form helps taxpayers figure the amount of gain deferred as a result of the like-kind exchange, as well as the basis of the like-kind property received. Form 8824 also helps taxpayers compute the amount of gain they must report if cash or property that isn't of a like-kind is involved in the exchange.",0,Business/Finance
"WASHINGTON — Approximately four hundred U.S. colleges and universities will begin receiving compliance questionnaires from the Internal Revenue Service in the next few days as part of the agency’s focused effort to study key areas in the tax-exempt community.  The college and university questionnaire will focus on unrelated business income, endowments and executive compensation practices.  The questionnaires are being sent to a cross-section of small, mid-sized and large private and public four-year colleges and institutions.

Private nonprofit universities are generally exempt from tax under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) and like state universities are subject to unrelated business income tax. 

“This effort reflects our work to build a better understanding of the largest, most complex organizations in the tax-exempt sector,” said Doug Shulman, IRS commissioner.  “The information gathered will help us identify issues and areas that may need more outreach and education or further scrutiny.”

Among other things, the questionnaire will gather information from the schools about how they report revenues and expenses from their trade or business activities, classify their activities as exempt or taxable activities, and calculate and report income or losses on taxable activities.  The questionnaire also will gather information regarding how the organization invests and uses its endowment funds and determines compensation of certain highly paid individuals.

The IRS said it expects to receive most of the responses within the next several months, analyze the results of the compliance questionnaire and conduct examinations of a sample of the organizations.  The IRS said it expects to issue a report on the project in 2009.",0,Education
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- American-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country, President Barack Obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on Thursday. Taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the Caymen Islands and Bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the United States, Obama will call on Congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government's fingers. A White House official, previewing Obama's remarks, said the President would make the case on Thursday that tax-avoiding companies ""are essentially renouncing their American citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America."" The White House has aimed this week to advance the President's domestic agenda, focusing on jobs programs and the economy. Bolstering the middle class has formed much of Obama's midterm election year pitch. But world events -- including Israel's ground invasion of Gaza and furor over the downed airliner in Ukraine -- have largely overshadowed the intended topics this week, despite the White House's attempts to highlight new job training measures. Obama's remarks Thursday, which he'll deliver at a technical college in downtown Los Angeles, come at the end of a three-day fundraising swing which also brought him to Seattle and the Silicon Valley. The event will be the only public showing for Obama during his stay on the West Coast. He withstood some criticism for not canceling the trip, which aides countered by saying the president could conduct his job from anywhere. The White House did, however, nix an appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" replacing the late night show with a more sober CNBC interview. Obama will touch on an issue Democrats believe could help them win over voters in this year's midterm contests. The President has long decried the inherent unfairness in large, multimillion dollar corporations that operate chiefly in the United States but pay little in U.S. taxes. He used the issue to attack Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Both Republicans and Democrats say the entire tax code needs an overhaul, but Obama is pressing lawmakers to take action now to prevent so-called ""inversions,"" which allow U.S. companies to merge with foreign firms in countries with lower tax rates. In the past decade, at least 47 U.S. companies have made the move. Several inversions have been proposed this year and more are in the works. ""We should prevent companies from effectively renouncing their citizenship to get out of paying taxes. What we need is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise and fall together,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew In a letter to lawmakers last week, adding he believed any new measure should prevent companies from gaining tax advantages by incorporating overseas. Lew said a new law should retroactively bar any firm that moved abroad after May 2014 from enjoying lower tax liabilities. CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.",0,Politics
"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued guidancePDF today allowing deductions for the payments of eligible expenses when such payments would result (or be expected to result) in the forgiveness of a loan (covered loan) under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

Today's guidance, Revenue Ruling 2021-02PDF, reflects changes to law contained in the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Act), Public Law 116-260, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020.

The COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020 amended the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to say that no deduction is denied, no tax attribute is reduced, and no basis increase is denied by reason of the exclusion from gross income of the forgiveness of an eligible recipient's covered loan. This change applies for taxable years ending after March 27, 2020.

Revenue Ruling 2021-02 obsoletes Notice 2020-32 and Revenue Ruling 2020-27. This obsoleted guidance disallowed deductions for the payment of eligible expenses when the payments resulted (or could be expected to result) in forgiveness of a covered loan.",0,Business/Finance
"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service, in response to disruptions resulting from Hurricane Ian, will not impose a penalty when dyed diesel fuel with a sulfur content that does not exceed 15 parts-per-million is sold for use or used by emergency vehicles on the highway in the state of Florida.

This relief begins on September 28, 2022, and will remain in effect through October 19, 2022.

This penalty relief is available to any person that sells or uses dyed diesel fuel in an emergency vehicle for highway use. In the case of the operator of the emergency vehicle in which the dyed diesel fuel is used, the relief is available only if the operator or the person selling such fuel pays the tax of 24.4 cents per gallon that is normally applied to diesel fuel for highway use.

The IRS will not impose penalties for failure to make semimonthly deposits of tax for dyed diesel fuel sold for use or used in an emergency vehicle on the highway in the state of Florida during the relief period. IRS Publication 510, Excise Taxes, has information on the proper method for reporting and paying the tax.

Ordinarily, dyed diesel fuel is not taxed, because it is sold for uses exempt from excise tax, such as to farmers for farming purposes, for home heating use, and to local governments.

The IRS is closely monitoring the situation and will provide additional relief as needed.",0,Business

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old boy has been detained by Bahraini authorities for nearly a month for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" and for burning tires, an arrest that human rights groups say comes amid the country's continued crackdown on anti-government protesters. Rights groups on Saturday demanded the release of the boy, Ali Hasan, following news that Bahrain's Juvenile Court ordered the youth moved from a jail to a juvenile detention facility. Hasan was arrested on May 14 by Bahraini authorities for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" with about a dozen others, according to the Bahrain International Affairs Authority, the kingdom's information office. Specifically, the boy was involved with burning tires at a roadblock, the office said. ""The juvenile is receiving social care and tutoring at the center. He completed his last exam of the sixth grade level on Thursday,"" the information office said in a statement, which identified the boy as being 12 years old. But an attorney for Hasan's family disputes the government account, saying the boy was playing with two other children in the street when he was stopped by police. The attorney, Shahzalan Khamees, said that police stopped Hasan and two other boys, who managed to run away. Khamees said Hasan claims the police threatened to shoot him with a pellet gun if he ran. The boy, according to Khamees, was then detained for questioning. A second defense attorney, Mohsin Al-Alawi, said he recently visited Hasan and that the boy told him that he didn't take part in an ""illegal gathering."" The boy sobbed, said he is tired and wants to go home, Al-Alawi said. The Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization, an Ireland-based rights group, demanded Hasan's immediate release. There are a ""growing number of children detained for investigation in security cases,"" the group said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights expressed concern about the government's targeting of children under the age of 15 in its crackdown. The rights group said Hasan, who they claim is 11, was the youngest detainee in Bahrain's prison system. The government did not immediately respond to the allegation. Bahrain has been heavily criticized by rights groups for its crackdown on anti-government protests that began February 14, 2011, in the country -- spurred by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the protests failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings following a crackdown in February and then again in mid-March by Bahraini authorities -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash, with the opposition accusing the government of being heavy handed in its crackdown on protests. In November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report highly critical of the crackdown. The commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture during last year's crackdown on protests. The report recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.",1,World News
"Atlanta (CNN) -- Police have found the body of a 7-year-old Georgia girl who went missing more than two days ago, the state's chief law enforcement official said Monday. Police believe Jorelys Rivera was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered at her apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Director Vernon Keenan. ""This is going to be a very, very horrendous crime. I am convinced of that after having observed the body. A child death is always a terrible thing, but a child who dies under extreme violence is the absolute worst thing,"" he told reporters. An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death, Keenan said. The girl was last seen Friday near a playground at her apartment. Police initially thought she might have wandered off, but after more than 48 hours of searching, they said they believed the girl was kidnapped. Canton police, assisted by the FBI and the GBI, expanded the search area Monday and began canvassing for sex offenders living nearby. They are now asking for help to find out who killed the little girl. Her body was found in a dumpster at the apartment complex where she lived. ""We need help from the public,"" said Police Chief Jeff Lance. As of Monday afternoon, Keenan said, investigators were actively pursuing leads, but police had no one in custody and no suspects. ""Quite frankly, at this point we do not have a strong suspect. We've not focused in on anyone. We very much need information from the public who may know something about the abduction of this child,"" said Keenan. State troopers were stopping and talking to everyone entering, leaving or driving by the apartment complex Monday afternoon. Earlier, as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child, her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children, who were taken by the Department of Family and Children's Services for alleged lack of supervision. The girl's parents are not suspects, Keenan said. Joselin Rivera had spoken with local media hours after her young daughter went missing Friday, saying she just wanted her returned safely. After the girl's body was found, neighbors said they feared for their safety. Speaking in Spanish, Luis Fernando Montenegro said he was concerned for his daughter, who attends night school. ""If she (Rivera) was abducted here and her body was also found here in the (apartment) complex, how do we know the killer is not still here?"" he asked.

"(CNN) -- Police in Oakland, California, took a 43-year-old former student at a small religious college into custody Monday after a shooting spree at the school that left seven dead and three wounded, the city's police chief said. The motive behind the killings at Oikos University in East Oakland remained a mystery Monday night, Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told reporters. Detectives had not yet questioned the suspect, identified as One Goh, and no charges had been filed, he said. ""With a case of this magnitude, with all the victims and witnesses and all the chaos, it's going to take a few days to put the pieces together,"" Jordan said. The college, which caters to the Korean American Christian community, offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said most of the victims appeared to be from the city's Korean-American community, and the city was working to find multilingual counselors to help survivors. ""No American mayor wants to have this situation,"" she said. ""It seems over the last decade, we've gotten used to seeing senseless mass killings like this, and we'll have to question the availability of guns and the need for other services in our community."" What is Oikos University? Gunfire erupted inside the single-story building that houses the private Christian college about 10:30 a.m. A witness, Brian Snow, said he was at a nearby credit union when shots rang out, ""and it started getting chaotic."" ""In Oakland, sometimes things like that happen, but it dies over,"" he said. But this time, he said, ""I went outside and the cops were coming and like 'Don't move, don't move,' and it started getting chaotic ... a pedestrian came out with a bullet hole and I was like, 'Getting really crazy right now.' "" Lucas Garcia, who was teaching an English class at the college when the rampage began, told CNN affiliate KGO-TV that he counted about six gunshots from a nearby nursing classroom. Garcia said he heard someone yell, ""He's got a gun,"" and he got his students out of the building while the gunfire continued. Jordan said the relationship between the suspect and any of those shot remained unknown Monday night, as detectives combed over ""a very bloody scene with lots of evidence."" ""Initially, we were told he was in a classroom when he stood up and began shooting at the victims,"" Jordan said. Several of the survivors, including the wounded, hid behind locked doors or desks as the shooting went on. The suspect took one of the victims' cars and drove off, but surrendered to police at a Safeway grocery in the Oakland suburb of Alameda a short time later, Jordan said. California Gov. Jerry Brown, who served as Oakland's mayor from 1999 to 2007, called the killings ""shocking and sad.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Mississippi are holding a father of five in the deaths of his children, ages 1 to 8, the state's Department of Public Safety said Tuesday evening. ""The seriousness of this violent crime is unconscionable,"" said Albert Santa Cruz, Mississippi's public safety commissioner. Timothy Jones Jr., 32, is being held in Smith County on child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution.

Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Jones led law enforcement to the crime scene, Jarrett said. No other details were immediately available about how the children died. A multi-state search for the children and their father involved the FBI and state law enforcement agencies.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Three of four minors accused of taking part in a brutal videotaped gang rape of a teenager will face full prosecution, a spokesman for a South African court said Wednesday. The boys appeared in court Wednesday -- along with three others who are not minors -- to apply for bail. The seven suspects are between the ages of 13 and 19. A bail hearing will be held May 3 for the minors and June 20 for the adults, said the spokesman, Mthunzi Mhaga. It is unlikely that the suspects, accused of a crime that has shocked many in South Africa, will be granted bail, officials have said. An eighth suspect -- a man who was found with the victim -- is scheduled to appear in court on May 4, court officials said. The images of the assault of the 17-year-old girl, believed to be mentally ill, swept across the Internet last week and touched a nerve in South Africa. The shocking footage shows the girl pleading for her attackers to stop, and it has some activists saying it is an example of the country's problem with rape. The girl went missing on March 21. Police suspect she was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave. The cell phone video of her gang rape surfaced and went viral among schoolchildren in Soweto, a vast township near Johannesburg. The Daily Sun, a local tabloid, alerted police about the attack after a concerned mother whose daughter was watching the video handed it over to the newspaper. Police embarked on a search for the girl and the people in the video. Eight suspects have been arrested and charged with kidnapping and raping the teen. Seven of them were seen on the video; the other was a 37-year-old man found with the girl last week. A woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, according to local aid groups. More than 60,000 cases of sexual assault were reported in the year to March 2011, down from 70,000 in 2008, police said. Women's rights activist Lisa Vetten says in the province of Gauteng, where Johannesburg is located, one in every five rapes is a gang rape. ""Rape is a young man's crime,"" she said. ""It's a bit of a performance for them, showing off to each other how macho they are. We need to teach our young men that you can be masculine in ways that do not involve violence and degrading women."" The mother of the 17-year-old has said this was not the first time her daughter has been raped. She was raped in 2009 and 2010, and authorities have done little to address the issue in the past, the mother said. ""It's 2012 now, and I'm still waiting for DNA results,"" she said. After the girl was found and as the news of the video emerged, the government placed her in a safe house -- a place where she can attend school and socialize in a secure environment. ""They are coming now because things have turned out this way,"" the mother said. ""They shouldn't pretend as if they have been standing up for me. They never stood up for me.""",1,News
"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the Oscar Pistorius murder case will make a final push Friday to keep the acclaimed track star in jail after a bail hearing jolted by the sudden removal of the lead investigator. The South African Police Service pulled Hilton Botha from the case Thursday after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him. Botha is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk in 2011. He is charged with seven counts of attempted murder. The allegations were the latest blow to a prosecution case that has suffered through several miscues during the bail hearing, including admissions that police could have contaminated the crime scene and failed to properly catalog evidence. Prosecutors are trying to keep Pistorius jailed pending his trial on a charge of premeditated murder in the February 14 shooting death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, 29. The hearing ended Thursday with no decision on bail and is scheduled to resume Friday. Pistorius, 26, is accused of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp after, according to prosecutors, a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The sprinter, however, says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired into the room in a fit of terror before realizing the person inside was Steenkamp. Replacing Botha . Court officials learned Thursday that prosecutors had restored the charges against Botha in the 2011 incident. The charges had previously been withdrawn for additional investigation, but prosecutors decided Wednesday to proceed, said Commissioner Riah Phiyega of the South African Police Service. Phiyega praised Botha, saying he is an experienced investigator who ""has presented the case of the police well."" Botha was replaced by the department's most senior detective, Vinesh Moonoo, in a move Phiyega said positioned the department for a ""long-haul"" investigation of Steenkamp's killing. During the three-day bail hearing, being held in a dark, stuffy Pretoria courtroom, defense attorney Barry Roux hammered away at the credibility of Botha and the entire police investigation. He argued police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where Steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers. Botha told Roux that investigators didn't wear the booties because they'd run out. Bulelwa Makeke, the spokeswoman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, said before the announcement of Botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a ""speed bump"" in the Pistorius case.

In arguments wrapping up Thursday's session, Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius' defense team has failed to explain why investigators found two cell phones and the gun believed to have been used in the shooting in front of the shower. That goes to the prosecution claim that Steenkamp didn't merely get up to relieve herself in the middle of the night, but in fact had locked herself in the bathroom with her cell phone to protect herself from Pistorius. Nel also said Pistorius has shown a lack of realization of what he has done and cast doubt on Pistorius' claims that one of the reasons for his extreme fear that night was that he had been a victim of burglary and violent crime in the past. Where, Nel asked, are the court cases from those incidents? Why, Nel asked, didn't Pistorius whisper to Steenkamp or try to wake her up when he heard noises? In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court . In addition to his questions about the bullet and the booties, Roux got Botha to acknowledge during the hearing that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. Roux told Magistrate Desmond Nair that the prosecution's case had suffered a monumental collapse. The defense attorney also questioned police claims that a witness who lived at least 300 meters (328 yards) from Pistorius' home had heard a raging argument coming from the home. He also said officers had failed to properly investigate and catalog evidence found there, including ammunition and a bottle of what Botha first called testosterone before backtracking. Roux said the substance is an herbal remedy. Authorities have argued that ballistic evidence shows Pistorius had to intentionally target the toilet to strike Steenkamp, and that evidence shows he was standing on his prosthetic legs when he shot through the bathroom door. Pistorius said in his statement that when he shot through the door, he was feeling vulnerable to an intruder because he was not wearing his legs and had limited mobility. Prosecutors are fighting bail because they worry that Pistorius will disappear if he's released, and they say that he has a history of police encounters that suggest he is a threat to public safety. Pistorius has pledged to stay in South Africa and fight the charges if released, adding that he's unlikely to escape notice as a well-known athlete who walks on prosthetic legs. His family issued a statement Thursday afternoon through Vuna Reputation Management, saying that they ""fully respect the bail hearing process."" ""They understand it is in the full interest of justice that the process associated with the bail application be followed in its entirety"", said Arnold Pistorius, Oscar Pistorius' uncle and family spokesperson. ""We are strong and supportive as a family, for Oscar, but we understand that this is in the best interest for all."" Anger about detention . In other developments, the women's branch of South Africa's ruling party accused authorities of giving Pistorius special treatment by holding him at the police station instead of prison. ""If there is some special circumstance that permits this, authorities must share this with the public as they are setting a bad precedent,"" the statement from the African National Congress Women's League said. ""All should be treated equally before the law no matter your standing in society."" What's life like in a South African prison? Nike pulls away from sprinter .

"(CNN) -- Survivors of a mass shooting attack in Norway returned Saturday for the first time to the island where a gunman went on a rampage a month ago, killing 69 people. More than 1,000 people are expected to visit Utoya island Saturday, state broadcaster NRK said. Television footage showed young people picking their way along the shoreline and spreading across the small island. Many of those who survived did so by hiding among rocks and vegetation or swimming out into the chilly waters around the island. The survivors' visit comes a day after relatives of those killed were allowed to travel to the island for the first time to see where their loved ones' final moments were spent. Police officers were at hand to point out to the families exactly where those killed were found. Many lit candles and left flowers in makeshift shrines, local media reported. Several hundred people were attending a political summer camp held by the youth wing of the governing Labour Party at the time of the July 22 shooting attack. Many of those killed were teenagers. NRK said Saturday's visit was the first time many of the young people had seen one another since the traumatic events a month ago. The island remains a crime scene, as police investigate the mass shooting and the bombing of Oslo government buildings on the same day, which claimed the lives of eight more people . The suspect in both attacks, Anders Breivik, was ordered held in isolation for four more weeks Friday after appearing before a judge in Oslo. Giving his ruling, the judge said Breivik should continue to be held in solitary confinement because there was a real danger otherwise that he would tamper with evidence and hinder the police investigation. Breivik, 32, had told the court that being held in isolation is ""boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture,"" the judge said. Breivik admitted the attacks, a judge and his lawyer say, but has pleaded not guilty in court. Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby, of Oslo Police District, told reporters Friday that 400 witnesses had now been questioned in connection with the two attacks. Breivik will face further interrogation this week, he said. CNN's Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.",1,National News
"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- Inside a Mexican jail, Yanira Maldonado wept. A devout Mormon, the Arizona mother of seven said Wednesday she's been turning to scripture to survive ever since authorities falsely accused her of drug smuggling last week. ""Reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help."" A judge is weighing whether to set Maldonado free after authorities accused her of drug smuggling and alleged they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Maldonado maintained her innocence Wednesday. ""I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have,"" she said. ""You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people."" The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday, but didn't show, according to a defense attorney. Hearings in the case are set to continue Friday. Maldonado's family denies the charges and says they're optimistic the case against her is crumbling. ""We have high hopes,"" Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, told CNN on Wednesday. ""So I'm just looking forward to that. Hopefully, Friday, I'm praying that she will be home and be set free."" It's a situation Maldonado said she never imagined when she boarded a bus last week to head back to the United States after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico. ""I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,"" she said. ""And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did."" Fearing for her life . Earlier this week, Maldonado's cuffed hands gripped a metal bar as a truck carrying her to testify barreled down the street. One thought went through her mind, she told CNN, crying as she recalled her fear that the fast-moving Mexican police convoy would crash. ""I'm not a killer. I'm not a criminal. I'm just here by mistake because people are not doing their work,"" she said. ""This is not right. I need to be back with my family. I need to be out of here. I need help."" Since her arrest, Maldonado said her views toward the country where she was born have changed drastically. Asked before by friends about going south of the border, Maldonado never thought twice when she gave advice. ""I used to tell people, 'Come to Mexico. It's not true what they're saying. I go every year to visit my family. ... I come, I drive myself, nothing happens.' ... Look what's happening to me now. I cannot say that anymore,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""I don't want anybody to go through this."" If she's released from prison, Maldonado says she's not sure whether she'll ever return to Mexico. From a bus seat to a jail cell . Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. Another daughter, Brenda Pedraza, called the arrest ""outrageous."" Her mother was recently by her side, she said, cradling her newborn granddaughter. ""She's just a wonderful mom and a wonderful grandma and she would never jeopardize her life to lose this, to lose her family,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. The family relies on Maldonado and misses her, Pedraza said. ""I still need her, you know, being a new mom. I still need her advice, her guidance. We've heard that the minimum is 10 years. Ten years is a whole lifespan. We don't have that time, 10 years, to be separated,"" Pedraza said, choking back tears. ""Please, to the officials in Mexico, please do your part and really investigate, because I know my mom has nothing to do with those illegal drugs."" After testifying in court on Tuesday, Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic. ""We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,"" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest . A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. ""Can you imagine?"" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. ""A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed."" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay $5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. U.S. officials monitoring the case . Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, is monitoring the case, his office said. The State Department has also been in touch with the family. ""The U.S. Consulate in Nogales is monitoring the case closely,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. ""They are in regular contact with Ms. Maldonado and her family, and her legal counsel, and they're working to schedule another visit with her. The last time we were able to visit with her was May 24."" The State Department estimates that several thousand U.S. citizens are arrested in Mexico each year. But it's unclear exactly how many U.S. citizens have been detained in Mexico, the State Department said. ""We don't have the exact breakdown for Mexico, and the embassy would not have that information either,"" said Elizabeth A. Finan, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affiairs. ""However, I can say millions of U.S. citizens travel to Mexico each year, and most have uneventful trips. Arrests happen every day, as you might expect with such a high volume of visitors."" Some arrests go unreported to U.S. officials, and sometimes arrested individuals do not request consular assistance, Finan wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Arrest cases are not uncommon in Mexico,"" she said, ""and our consular officers work hard to assist all U.S. citizens who come to us for help.""

"(CNN) -- Prince William and his wife, Catherine, will visit a fire-stricken town in central Alberta on Wednesday, the seventh day of their Canadian tour. Slave Lake was devastated by a May wildfire that destroyed homes and other structures. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will meet emergency services personnel from the fire brigade, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the medical response team in the town before visiting with families affected by the disaster. Later Wednesday, the royal couple will head to Calgary, Alberta, for a series of events Thursday and Friday. William and Catherine are expected to visit a total of four provinces and one territory during their nine-day tour -- their first official foreign trip as a married couple. On Tuesday, William and Catherine made the northernmost stops of their journey when they visited sites in the Northwest Territories. The couple took in customary aboriginal activities, including traditional drumming, dancing and sports, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Afterward, William and Catherine spoke at a session of Youth Parliament and met with aboriginal elders and young adults from the Northwest Territories. On Monday, William and Catherine toured Prince Edward Island, racing in dueling dragon boats and visiting Province House, the second-oldest active legislature building in Canada. Afterward, the couple headed to Dalvay-by-the-Sea. There, Prince William -- a military helicopter pilot by training -- joined his Canadian counterparts in taking part in a ""waterbird"" emergency landing in a nearby lake. In the exercise, which was originated by Canadian armed forces for use in search-and-rescue missions, the helicopter's engine is cut off and it then lands in the water. When it is about one-quarter submerged, the propellers are restarted to bring the helicopter back toward the sky. The Prince Edward Island visit came a day after the most controversial stop on their tour in the French-speaking province of Quebec. William and Catherine attended a ""Freedom of the City"" ceremony at Quebec City Hall, where the prince addressed the crowd in French after being met by cheering supporters. Nearby, a small but vocal group of anti-monarchy protesters gathered. Quebec's relationship with the monarchy has often been strained, with the queen met by booing protesters on a visit to the province in 1964. The royal couple also visited Maison Dauphine, a center that provides assistance to troubled street youth in Quebec. They posed for pictures and seemed at ease as artists showed off their work. The prince played a quick game of foosball. The duke and duchess started their Canadian tour last Thursday in Ottawa, Ontario. After they wrap up their tour on Friday, the duke and duchess will head to California for three days. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.",2,Royal News
"(CNN) -- Bush fires blazing in Australia's New South Wales claimed their first victim Friday after a man died of a suspected heart attack defending his home against the blaze on the NSW Central Coast. Australian media reports said Walter Lindner, 63, collapsed while battling alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead. He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Authorities say hundreds of homes have been lost with the worst hit areas in the Blue Mountains, a World Heritage area to the west of Sydney, sending thick plumes of smoke into the air. Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service. Earlier Thursday, the fire service tweeted that 34 blazes were still out of control. More than 100 firefighters were battling flames in Heatherbrae, where one fire has so far destroyed 3,500 hectares (8,649 acres), the service said. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell warned at a news conference Thursday that hundreds of homes could be destroyed by the time the crisis is over. He paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency responders battling the flames. ""Today's conditions, both the hot, dry conditions but also the wind conditions, have contributed to the difficulties faced by firefighters and communities on the ground,"" he said. ""This difficult, damaging and dangerous day and these conditions are not going to be over quickly,"" he said. ""Weather conditions are changing. It will take some days to see the end of these fires, and I suspect if we get through that without the loss of life, we should thank God for miracles."" Footage broadcast by CNN affiliate Seven Network showed flames consuming homes. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has issued emergency warnings for the most risky situations. They include the State Mine Fire, a large bush fire moving from Lithgow toward Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, which has burned more than 20,000 hectares (more than 49,000 acres) of bushland, firefighters said. Another blaze threatens homes in the Springwood area of the Blue Mountains.",2,National News
"(CNN) -- Inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in Georgia that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak, according to reports released Monday by the state Department of Agriculture. A salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people, the CDC says. But the owner of the Blakely, Georgia, plant -- Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America -- described the problems as ""relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" PCA this month stopped production at the Blakely plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after July 1, 2008. The New York Times reported Monday that Georgia agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the Blakely plant. Citing an inspection report from August 23, 2007, the Times noted at least three incidences in which ""food-contact surfaces"" were ""not properly cleaned and sanitized."" In an apparent response to the Times article, PCA released a statement saying, ""When the observations were noted during inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible."" The statement, which PCA sent to CNN accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last October, said ""the most recent inspection observations by the state [the October inspection report] were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" In the October 23, 2008 report, an inspector said she found ""mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room."" The report did not specify the amount of mildew. The report continued with the notation, ""Correct By: 11/05/2008,"" but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow-up inspection occurred. Moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago. That outbreak was traced to a different Georgia peanut processing plant. A June 2008 inspection of PCA's Blakely plant found violations including dust buildup on a fan in the butter room, and ""possible metal flakes from metal scrubber which is used to clean outside of equipment,"" according to an inspection report. The report did not indicate where the flakes were found. PCA has said that the peanut butter and peanut paste made at the Blakely plant were sold in bulk to manufacturers, and that the recall does not involve any peanut butter jars sold directly to consumers. However, more than 125 products that include peanut butter or peanut paste, including Trader Joe's celery with peanut butter packs and nutrition bars from Clif Bar, NutriSystem and Luna, have been recalled in connection with the PCA's recall. See a list of recalled products . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted nearly 500 cases of salmonella illnesses in 43 states from the most recent outbreak, and says the bacterial infection might have contributed to seven deaths. The American Peanut Council has a list of peanut products that are not affected by the recall.",2,Health
"Miami (CNN) -- An eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the Florida Keys last week, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the ""scariest thing"" that's ever happened to her, she said. The woman, Jenny Hausch, was on the chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water. ""These eagle rays, they were flying through the air,"" said Kelly Klein of Two Chicks Charters, the captain of the boat. ""These giant things go out of the water and slam back down."" Hausch said she was in the front of the boat, snapping away. ""The first picture I took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us,"" she said. When the ray jumped again, Hausch said she was readying her camera. ""Next thing I know, it hit me square in the chest. I fell backwards and fell down,"" she said. Klein said the ray kept ""slamming and slamming on top of (Hausch), trying to swim away."" Hausch said the incident happened so fast that she didn't have time to react. ""I was just trying to push it off me as I was scooting backwards,"" she said. Hausch's husband and children watched in horror. Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers Aja Vickers and Bret Swensson were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams. ""We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem,"" said Vickers. As the officers made their way to the boat, Vickers said, ""shoes were getting thrown off the boat, towels were going everywhere."" By the time officers made it to the boat Hausch had freed herself from under the ray. Klein said the animal measured 8-feet across, and probably weighed a good 300 pounds. ""It's just massive, it has a 10-foot tail,"" she added. Klein said everyone thought that Hausch was dead, but when she was freed she didn't have a scratch on her. Hausch said it was the scariest thing that's ever happened to her, and she's thankful she didn't get hurt. Hausch's children were hysterical, but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident wouldn't make them afraid of the water. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds. In 2008, a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys, but Vickers said both incidents were freak accidents. ""This is a total one-in-a-million chance,"" she said. ""These animals aren't attacking by any means. One theory is these animals jump during mating season.""",2,Local News
"(CNN) -- The nation's new ""first dog"" has heightened interest in its breed -- Portuguese water dog -- but not necessarily a thorough understanding of the dogs' needs, a pair of owners and breeders told CNN. Bo the Portuguese water dog meets the camera. Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy. The dog, Bo, has triggered ""the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s,"" the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release. President Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club's Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member. Jane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has ""received about a 10 percent increase in calls"" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls. ""Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed,"" Teasley said. ""But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research."" Portuguese water dogs are ""active athletes,"" far from couch potatoes, she explained. In fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun » . Portuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said. And don't think you can close the door and keep them out. ""They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,"" she said. Teasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are ""not apartment dogs,"" she said. Harding agreed. ""They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,"" she joked, ""we recommend a stuffed dog."" Portuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers. Harding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because ""they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work."" For other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, ""Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed."" Teasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the ""Dalmatian syndrome."" After the movie ""101 Dalmatians"" came out in 1996, ""thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,"" Teasley said. What those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said. Both Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog » . ""For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,"" Harding said. She has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said ""produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles"" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America. Such organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit. ""It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),"" Teasley said, ""But I'm not. We just don't want dogs to come back because owners don't know what they are doing.""",2,Lifestyle
"MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- A moderately strong earthquake rocked Mexico City on Friday afternoon, shaking the earth in the sprawling capital. People in Mexico City stream into the street as a magnitude 5.7 earthquake hits. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 5.7, and placed the epicenter near the city of Puebla, about 85 miles southeast of Mexico City. It hit at 2:24 p.m. local time. The Mexican seismological service measured the quake at 5.9. People in the city reported the earth and buildings shaking. Thousands of panicked people streamed into the streets as stopped cars snarled traffic. Parts of the city were without electricity Friday afternoon but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Earthquakes are a frightening experience for the 20 million residents of Mexico City, where thousands of people perished in a massive quake in 1985. The city, built on volcanic ash and clay, is particularly vulnerable to temblors. Aldo Pontecorvo of the humanitarian agency World Vision said the shaking lasted about 20 seconds.

"(CNN) -- Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, a company spokeswoman said. The certification tests come two months after a fire on board one of the planes caused a power failure during a test flight. Boeing halted tests after the November 9 incident. Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter. Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world. The Dreamliner is Boeing's next-generation passenger jet. It is touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials. Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November. The crew used backup systems to land the aircraft. Engineers determined the problem started as a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel, most likely caused by foreign debris, Boeing said.",2,Business
"Tokyo (CNN) -- U.S. Navy personnel are taking precautionary measures after instruments aboard an aircraft carrier docked in Japan detected low levels of radioactivity from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, the Navy said Tuesday. The USS George Washington was docked for maintenance in Yokosuka, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the plant in Okuma, when instruments detected the radiation at 7 a.m. Tuesday (6 p.m. ET Monday), the Navy said in a statement. Personnel will limit outdoor activities and secure external ventilation systems there and at a nearby air facility in Atsugi. ""There is no appreciable health risk, and we are being very conservative in our recommendations,"" U.S. Naval Forces Japan Commander Rear Adm. Richard Wren said. In a recorded video message, Wren said the additional radiation exposure over the past 12 hours had been less than one month's exposure to naturally occurring background radiation. Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned Tuesday that the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the plant remains ""very high."" Radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors. But radiation levels at the plant increased Tuesday to ""levels that can impact human health,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The announcement came after an explosion at the plant's No. 2 reactor. In addition, Edano said, the building housing the No. 4 unit -- which had been shut down before Friday's earthquake -- was burning Tuesday morning, . On Monday the Navy said it was repositioning ships after tests had detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members that had been conducting disaster relief missions in Japan. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. The Navy's Monday statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by ship personnel when it passed through the area was ""less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)The Indonesian military said Tuesday that it was stopping its efforts to recover the remains of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 almost a month after the commercial jet crashed into the sea. Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Basarnas, will continue its work to try to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site in the Java Sea, the head of the agency, Bambang Soelistyo, said Wednesday. The military provided the majority of personnel and hardware involved in the recovery operation, which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems. ""We are really disappointed,"" Imam Sampurno, whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found, said of the military's announcement. ""We really hope the evacuation process is still going."" Basarnas said it would have 60 divers, eight salvage experts, seven boats, two helicopters and a fixed-wing plane taking part in the continued search efforts, which will resume Saturday after the teams take a rest. Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board. So far, searchers have managed to recover 70 bodies from the sea, leaving 92 still unaccounted for. Over the weekend, navy divers tried to lift part of the fuselage of the plane using wire ropes and giant balloons. But the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke. An effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful, the military said. ""Our main priority is to find the bodies. We are not going to focus on lifting the fuselage,"" Soelistyo said Wednesday about the future search plans. The chief of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Moeldoko, on Tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out, said military spokesman Manahan Simorangkir. Officials said that 19 of the 81 navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with decompression sickness and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in Jakarta, the capital. ""I told them safety first. But as we know, soldiers, they are always working hard to find the bodies,"" said Rear Adm. Widodo, commander of the Indonesian Navy's western fleet. ""They are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty."" The divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage, Widodo said. Officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage. But Widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the seafloor. Searchers have recovered at least 14 bodies from the fuselage site, including some that floated free during attempts to lift the wreckage, according to officials. Indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why Flight QZ8501 went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely. Investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight augmentation computers (FACs) played a role in what went wrong, the news agency Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. The FAC helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft, keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure adjustments to the rudder are smooth. It also warns pilots if they try to manually push the plane beyond its capabilities. Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200, had two FACs, one serving as a backup. Indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water. The reason for the sharp ascent is unclear, but aviation analysts say the FAC could have recognized trouble and, at a critical moment, automatically shifted full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis. Investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash, officials said Tuesday. But authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan told CNN on Monday that the final report into the disaster should be published in less than a year. ""It won't be a year, that's my promise,"" he said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff reported from Jakarta, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- At least 73 people are dead and more than 21,000 people homeless after Tropical Storm Irina struck Madagascar, an official with the nation's disaster bureau said Wednesday. One person has been injured, and two more are missing, according to Setra Rakotomandrindra of the National Bureau of Natural Catastrophes. About 21,235 people are homeless, he said, and a total of 67,911 people have been affected, mostly in the southeastern part of the island nation. The government was using tents to house those who need shelter, he said. Irina was Madagascar's second violent storm in two weeks, according to the IRIN news agency, a service of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Cyclone Giovanna wreaked havoc on Madagascar last month, IRIN said. But ""while most people had been warned of Giovanna's destructive potential, Irina took the Indian Ocean island largely by surprise, destroying roads and houses already weakened by the first cyclone."" More than 100 people have died during the nation's current cyclone season, which usually runs from January to March, IRIN said. Most of the casualties were in the southeastern town of Ifanadiana, where a mudslide swallowed homes and caused a traffic accident involving a minibus, according to IRIN. Main roads in Madagascar have been reopened as of Wednesday, Rakotomandrindra said. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.",2,World News
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton on Saturday will officially suspend her campaign for the presidency and ""express her support for Senator Obama and party unity,"" her campaign said Wednesday. Sen. Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she will let her supporters and party leaders decide her course. The Clinton campaign said she will make the announcement at ""an event in Washington, D.C.,"" where she will also  thank her supporters. Sen. Barack Obama and Clinton were in Washington on Wednesday to each address the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The candidates ran into each other at the AIPAC conference and had a brief chat, Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass said. ""She's an extraordinary leader of the Democratic Party and has made history alongside me over the last 16 months. I'm very proud to have competed against her,"" Obama told the Israel lobbying group. Obama became his party's presumptive nominee Tuesday and will be looking to unite Democrats divided by the long and contentious primary season. ""I am very confident how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November,"" he said in a Senate hallway Wednesday. iReport.com: Obama/Clinton -- dream team or nightmare? Some say that putting Clinton on the ticket might fit the bill for uniting Democrats. Clinton lavished her opponent with praise Tuesday, saying he ran an ""extraordinary race"" and made politics more palatable for many.  Watch how the primary played out » . Prominent Clinton backer Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, thinks the New York senator could have been ""far more generous"" during her speech Tuesday night after it was clear that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination. Rangel, the senior member of the New York congressional delegation and an early supporter of Clinton's presidential campaign, said Wednesday that Clinton should have been more clear about what her plans are. ""I would agree that after the math was in before her speech, that she could have been far more generous in terms of being more specific and saying that she wants a Democratic victory,"" Rangel said on MSNBC. ""I don't see what they're talking about in prolonging this,"" Rangel added. ""There's nothing to prolong if you're not going to take the fight to the convention floor. ... I don't know why she could not have been more open in terms of doing up front what she intends to do later."" But with some Democrats clamoring for her to join Obama on the ticket, and with the Democratic National Convention -- and thus, the official anointment -- still more than two months out, the senator from New York gave no hint as to her plans.  See VP prospects' pros, cons » . She again invoked the popular vote, saying she snared ""more votes than any primary candidate in history,"" but primaries come down to delegates, and according to CNN calculations, Obama has her beaten, 2,156 to 1,923. Even the White House seemed convinced of Obama's victory. White House press secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday that President Bush congratulated Obama on becoming the first black nominee from a major party. She said his win shows that the United States ""has come a long way."" Clinton vowed to keep fighting for an end to the war in Iraq, for universal health care, for a stronger economy and better energy policy, but she didn't indicate in what capacity she would wage these battles. That, she said, would be up to her supporters and the party brass.  See what lies in store this fall » . The party's best interests were high on the minds of party leaders Wednesday, as Sen. Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin and DNC Chairman Howard Dean called on Democrats to focus on the general election. ""To that end, we are urging all remaining uncommitted superdelegates to make their decisions known by Friday of this week so that our party can stand united and begin our march toward reversing the eight years of failed Bush/McCain policies that have weakened our country,"" said a statement from the four. Billionaire businessman Bob Johnson, a close Clinton adviser and friend, said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday that Obama could best forge party unity by offering Clinton the vice presidential slot. A day after the final two primaries in South Dakota and Montana, Johnson sent a letter to House Majority Whip James Clyburn to lobby the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Clinton as Obama's running mate. Saying Clinton would ""entertain the idea if it's offered,"" Johnson said, ""This is Sen. Obama's decision. If the Congress members can come together and agree as I do that it would be in the best interest of the party to have Sen. Clinton on the ticket, they carry that petition to Sen. Obama.""  Watch how the world reacted to Obama's win » . ""This is not a pressure. This is elected officials giving their best judgment,"" said Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Johnson's letter to Clyburn says, ""You know as well as I the deep affection that millions of African-Americans hold for both Senator Clinton and President Clinton."" It continues, ""But most important, we need to have the certainty of winning; and, I believe, without question, that Barack Obama as president and Hillary Clinton as vice president bring that certainty to the ticket.""  Watch Johnson urge Obama to pick Clinton » . Johnson is one of many influential Clinton supporters who have raised the prospect of her joining Obama on the ticket. They say she has solid credentials and wide appeal, exemplified by her popular support in states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, which will be crucial to a Democratic victory in the fall. Obama and Clinton spoke by phone for a few minutes Wednesday. He told her he wants to ""sit down when it makes sense"" for her, said Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs. Clinton said that would happen soon, Gibbs said, but he also said Obama did not raise the issue of the vice presidency. Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe confirmed that there had been ""absolutely zero discussions"" on the matter. The Clinton campaign issued a statement saying she was open to becoming vice president. ""She would do whatever she could to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain,"" the statement said.

"Washington (CNN) -- If the Bush administration had known there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it probably wouldn't have decided to invade in 2003, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in an interview broadcast Sunday. Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, Rumsfeld noted there were multiple reasons for attacking Iraq and ousting Saddam Hussein from power. However, intelligence reports -- now shown to have been false -- that Iraq possessed WMDs were the main reason for going in, Rumsfeld said. ""No question it was the big one,"" he said. Asked if the United States would not have invaded if the administration hadn't believed Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction, Rumsfeld said: ""I think that's probably right."" He criticized the source known as ""Curveball"" -- an Iraqi defector who admitted his claims that Iraq possessed WMDs were false -- but stopped short of condemning the U.S. intelligence community. ""The intelligence community talks to hundreds of people,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They have human assets, such as this man. Some are honest, some are dishonest. Some do it for money, some do it for self aggrandizement. Some do it, apparently, to lie."" Now peddling a book, four years after being replaced by Robert Gates as defense secretary following heavy Republican losses in the 2006 mid-term elections, Rumsfeld maintained the swagger and bravado that were his hallmarks when dealing with the media as a Cabinet member. He said said the Obama administration was ""wrong in attacking the Bush administration's structures that have kept this country safe for almost a decade now,"" including the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama campaigned on the promise that he would close the facility known as Gitmo in his first year in office, but it remains open. ""They now have switched from the campaign mode, and they are keeping Guantanamo Bay. They are keeping indefinite detention,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They are keeping military commissions. So obviously, they've come to the conclusion that their campaign promises -- easier to campaign than it is to govern."" Rumsfeld also rejected the premise that the United States is viewed more favorably around the world with Obama as president. ""No, and I don't think there's data that supports that,"" Rumsfeld said. ""I think he had made a practice of trying to apologize for America. I personally am proud of America."" He was also critical of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama in his first year in office in 2009. ""Well, he had not accomplished a thing when he got the Nobel Prize,"" Rumsfeld said. ""It was given to him on hope. Had to have been, because there wasn't anything that he'd done."" Despite receiving some boos when he recently was honored at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists, Rumsfeld said the Tea Party movement has brought ""a lot of energy into public life and public affairs."" He said he was ""deeply worried about the budget"" and that the country needs to start saving money now. Some of those savings can come in the Pentagon budget he formerly oversaw, he said. ""My goodness, every year the Congress was stuffing $10 billion down the Pentagon's throat that we didn't want,"" Rumsfeld said. ""There's no question that there's money there.""",3,Politics
"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama steps in front of cameras Wednesday, he'll be addressing a nation that's simultaneously war-weary and ready for more military action against ISIS; critical of Obama's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out. Those currents of public opinion, however convoluted, will shape how Obama frames his strategy for ""degrading and ultimately defeating"" the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, which Americans now believe pose a real threat and must be combated. Here's what the polling suggests Americans are listening for when Obama speaks Wednesday: . What's your plan? When Obama admitted to reporters his administration lacked a strategy for combating ISIS in Syria, Americans largely agreed with him. More than two-thirds said in CNN's most recent survey the President lacked a clear plan for dealing with the militant jihadists. Countering that perception will be Obama's main challenge on Wednesday, and aides say he'll point to both the ongoing U.S. effort in Iraq and new efforts to train and equip local forces as evidence of a clear plot to go after the terrorists. He's open to airstrikes in Syria, officials say, and wants a broad coalition of allied countries to back him up. That puts him in agreement with the nearly three quarters of Americans who say they're ready for a broader air campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Certain specifics of the Obama plan, however, may be hard to come by -- on Tuesday, the White House said Obama would offer neither a timeline for his strategy in defeating ISIS nor a price tag. ""I wouldn't expect something that's quite that detailed,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""But the President is very interested in communicating clearly with the American public about what our priorities are and what our plans include."" Analysts say whatever strategy Obama announces -- be it airstrikes, broader training, or both -- must have a clearly articulated goal. ""The biggest mistake would be not presenting a strategy that's decisive,"" said retired CENTCOM commander Anthony Zinni. ""I think he has to clearly lay out what the objectives are. If it's the destruction of ISIS, that has significant meaning."" Obama: U.S. to ""start going on some offense"" Is ISIS a threat in the United States? Americans are worried about ISIS -- two-thirds told CNN in a poll the group posed a very or fairly serious threat. The White House agrees, saying the Islamic militants could threaten ""core American interests."" But as recently as Tuesday, the White House maintained ISIS had no current plans to attack the U.S. at home. ""There is no evidence to indicate that ISIL right now is actively plotting to hit the homeland,"" Earnest said, using the administration's name for the terror group. ""It is important for people to understand that."" So without a specific looming threat, Americans will want to hear the President's reasoning for ramping up U.S. military effort against the group -- particularly after the rhetoric used to begin the last war in Iraq turned out to be false. A majority of Americans do say they were upset by the ISIS beheadings of Americans journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and Obama has warned of Western-born foreign fighters who have the potential to return to the U.S. to stage terror plots. The timing of the speech -- on the eve of the September 11 attack anniversary -- will only serve to remind Americans of how terrorism can hit at home, even as federal officials maintain there's no current risk of attacks from ISIS. And while terrorism still ranks well below the economy as the issue most important to Americans, it is rising in standing. Just two years ago only 3% of Americans said it was their top issue; now 14% say it's what they care most about. Analysis: ISIS threat to U.S. mostly 'hype' Why not have Congress approve? When Obama was last considering airstrikes in Syria -- one year ago following President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on civilians -- he scrapped his plans when it became clear Congress wasn't on board. This time around things are different. Any action Obama announces Wednesday night won't require authorization from Congress, the White House announced, though they're still looking for support from lawmakers. The past 12 months in Syria have created a new dynamic. It's now clear al-Assad isn't leaving power, having turned over his chemical weapons to international control. The terror groups that Obama predicted would gain a foothold in Syria have. And Congress is now closer to midterm elections in which a vote for broad military power could be politically harmful. That means the President will use his existing powers to go after the jihadist group which now controls land spanning the border between Iraq and Syria. The current air campaign in Iraq relies on Obama's ability to order strikes that protect American interests and help alleviate potential humanitarian crises. Airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, an option Obama is open to, would require those parameters to be broadened -- and that will require some explaining to the American people. CNN's poll showed a large majority -- 72% of Americans -- want Congress to sign off on new military force against ISIS. But even some lawmakers themselves aren't so sure. The top Democrats in Congress -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi -- both said they agreed with the White House decision to forgo Congressional approval. Related: CNN Poll finds most Americans alarmed by ISIS . Are U.S. troops heading in? The short answer is no. Obama, having been elected to office partly on his pledge to draw down the American combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, has adamantly maintained he won't be sending American troops back into war. ""You also cannot, over the long term or even the medium term, deal with this problem by having the United States serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East. We don't have the resources. It puts enormous strains on our military. And at some point, we leave. And then things blow up again,"" he told NBC News last week. ""We've got to have a more sustainable strategy, which means the boots on the ground have to be Iraqi. ... And in Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian."" But there is an asterisk. A few hundred American troops are on the ground in Iraq to advise and help the military there. Such cooperation would be extremely difficult in Syria, where the President called long ago for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.",3,Politics
"Washington (CNN) -- How much do Republicans fear Hillary Clinton as the likely Democratic presidential nominee in 2016? So much that Karl Rove has her in his sights. The conservative political mastermind credited with orchestrating George W. Bush's two winning presidential campaigns insinuated in a fact-challenged attack last week that Clinton was brain damaged. Condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans came quickly, but Rove achieved his goal of inserting the question of Clinton's health into the national discussion before she has declared if she will run in an election more than two years away. On Wednesday, Former President Bill Clinton came to his wife's defense, joking during a public appearance that if Hillary had brain damage, ""then I must be in really tough shape because she's still quicker than I am."" ""It's just the beginning"" ""It's just the beginning,"" he said of Rove's attack, adding that Republicans ""will still get better at it."" When it comes to playing a political card, few deal better than Rove, who specializes in undermining the perceived strengths of opposing candidates. Recall the 2004 ""swift-boating"" of John Kerry, who saw one of his biggest potential advantages -- his military service in Vietnam compared to Bush's non-participation -- turned into a liability by questions about what he did there. Now Rove takes on a former U.S. senator and secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, if she decides to run. Clinton also polls strongly against all the known potential Republican contenders, a situation that likely prompted Rove to go after her. In comments at a May 8 conference reported by the New York Post's Page Six gossip column, Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and wore ""glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury"" when she returned to public life. Both assertions were false -- she spent a few days in the hospital and the glasses help deal with double vision rather than traumatic brain damage. Nevertheless, the comments generated headlines and political chatter, including repeated discussions on CNN programs. Echo chamber . Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, said Rove lied about Clinton's health but ""he doesn't care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding."" ""It's flagrant and thinly veiled,"" Merrill said, adding that Republicans ""are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer."" As for Clinton, he said ""she is 100%, period."" Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a GOP political adversary of the Clintons in the 1990s, blasted Rove's comments as typical of what he called a Republican consulting class that ""wants to be negative, narrow, personal, avoid ideas and not have to wrestle with the big issue."" Rove's tactic not only drew attention, it linked the controversy he started to the dominant Republican attack line against Clinton so far -- her management of the September 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. House Republicans have formed a select committee on Benghazi, a step intended to keep the issue in the public eye, while Democrats oppose the move and have yet to decide if they will take part. Benghazi link . Two months after the Benghazi terror attack, Clinton suffered a blood clot following a fall. She underwent testing in a hospital, then later was admitted for a three-day stay. The health issue prevented her from testifying to Congress about the attack, and some Republicans questioned the validity of her health problem at the time. Rove brought up all that history on Tuesday when he backed away from his factual errors but stressed the overall issue of Clinton's health. ""I didn't say she had brain damage. She had a serious health episode,"" Rove told Fox News before reciting a chronology of what happened in December 2012 and January 2013. ""First she had apparently a serious virus,"" he said. ""They announced then on the 15th of December that she had at some period in the past week fallen. They didn't say when, they didn't say where. She was recovering at home."" Later in December, Rove continued, ""she goes in and turns out to have had a blood clot"" but ""they won't say where."" ""The next day, they say it is between her skull and her brain behind her right ear,"" he noted. When she testified before Congress on Benghazi on January 25, Clinton wore ""special glasses that allow her to deal with the double vision that this episode caused,"" Rove added. In response, Bill Clinton ridiculed Republican efforts to politicize the entire Benghazi issue. ""First they say she faked her concussion,"" he noted Wednesday, and now they have her ""auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead."" If elected in 2016, Clinton would be 69 when she becomes president -- the same age as Ronald Reagan when he moved into the White House in January 1981. Age a campaign issue? Republican commentators repeatedly made that point Wednesday, saying Democrats defending Clinton had questioned the age of Republicans such as Reagan, Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. John McCain when they ran for higher office. GOP strategist Kevin Madden called Rove's ""erroneous"" remarks an acknowledgment of reality rather than a strategic ploy. ""I think it was a very awkward attempt at making a pretty obvious point, which is that non-candidates, which Hillary Clinton technically is, they don't get a level of scrutiny that official candidates in a 2016 race might get,"" said Madden, a CNN contributor. Shenanigans, responded Democrats. ""It's the McCarthyism of the Internet age where you can put anything out there, make a big lie, make this thing up about 30 days in the hospital, which was patently not true, make this thing up about sunglasses,"" said Richard Socarides, a former adviser to Bill Clinton. ""It was totally fabricated. Then he pulls it back. Now we're having this whole segment on it."" Tracy Sefl, a senior adviser for Ready for Hillary, one of the super PACs formed to back a Clinton candidacy, said Rove's tactic would backfire on Republicans because it boosted support for Clinton. Madden responded that vilifying Rove amounted to a Democratic counter-strategy. ""The reason that we're talking about this today has less to do with whether or not some of the facts related to Hillary Clinton's health,"" he said. ""It has to do with the fact that now while Hillary Clinton is not an official candidate, her organization and her supporters, they're acting like one. They seized on this as an opportunity to drive a contrast with someone like Karl Rove, to express some outrage and maybe engender some sympathy for Hillary Clinton.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter for her 2008 Democratic bid for the White House, a Clinton aide said Tuesday. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter, a Clinton aide said. All but $5 million of Clinton's funds can be spent trying to win the Democratic presidential nomination in the primaries, the aide said. More than 100,000 new donors contributed to the New York Democrat, the aide said. Clinton outpaced Sen. Barack Obama over the last three months, a reversal of positions from the second quarter. The Obama campaign announced Monday the Illinois Democrat raised at least $20 million for his presidential campaign during the third quarter.  All but about $1 million of Obama's contributions can be used in the primary fight. In the second quarter, he shattered fundraising records by reporting he raised $32.5 million, $31 million of which he can use in his bid for the Democratic nod. Clinton raised $27 million during this same period; all but $6 million can be used in the primaries. Fundraising is historically slow in the third quarter, which covers the final two months of summer and the first month of fall.  Watch how summer can be a tough time for candidates » . Campaign finance laws limit the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate during the primary cycle to $2,300. At the same time, individuals can contribute another $2,300 to a candidate for the general election. Campaigns often report the total of contributions for the primary and general cycles during a quarter, even though general election contributions can't be used immediately to buy ads or hire staff. ""Many in Washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be preordained and the primary process a mere formality,"" said Obama campaign chief David Plouffe in a veiled reference to Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polls. ""Yet, in this quarter alone, 93,000 more Americans joined our campaign, because they desire real change and believe Barack Obama is the one candidate who can deliver it,"" Plouffe said. ""This grass-roots movement for change will not be deterred by Washington conventional wisdom, because in many ways it is built to challenge it."" Obama's campaign said the senator has raised at least $74.9 million in primary funds so far this year from 352,000 donors. In a conference call Monday, John Edwards' campaign announced the former U.S. senator from North Carolina raised $7 million during the third quarter. Edwards, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee, said last week he would accept public financing for the primary and general election campaigns, challenging Clinton and Obama to do the same. Edwards' deputy campaign manager, Jonathan Prince, said the campaign has $12 million in cash. Prince said public funding will add $10 million to its totals. Edwards has raised more than $30 million so far, and the campaign is on the right track to reaching its goal of $40 million by January, Prince said. Crediting the campaign's aggressive grass-roots outreach, Prince said Edwards received donations from 150,000 Americans, with 97 percent of contributions less than $250. Edwards raised more than $9 million in the second quarter. On Sunday, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson reported campaign contributions of $5.2 million for the third quarter, which his campaign said supports his claim that he is a top-tier candidate. ""This figure obviously separates us from the second-tier candidates and makes clear this is a four-person race,"" Richardson's campaign said. Most political observers put Clinton, Obama and Edwards as the first-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination. Though $5.2 million is down from the $7 million reported in the second quarter, the Richardson campaign touted it as ""a strong showing in a historically difficult fundraising period."" ""Most importantly, this amount ensures we will have the resources we need to compete in the early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,"" it said. ""We have strong organizations in those states and continue to expand our field operations by adding staff and opening new offices."" The campaign did not disclose how much it had spent during the quarter or how much cash it had left. Candidates have until October 15 to file a full report with the Federal Election Commission. On the Republican side, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are expected to battle again for the top spot. Romney raised nearly $35 million so far this year, with Giuliani $1.5 million behind. Sources close to the Giuliani campaign said their candidate expects to be atop the pack for the third quarter. Among the GOP candidates, former Sen. Fred Thompson will have his numbers closely scrutinized. Thompson raised more than $8 million for his late-starting presidential campaign in the past three months, a Thompson campaign source said Monday. Thompson's upcoming FEC report also will show 70,000 donors have contributed to the Tennessee Republican in the third quarter, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the campaign has not officially released the information. The actor, a former ""Law & Order"" star, formally entered the presidential race last month, but he has been raising money since June. Thompson raised close to $3.5 million from about 9,000 donors in June, the final month of the second quarter. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is expected to show he raised more than $5 million this quarter, but a McCain adviser said recent poll numbers in New Hampshire and a busy fundraising schedule next month show the campaign has ""some life."" McCain raised $24.5 million the first two quarters of the year but spent nearly all of the funds raised. Lower numbers are expected for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, Sen. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Five security guards from Blackwater Worldwide have been indicted on charges related to a 2007 shooting in which 17 Iraqis were killed in a Baghdad square, two sources said Friday. An Iraqi woman looks at a blood-stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nusoor Square shooting. A sixth security guard is in plea negotiations, the sources told CNN. The exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury were not revealed. The sources requested anonymity because the indictment remains under court seal. It is expected to be made public by Justice Department officials as early as Monday. The Justice Department had no comment on the development, and defense attorneys for the men could not be reached for reaction. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, also had no comment. Blackwater said it wouldn't comment until there's an official announcement. Iraqi authorities accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the September 2007 shootings in Nusoor Square in western Baghdad. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents. The guards returned fire, Blackwater said. But an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon, sources told CNN. The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is the uncertain limit of a law passed by Congress that prevents prosecution of military personnel or others working for the military and leaves open the question of those working for other U.S. government departments and agencies abroad. The incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws. Security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. But starting next year, under a U.S.-Iraq security agreement that Iraq approved Thursday, Iraq will have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. The State Department renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government.",3,National News
"Washington (CNN) -- The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags.

""If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. ""The big issue Republicans are going to have to wrestle with is the Hispanic issue,"" adds Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's first press secretary. ""Republicans are going to have to find a different way forward."" The national exit polls tell the story. Latinos are the fastest growing-segment of the population. Their share of the vote expanded from 9% in 2008 to 10% in this election. The president won 67% of the vote four years ago. He increased that to 71% this year. Latinos were crucial in helping Obama win the battleground states of Colorado and Nevada, and in putting the president in the lead for Florida's 29 electoral votes. And they were just as important in turning the former swing state of New Mexico into what appears to be an increasingly safe state for the Democrats. CNN Election Center: 2012 exit polls . If the current trend continues, Arizona and Texas could turn from red to purple. The 2012 election is a loud wake-up call for the GOP to change its stance on illegal immigration. And that's being acknowledged by arguably the best known Latino Republican senator. ""The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . 2. The youth vote came up big â€” and the white vote got smaller . A big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls. More of them did than last time. According to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008. They made up 19% of the electorate this time around. That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president's drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012. It wasn't just age, but also race, that worked in the president's favor. Obama's share of the white vote dropped from 43% four years ago to 39% this year. But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74% of the electorate four years ago to 72% now. And the African-American percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13%. Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74% for Romney to win. ""The youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that's to the president's credit,"" Fleischer said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . 3. The auto bailouts helped drive Obama to victory in Ohio . For months, the Obama campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler, and they were given prominent prime-time placement during the Democratic National Convention in early September. It's a strategy that the Obama campaign thought could be the difference in Ohio, a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election. ""The American auto industry is back on top,"" Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State. The bailouts were started under President George W. Bush in 2008 but Obama grabbed the keys to the program the next year, managing and funding the assistance. Romney opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. The Obama campaign and other Democrats have attacked Romney over his opposition to the federal intervention, which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies. And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China. Portman stands by Romney auto ads . It seemed to work. Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters. Economy tops voter concerns in exit polls . 4. Romney wasn't able to expand the map . Much was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney's return to the Keystone State on Election Day. The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. To a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month. There was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map. It didn't pan out. While Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it wasn't enough. And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again. Romney's 'all' proved not enough . 5. What will $6 billion get you? We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election. And we'll have a Democrat in the White House, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election. When all the bills are in, total spending for the 2012 election (all federal and state races) could top a record-breaking $6 billion. And what did all that money buy? 2012 election priciest to date: $4.2 billion tab and rising . Some would argue ... nothing.",3,Politics
"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly one of every 10 state prisoners is sexually victimized during confinement, according to a Justice Department study released Thursday. The Bureau of Justice Statistics examined data collected in surveys of former prisoners about their time behind bars. The officials found that most of the victims had been abused while they were in state prisons, but a small percentage were molested in local jails or halfway houses. The victimization rate of 9.6% is more than double the rate cited in a report on the subject in 2008. However, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justice Department, cautioned that the previous study was based on a survey of current inmates in both state and federal institutions. The nature of the sexual incidents did not change. Female prisoners were more than three times as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as male prisoners. Prison staff sexual misconduct was prevalent. The study noted nearly seven in eight such incidents involved perpetrators of the opposite sex. More than 75% of the former prisoners who reported staff sexual misconduct were male inmates who said they had interaction with female staff, the report said. Violence associated with the sexual incidents was found to be common. ""Among all victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence, a quarter said they had been physically held down or restrained, and a quarter had been physically harmed or injured,"" the report said. About 29% of the victims reported bruises, black eyes, sprains, cuts and scratches, but 23% reported more serious injuries, including stab wounds, internal injuries, and broken bones. In response, the Justice Department announced it is establishing rules ""to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse in confinement facilities"" The steps include screening inmates for risk of being sexually abused or sexually abusive, and training prison employees. ""The standards we establish today reflect the fact that sexual assault crimes committed within our correctional facilities can have devastating consequences for individual victims and for communities far beyond our jails and prisons,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement.",3,National News
"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Angelina Jolie was on a stage Thursday but wasn't performing. Instead, she paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people across the globe made homeless by war. Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties. A U.N. goodwill ambassador, Jolie was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The poignant ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations refugee agency. Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they'd seen in refugee camps. ""I believe we must persuade the world that refugees must not be simply viewed as a burden,"" she said. ""They are the survivors. And they can bring those qualities to the service of their communities and the countries that shelter them."" Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan. She met a boy about 15 years old in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since a shot in the back paralyzed him. His family was killed, leaving him as an orphan. Yet when he spoke with her, he did it with a smile. ""He had this really remarkable, unbreakable spirit,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the event at the National Geographic Museum. ""I think of him and I can't complain about anything ... he was grateful and he had nothing and suffered everything."" The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said. According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers. Afghans and Iraqis constituted almost half of all refugees worldwide. One out of four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, agency officials found. Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee. She lived in a small, roofless dirt house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with the others because she was too far along in her pregnancy. Pakistan struggles with the largest refugee population in the world, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced citizens, largely because of the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban since April. Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N.'s refugee agency, elaborated on the plight of displaced people at the event. He said internally displaced people ""face the same plight [as refugees]. They have lost the same as refugees. They don't have the same international protections granted to refugees."" Conflicts like those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, though the number of displaced people declined by about 700,000 in 2008, the report said. Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia last year brought total displacement in each to 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. More than 2 million internally displaced people were in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the report. When a genocide targeting Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 later spilled over into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi, was caught in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal. Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into a death camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said through tears. While at the prison, she learned that she was pregnant. She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor, Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her captors' surprise, she named her newborns after them. Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal. Mapendo, named a CNN Hero in October, created Mapendo International, a nonprofit dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the U.N. agency. ""I want to encourage the refugees don't give up,"" she said. Giving up ""is not an option.""

"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated eight individuals and one entity in response to Russia’s continued aggression toward Ukraine and attempted occupation of Crimea.  Seven of these individuals were also designated yesterday by the European Union (EU).  In addition to the United States, Canada designated these same individuals today as part of a coordinated action in a strong demonstration of the international community’s continued condemnation of Russia’s interference in Crimean politics.  Additionally, OFAC designated one individual and one entity providing rail services in support of Russia’s efforts to deepen the economic integration of Russia and Crimea.  Today’s action demonstrates Treasury’s unwavering commitment to continue holding Russia accountable for its destabilizing activity in Ukraine.

“Treasury’s action, taken in close coordination with our international allies and partners, reiterates our unwavering support for restoring free and fair democratic political processes in Crimea,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The coordinated U.S., EU, and Canadian designations limit the ability of these illegitimate officials to do business internationally and highlights the strength of the transatlantic alliance in standing up to Russia’s continued aggression.”

DESIGNATION FOR OPERATING IN THE CRIMEA REGION OF UKRAINE (E.O. 13685)

Today’s action also targets an entity operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine and its chief executive officer (CEO) for being the leader of an entity operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine and for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, that entity.

Grand Service Express is a Moscow-based private railway company that began offering passenger rail service between the Russian mainland and the Crimean Peninsula over the Kerch Strait Bridge in late December 2019.

Alexander Ganov is the CEO of Grand Service Express.  Ganov became the CEO on August 28, 2019.

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these individuals and entity that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC.  OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or dealings within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.  Additionally, any entities owned 50 percent or more in the aggregate by designated persons are also blocked by operation of law.",3,International News
"(CNN) -- Tuesday was a tragic day for girls everywhere. In Pakistan, 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai was shot by the Taliban on her way home from school on a bus. Although she was targeted specifically because she spoke out against the Taliban's suppression of women's education rights, her story serves as a reminder of the obstacles that girls face in trying to obtain schooling. In all my travels, from Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to villages and towns across rural India, I have been struck by the unwavering commitment of every girl to do one simple thing: Go to school. Just like Malala, the girls I met know that education is their ticket to a better future: for themselves, their families and their entire communities. Girls would beg their parents to let them stay one more year in school, struggling to juggle their household chores with caring for their younger siblings, all so they can squeeze in one more day in the classroom. Unfortunately, girls around the world have also shared with me how pursuing an education can be dangerous, whether it's because of harassment and violence from teachers or the dangers they encounter as they walk to school. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . Today, as we celebrate the first United Nations International Day of the Girl by marking the progress that has been made for girls, we should keep in mind that we need to redouble our effort to create a future in which all girls can safely receive an education and reach their full potential. Violence keeps girls out of school. Globally, nearly half of all sexual assaults are committed against girls who are 15 and younger. Fear of this type of violence restricts where girls are allowed to go and when they are allowed to be out of the home. Often, parents do not send their daughters to school for this reason. Violence in the home can also hold girls captive and out of school. For instance, nearly half the girls in developing countries are married during their teenage years, with many before age 15. They may experience profound violence at the hands of their often much older husbands. But sadly, school does not equal safety. Even girls who are able to go to school still face violence -- in the classroom, of all places. A girl may walk up to five kilometers between home and school in the company of friends or an older brother to avoid the inevitable harassment by groups of men or boys she passes, only to receive more harassment from a teacher once she finally reaches school. In schools around the world, teachers pressure girls for sex in exchange for grades. In Zambia, for example, more than 2,000 cases of teacher rapes were reported in 2010 alone. Of these cases, only 240 teachers were convicted. While these numbers may be shocking, Zambia is not the only country with this problem. Schools should be a safe haven for girls, but instead, they are too often a place of fear and danger. International day of the girl: World's most remarkable women share advice . However, despite the violence that can happen in schools, going to school tends to increase girls' safety outside school. A recent study in Swaziland found that the risk of childhood sexual violence was greatest among those who were not attending school, suggesting that greater educational opportunities decrease vulnerability to violence. Girls in school have an opportunity to escape early marriage and early motherhood, and to gain skills that give them enhanced economic and social opportunities. As part of the global community, we can all do our part to help girls by making school safe and making sure they can get to school. Here are a few ways: . -- Invest directly in girls. Less than 2% of every international development dollar goes directly to adolescent girls, let alone toward protecting them from violence. We have made great strides globally in increasing the numbers of girls in primary school, but until we make girls' safety a priority we will not advance our educational goals. -- Ensure schools are accountable to girls by enacting and enforcing policies that prevent sexual abuse and exploitation by teachers. When a 13-year-old girl in Zambia was repeatedly raped by her teacher, the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund supported the girl's court case against the teacher who raped her and the headmaster who knowingly allowed the assaults to occur. In 2008, the High Court of Zambia ruled that the Zambian government is responsible for protecting girls from sexual assault and providing recourse to victims. Schools everywhere must enact systems that protect girls and hold teachers accountable. -- Empower schools and girls through provision of safe spaces. One important outcome of the Zambian teacher rape case has been the wide scale adoption of safe spaces for girls in Zambian schools. -- Recruit, train and retain female teachers. Female teachers can reduce some of the major risks adolescent girls face in school. They can also serve as strong role models and help girls imagine different futures for themselves. The 10x10 Campaign is uniting people and organizations around the critical goal of removing barriers to girls' education. Likewise, so is the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund. You can join them. The benefits of education for girls are undeniable. But until we can ensure that schools are places of learning, rather than places of danger, girls will be held back. When girls are educatedâ€”and safeâ€”they, along with our entire societies, will flourish. On CNN iReport, tet us know why educating girls is #basicmath .

"Washington D.C., Jan. 21, 2022 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced three awards totaling more than $40 million to four whistleblowers who provided information and assistance in three separate covered actions.

In the first order, the SEC issued an award of approximately $37 million to two joint whistleblowers who provided key evidence that contributed to the success of the covered action.   The whistleblowers also provided ongoing assistance and helped the staff identify additional information that advanced the investigation. 

In the second order, the SEC issued approximately $1.8 million to a whistleblower who provided important, new information that prompted Commission staff to open an investigation into the misconduct. The whistleblower continued to assist the staff by providing interviews and additional documents.

In the third order, the SEC awarded approximately $1.5 million to a whistleblower who provided new information that shaped staff’s investigative strategy and significantly contributed to the success of the covered action.  The whistleblower also provided substantial and ongoing assistance by helping the Commission staff identify issues.

""Credible tips of securities laws violations are a valuable component of the Commission’s enforcement program,"" said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower. ""The critical information provided by these whistleblowers aided the Commission’s investigations and helped the Commission bring these successful enforcement actions.""

The SEC has awarded approximately $1.2 billion to 245 individuals since issuing its first award in 2012. All payments are made out of an investor protection fund established by Congress that is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators.  No money has been taken or withheld from harmed investors to pay whistleblower awards.  Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.  Whistleblower awards can range from 10 percent to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.

As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower’s identity.",4,Business
"(CNN) -- Latino voters went into the midterm election Tuesday feeling like bystanders in an American political process that is broken. An election eve poll of 5,000 Latinos who said they already had voted, or intended to vote, Tuesday was particularly telling -- more than half reported that no one had contacted them to ask for their vote. That's right, no one -- not a political campaign, not a candidate, not a community organization. Perhaps partly as a result, their motivation for voting was deeply personal, with more than a third saying they were voting to show their support for the Latino community rather than for a Democratic or Republican candidate. Such views are consistent with the research we have conducted at the NALEO Educational Fund over the past four years, among ""The Great Unengaged"" -- Latino U.S. citizens who are unlikely to vote because they believe the political system does not work for them and their families, and that political promises are made and easily broken. When they are engaged and asked to vote, they do so not for themselves, but for their families and community. This lack of engagement with the two parties did not stop NALEO Educational Fund projecting that 7.8 million Latinos would vote in this election, up from the 6.6 million who voted in 2010. And although it is too early to know if we hit that mark, we do know this much -- Latino voters are as angry about Washington paralysis as other Americans. (The lack of movement on immigration reform, an issue that for the second consecutive national election ranked as the No. 1 issue for Latino voters, was simply Exhibit A in a list of reasons why the community is frustrated). Yet the failure of lawmakers to address the key issues of interest for Latino voters is particularly perplexing when we look at what happens when politicians do take these voters into account. Colorado, one of the few states with both a large Latino electorate and a competitive Senate race, underscored how it is possible for candidates to reinvent themselves and win an election by softening their approach and addressing the issues of key importance to the Latino community. Cory Gardner, who had opposed immigration reform, was able to transform himself as a candidate by addressing the issues and focusing on compromise. Perhaps this helps explain why incumbent Mark Udall, who largely ignored the issue of immigration in hopes of not alienating non-Latinos, lost -- despite 71% of Latino voters polled in Colorado having said they would vote for him. Many likely felt disinclined to vote for Udall, reflecting the reality that Latino voters are not monolithic, and their vote is up for grabs if parties and candidates speak to their issues. Looking ahead to 2016, the campaign for the White House begins today, and a presidential election has a completely different dynamic than a mid-term election. As each of the past four presidential elections has demonstrated, the road to the White House goes through the Latino community, and amassing the required Electoral College votes requires victory in states where Latino voters make the difference. This was true in George W. Bush's successful elections in 2000 and 2004, just as it was for Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What happens next in Washington on immigration reform, and the other top issues for Latino voters -- jobs and the economy, education and health care -- will set the stage for the next election. With this in mind, the next would-be president must not only reach out and directly connect with Latino voters on the issues that most matter to them, but also show that he, or she, is from a party that is able to deliver action as well.",4,Politics
"(CNN) -- The Arab League's decision to impose sweeping sanctions on Syria, a move followed by Turkey, reflects an unprecedented level of collective action by the historically moribund regional body. The Sunday vote by 19 Arab states to punish Syria further isolates Damascus and undermines President Bashar al-Assad's self-proclaimed role as the dominant voice of Arab nationalism. Indeed, the activist role adopted by the Arab League as the 2011 Arab uprisings unfold has been a surprising development: Following decades of issuing lowest common denominator communiques, the league is rapidly emerging as a key regional actor. The Arab League's strong condemnation last spring of Moammar Gadhafi's brutality easily could have been dismissed as a one-off, given the Libyan strongman's success at enraging most Arab leaders over the years. Yet by following up its suspension of Syria from the organization with tough sanctions, it's clear the Arab League is taking on a more muscular role in the unfolding regional drama. There are four main reasons for this new Arab League approach: . First and foremost: The Arab uprisings themselves. If nothing else, the protests of 2011 brought the power of Arab public opinion front and center. Gone are the days when Arab leaders could act with total disregard for their people's opinions. Public opinion throughout the Arab world resoundingly disapproved of Gadhafi's behavior, and now of Assad's. This sentiment is motivating Arab leaders to respond to their people's anger, through the Arab League. The corollary to this is Arab leaders' fear that if they stand idly by while Assad slaughters Syrians, popular resentment could boomerang against them. Whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward Israel and the West, collective Arab opprobrium is now targeted at brutal Arab regimes. If they fail to act, many Arab leaders could suffer political heartache and more popular unrest at home. Getting ahead of this demonstrates that they respond to public opinion, and it helps deflect popular discontent away from domestic issues. On the geo-strategic level, Arab League activism is motivated by a desire to keep the Arabs in the drivers' seat. With the United States largely over the horizon, Arab docility only creates windows of opportunity for non-Arabs to muck about in Middle East diplomacy. Turkey has not succeeded in creating a leading diplomatic role for itself in the region, despite efforts to play an active role in Libya, Yemen and other hot spots. The Arabs want to ensure that this remains the case. Hence, Ankara was relegated to supporting the measures adopted by the Arab League, not initiating them. The other geo-strategic explanation for Arab League activism is Iran. The Arabs, particularly the Gulf states, have long decried Iran's encroachment in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Isolating Iran's key strategic ally in the region -- Assad's Syria -- provides a significant opportunity to roll back some of Tehran's regional gains. Already, Hamas' Damascus-based leadership is looking for a new home and behaving with greater restraint. And when Iran was seen to be meddling in Bahrain's sectarian struggle earlier this year, the Gulf states brutally crushed it -- collectively. With the United States withdrawing from an Iraq they see as now heavily influenced by Iran, the other Arab states have even greater incentive to band together. In taking strong actions, the Arab League claims to want to stave off foreign intervention in Syria. Qatar's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim hinted at this when he said that he ""hoped"" the Arab League's sanctions would obviate the need for foreign intervention. In the short term, a more active Arab role may indeed make non-Arab nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in Libya, the Arab League might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention. This Arab League activism may signal a new regional norm analogous to the United Nations' ""responsibility to protect."" The Arab League has effectively joined the international rejection of the three-century old Westphalian system that enshrined the nonintervention of one state in the domestic affairs of another state. Arab leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow Arab rulers. This is a welcome development, one that could head off other foreign interventions in the Middle East and encourage further collective action against brutal acts some Arab leaders perpetrate against their own people.

"(CNN) -- Around the world, and in developing nations especially, there is an overwhelming demand for higher education. Despite worldwide increases in tertiary enrolment numbers, there still remains disparity between those with access to quality education and those without. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, only 6% of college-age students are enrolled in higher education. John Defterios: The world's next economic powers don't need the West . That number rises to 72% in North America and Western Europe, but hovers around 20% to 40% for most developing regions, according to UNESCO reports. Without higher education, most people face a grim future. But once you consider the possibilities provided by an internet connection and the growing availability of quality online education resources, the conversation about accessibility shifts from ""where"" to ""how,"" and exciting new opportunities (and challenges) arise. So how do we actualize the idea of education for everyone? Read more: Does Brazil deserve its 'B' for BRIC? At Coursera, only one-third of our students are from the U.S., and 40% are from the developing world. Not surprisingly, three of our biggest countries outside the U.S. are Brazil, India, and Russia, where the number of jobs that require a higher education greatly exceeds the number of people with education sufficient to do these jobs. In Russia, for example, new student enrollments rose 230% since January 2013 (surpassing new student growth from the U.S., which is up 178%). Our large international growth poses challenges in dealing with cultural and language differences. The challenges . Despite our global reach, most of the course material and lectures found on our platform are in English, making the courses inaccessible to many students whose native language is not English. To address this issue, we are taking a two pronged approach. First, we are working with our partner universities in non-English-speaking countries to offer courses taught natively in languages other than English (currently French, Spanish, Chinese, German, and Italian). More from Koller: Top college courses, for free? We are also building up a network of ""translation partners"" - non-profits, companies, and universities - to translate Coursera lectures from popular courses into a selection of languages common among our students. Reducing language barriers opens up new possibilities and applications of online education. Experiments in global learning . Moscow-based Digital October (one of our translation partners) has experimented with creative ways to use online education to transcend cultural and language barriers. The center for new technology and entrepreneurship recently hosted a multi-national ""ideahack."" This interactive meet-up centered around the University of Pennsylvania's online Gamification course, and attracted more than 200 live students from Moscow and 15 students from three continents around the world via video conference, with the event being simultaneously translated for Russian and English audiences. Fareed Zakaria: How to beat inequality . Those attending worked in small groups applying principles learnt from Professor Kevin Werbach's Coursera course. Professor Werbach participated virtually throughout the event. Princeton's Professor Mitch Duneier taught his sociology class to a global audience. He says that: ""Within three weeks I had received more feedback on my sociological ideas than I had in a career of teaching, which significantly influenced each of my subsequent lectures and seminars."" These insights have reshaped the way he teaches his Princeton students on campus. One student wrote to him, saying, ""It has been an incredible experience for me, one that has not only taught me sociology, but the ways in which other cultures think, feel, and respond."" Bill Gates: I just don't see room for education cuts . By their very nature, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) foster an open environment where people from all walks of life can contribute to a thriving collaborative community. Translation of online courses further helps increase access to people from diverse backgrounds, and thereby enables the true globalization of education. Other models for online education are also being explored, such as the flipped classroom, which makes high-quality course content available in conjunction with local instruction. This can provide much needed expansion of education in the many countries that lack qualified instructors. The future . With the rise of online education, the notion of a ""global classroom"" is being discussed by educators and the media alike. To me, achieving a ""global classroom"" means using education to erase barriers between people of different cultures and backgrounds; it means giving people the opportunity to learn without the limits imposed by physical or socio-economic circumstances; and it means giving schools and instructors around the world the ability to transcend boundaries to bring high-quality education to their students.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When you refuse to acknowledge a group of people in all their nuances and complexities, or depict them as predictable and one-dimensional, or dictate for them a code of acceptable behavior, it is a blatant sign of disrespect. It would be offensive for someone to suggest that all Italian-Americans think a certain way, all Irish-Americans behave a certain way or all African-Americans vote a certain way. So it is with 50.5 million Hispanic Americans, who come in every variety imaginable. You might know this from what you consume daily in the form of political messaging, media images and advertising campaigns from Madison Avenue. What better time to assert the right of Hispanics to be unpredictable and complicated human beings than Hispanic Heritage Month, which gives Americans the chance to learn more about, and pay respect to, the nation's largest minority. In 1968, Congress set aside one week each year to honor the contributions and culture of Hispanics. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation expanding the period to 30 days: September 15 to October 15. A generation or two ago, the challenge for Hispanics was simply to get noticed by corporations and political parties. That happened. Ten million votes cast in a presidential election, and roughly $1 trillion in buying power, is hard to ignore. Today, the new challenge is to get those same corporations and political parties to see Hispanics as they really are as opposed to how others want them to be or assume them to be. For example, in the past several weeks, I've been asked often on radio and television interviews to predict where the Hispanic vote will go in the 2012 election. My answer: Just about everywhere. Will Hispanics take a chance on the Republican presidential nominee -- especially if it is Texas Gov. Rick Perry who has a record of attracting Hispanic support to the point of being attacked by Republican rivals who mistakenly cast the immigration debate as ""us"" vs. ""them"" and put Hispanics in the ""them"" camp? Or will they double down by sticking with President Barack Obama who, while earning two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008, also heads an administration that has repeatedly lied to and manipulated Hispanics by promising immigration reform but delivering only record numbers of deportations -- more than 1 million since Obama took office? My answer: Yes. Both those things will happen. And more. This is not a monolith. The Hispanic population in the United States is made up of conservatives, liberals, middle-of-the-road moderates, Republicans, Democrats, independents and everything in-between. It's true that most Hispanics are registered Democrats, just like they have been for the past five decades dating back to the ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in 1960. But it is also true that Hispanics have -- in gubernatorial, congressional and presidential races over the years -- been willing to cross party lines and support moderate Republicans who eschew anti-Hispanic nativism and craft a message that appeals to them. You see that sort of thing much more often at the local and state level than you do in the federal arena. But it happens everywhere. The list of Republicans who enjoyed significant Hispanic support in their political careers is long and distinguished. It includes George W. Bush, John McCain, Jeb Bush, Rudolph Giuliani, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and two former Arizona governors -- Fife Symington and Jane Hull. Of course, among Hispanics, there are differences in geography, economic status and educational attainment that help shape how they see the world and their place in it. There are also ancestral differences. According to the 2010 census, about two-thirds of those 50.5 million people are Mexican or Mexican-American. The other third is made up of Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, Salvadorans, Brazilians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Colombians, Venezuelans and others. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and self-described ""son of exiles"" who is being talked about as possibly landing on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket, is the darling of South Florida. Yet, if Rubio were on the GOP ticket, he is likely to be very unpopular in the Southwest where many Mexican-Americans resent Rubio's hard line on illegal immigration. It's easy to talk tough about border security or oppose ""amnesty"" when you represent a community in which came here on the red carpet of the Cuban Adjustment Act, a relic of the Cold War that makes it almost impossible to remove Cuban immigrants once they arrive on these shores. But besides those differences, there are also similarities. Regardless of their backgrounds or biographies or biases, Hispanics want what the rest of their countrymen want: The chance to work for a brighter tomorrow, the right blend of rights and responsibilities and the respect that comes from being seen as individuals and not just part of a group. And why not? That's the American way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.",4,Opinion/Editorial
"Washington D.C., June 28, 2018 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the company’s September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers.   This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach.  In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading. 

In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta today, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.

According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach.  The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options.  Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.

Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.

“As we allege, Bonthu, who was entrusted with confidential information by his employer, misused that information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach and then sought to illegally profit,” said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office.  “Corporate insiders simply cannot abuse their access to sensitive information and illegally enrich themselves.”

In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.

To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.  The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries.  The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.",4,Business
"Washington D.C., Dec. 20, 2021 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against five Russian nationals for engaging in a multi-year scheme to profit from stolen corporate earnings announcements obtained by hacking into the systems of two U.S.-based filing agent companies before the announcements were made public. The filing agents assist publicly traded companies with the preparation and filing of periodic reports with the SEC, including quarterly reports containing earnings information.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleges that defendant Ivan Yermakov used deceptive hacking techniques to access the filing agents’ systems and directly or indirectly provided not-yet-public corporate earnings announcements stolen from those systems to his co-defendants Vladislav Kliushin, Nikolai Rumiantcev, Mikhail Irzak, and Igor Sladkov. According to the complaint, from 2018 through 2020, the traders used 20 different brokerage accounts located in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Cyprus and Portugal to generate profits of at least $82 million using the stolen information to make trades before over 500 corporate earnings announcements. The defendants allegedly shared a portion of their enormous profits by funneling them through a Russian information technology company founded by Kliushin and for which Yermakov and Rumiantcev serve as directors.

“With this action, the SEC, using its powerful analytical tools, has exposed a highly sophisticated and deceptive scheme to steal and monetize non-public corporate information,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “While we remain steadfast in our commitment to protect the integrity of our securities markets against bad actors no matter where they are located or what sophisticated tactics they use, we strongly encourage companies to shore up their safeguards against, and remain vigilant for cyber breaches that compromise their non-public information.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the five defendants named in the SEC’s action and that defendant Vladislav Kliushin was extradited from Switzerland.

The SEC’s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining them from committing future violations of the antifraud laws.

"San Diego, California (CNN)Political attacks have really gone to the dogs. They used to have more style and substance. It was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth, counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst. It used to be that when you wanted to sling mud at someone whose politics you didn't agree with -- chiefly as a way of making them look bad and yourself look good by comparison -- you'd try to dig up dirt, find a skeleton in a closet or challenge the person's integrity. These days, you don't have to work that hard. The whole process is do-it-yourself. You just go to Facebook and see what embarrassing family photos can be linked to the person you intend to slime. The target doesn't even have to be in the photo. Just the fact that they posted it, or thought it was humorous, or in any way condoned the act is good enough. In our narcissistic look-at-me-and-mine culture, social media networks are veritable treasure chests of blunders, blushes and blemishes. Even with our best efforts to use these sites to showcase our best features, there is plenty of embarrassment to go around. Once you find the photos, you do a little cut and paste. Then you can scribble a few sentences about how shocked -- shocked! -- you are that people could behave in such a manner. Be sure to include a line from the head of some nonprofit that raises funds by advancing the idea that, without a group like theirs, our entire society would be in dire straits. If you're attacking someone on the left, you might hunt around on social media for a photo where they're not wearing a flag pin and accuse them of being unpatriotic. If you're trying to smear someone on the right, you can fall back on the old standby and accuse them of being uncaring. How uncaring? Enough to use a dog as a food stool. The offender in question is 6-year-old Trig Palin, who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother Sarah, one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals. This time, what put Trig in the liberal's version of ""timeout"" is a photo on his mom's Facebook page of him standing barefoot on his new pet dog -- a black labrador oddly named Jill Hadassah -- so he could reach the kitchen sink and wash his dish. The liberal organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was not amused. PETA blasted Palin in a statement, calling her ""hard-hearted"" and ""bizarrely callous."" The statement read, ""It's odd that anyone -- let alone a mother -- would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo."" You know who deserves sympathy? The journalists who got that statement and had to whip up a story based on faux outrage. Palin struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like PETA have lost influence and credibility: the double standard they employ, denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support. Where was the organization last year, she asked, when the liberal talk show hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, posted a similar photo of a girl standing on a dog? Back then, PETA was AWOL. She is right about the double standard. And I admire her spunk. In a world of politicians and even former politicians who are so careful about what they say and do that they don't say or do anything, Palin unplugged is a refreshing exception. There is more to the story. According to media reports, the canine is a service dog that was trained to care for Trig, who has Down syndrome. The little guy doesn't just need special care. It seems that he also needs constant protection -- from liberals who hate his mommy. Trig was first targeted by the left in February 2010, when he was just shy of 2 years old. That's when Seth MacFarlane, creator of the Fox animated comedy, ""Family Guy,"" thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs. In the episode, the character Chris is dating a teenage girl with Down syndrome, and when he asks her what her parents do, she says, ""My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" David Tolleson, head of the Atlanta-based National Down Syndrome Congress, called the gag ""hurtful and stereotypical.""  And Palin's daughter Bristol wrote on her mom's Facebook page that the joke was especially cruel given that her brother already faces a life filled with intolerance and prejudice. On the defensive, MacFarlane claimed at the time that he was ""an equal opportunity offender."" Sure. In 2008, the comedian had spoken at an Obama-Biden rally at a university in Ohio, where he took potshots at Republicans and touted the Democratic ticket. As all this unfolded, we learned -- thanks to Trig -- a valuable lesson about how the tolerant left has a much stronger stomach for intolerance if its aimed at one of its enemies. Now the little guy is at it again, teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air. In a perfect world, I'd prefer that children not mistake their household pets for a step ladder. But whatever else can be said about the world that Trig Palin is likely to face in the years to come, this much we know: It won't be perfect.",4,Opinion
"(CNN) -- When the comedian Daniel Tosh reportedly singled out a woman in his audience and suggested, according to a blog post that recounted the incident, it would be ""funny"" if she ""got raped by, like, five guys, right now,"" the online reaction was swift, heated and often split down gender lines. Many men wanted to explain free speech or heckling etiquette. Many women (and virtually all feminists) said these topics were distractions, at best, from the sheer offensiveness of Tosh's attack. As we at the Women's Media Center watched hundreds of users comment on our Facebook post about the incident, we saw the same disconnect. Quite a few of the women who shared our post said they were doing so in hopes that a husband or boyfriend would ""finally understand why I won't watch Tosh's show with him."" Some even tagged their husbands or boyfriends, to be sure the message would reach its destination. In the aggregate, these comments gave us a glimpse into the ongoing, low-grade conflicts between women who have been trying to articulate their discomfort with Tosh's lazy, cruel and misogynistic humor, and the men who share their lives but just don't get it. At the center of these disagreements is the rape-joke empathy gap. The problem isn't a failure of men to see rape as horrific. It's that many of them do not perceive that rape itself lies on the far end of a broad spectrum of ways in which the idea of rape, the invocation of rape or the threat of rape is used to intimidate women or to regulate their behavior. When women are told that they shouldn't drink too much or walk alone at night or wear a revealing top, they are being given a guided tour of the boundaries of acceptable female conduct. Women are supposed to understand that these boundaries are policed by rapists. We cross the line at our own risk. And if we are caught, the brutal punishment is one we have earned. Gilbert Gottfried: If you don't want to hear an edgy joke, don't listen . A comedian who shoots down an audience member who objects to his rape jokes by joking about her being gang-raped on the spot isn't being funny. He's using rape to shut up a woman who crossed a boundary by speaking out of turn. That is unacceptable. Tosh was free to say what he said, of course. But that doesn't mean it wasn't morally repugnant. It was. What about rape jokes with less vicious punch lines? Here is the gray area where the empathy gap thrives best. There is absolutely room in both comedy and in feminism for discussions about rape jokes that highlight rape as a social ill vs. those that perpetuate that injustice. That's why we joined with other feminist media critics and activists to produce a YouTube ""supercut"" of rape jokes -- some insightful and some far less so. Still, the presence of rape in women's lives is too real and pervasive for many to laugh at all the same jokes that many men can. It's not that women never enjoy crude humor -- a lesbian journalist friend recently confided in us her amazement that her wife is a fan of Tosh's show, if not some of its more brutal misogyny. And it's not that no man knows with terrible certainty what it's like to be a rape victim -- one in five females and one in 71 males in the United States are the victims of rape, to say nothing of atrocities around the world such as those described in our new report on rape as a weapon of war in Syria. Nonetheless, the significant overlap between the gender divide and the rape-joke empathy gap is real, and it seems inevitable when media coverage of rape so often focuses on what a victim should have done differently to try harder not to get raped. Such shoddy framing creates a fictional image that there's a certain type of woman who gets raped. Women know that's a lie, because they live the truth, but men may never have occasion to question that image, and so when they laugh at rape jokes, they're laughing at an abstraction that's all too real for many women. Tosh and all those with the privilege to hold a microphone have a responsibility to shine a light on the reality behind the abstraction -- not to perpetuate it, and certainly not to silence those who bear its burden.

"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FL – Federal workplace safety inspectors examining how a 26-year-old diver drowned in a golf course pond – after only three days working for a Freming Island commercial diving and recovery company – found the employer failed to follow required safety standards, including ensuring adequate supervision was in place and that required training was provided.

The December 2021 incident occurred as the dive technician and a coworker employed by Ballhawker of Florida Inc. recovered sunken golf balls in a pond on a Ponte Vedra Beach golf course. When the diver became unresponsive, the coworker pulled him from the water and asked a passing golfer to call 911. The diver was transported to a local hospital where he later died.

Following an investigation, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued citations to Ballhawker for 12 serious violations. OSHA found the company failed to:

Train divers to handle assigned tasks safely, including using equipment.
Ensure all dive team members are CPR trained.
Provide a first-aid handbook or a resuscitator at the dive location.
Provide continuous monitoring and oversee diving operations.
Inspect diving equipment and components prior to every dive.
Test air compressor systems for air purity every six months.
Use diver depth gauges.
Set up an operational communication system among all dive team members.
Comply with pre-dive requirements prior to operations.
Develop and maintain a safe practice manual for divers.
Inspectors found that Ballhawker also failed to keep records of workers and job details, including a designated person-in-charge; the date, time and location of the job; and water and surface conditions.

OSHA proposed $55,870 in penalties.

“Ballhawker ignored safety standards and a young man lost his life,” said OSHA Acting Area Office Director Erin Sanchez in Jacksonville, Florida. “Commercial divers are exposed to a variety of hazards, and it is an employer's responsibility to not start a dive until it is safe.” 

The company has 15 business days from receipt of their citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.",5,Local News

"WASHINGTON, DC – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched a webpage with coronavirus-related guidance for construction employers and workers. The guidance includes recommended actions to reduce the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.

Employers of workers engaged in construction (such as carpentry, ironworking, plumbing, electrical, heating/air conditioning/ventilation, utility construction work, and earth-moving activities) should remain alert to changing outbreak conditions, including as they relate to community spread of the virus and testing availability. In response to changing conditions, employers should implement coronavirus infection prevention measures accordingly.

The webpage includes information regarding:

Using physical barriers, such as walls, closed doors, or plastic sheeting, to separate workers from individuals experiencing signs or symptoms consistent with the coronavirus;
Keeping in-person meetings (including toolbox talks and safety meetings) as short as possible, limiting the number of workers in attendance, and using social distancing practices;
Screening calls when scheduling indoor construction work to assess potential exposures and circumstances in the work environment before worker entry;
Requesting that shared spaces in home environments where construction activities are being performed, or other construction areas in occupied buildings, have good air flow; and
Staggering work schedules, such as alternating workdays or extra shifts, to reduce the total number of employees on a job site at any given time and to ensure physical distancing.
Visit OSHA's coronavirus webpage frequently for updates. For further information about the coronavirus, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Bacardi Bottling Corp. with 12 alleged safety violations following the death of a 21-year-old temporary worker his first day on the job. Lawrence Daquan ""Day"" Davis was crushed to death by a palletizer machine at the Jacksonville facility in August 2012. The company uses Remedy Intelligent Staffing as a temporary staffing service to provide laborers for certain types of jobs.
""A worker's first day at work shouldn't be his last day on earth,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers are responsible for ensuring the safe conditions of all their employees, including those who are temporary.""
OSHA requires that employers protect the health and safety of all workers under their supervision and control. Davis was cleaning glass from under the hoist of a palletizing machine when an employee restarted the palletizer. Bacardi Bottling had failed to train temporary employees on utilizing locks and tags to prevent the accidental start-up of machines and to ensure its own employees utilized procedures to lock or tag out machines.
Two willful citations have been issued for failing to develop, document and utilize lockout/tagout procedures for the control of potentially hazardous energy and train temporary workers on lockout/tagout procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.
""We are seeing untrained workers - many of them temporary workers - killed very soon after starting a new job. This must stop,"" said Michaels. ""Employers must train all employees, including temporary workers, on the hazards specific to that workplace - before they start working. Had Bacardi done so, this tragic loss of life could have been prevented.""
Also cited are nine serious violations for exposing workers to trips, struck-by and fire hazards where fixed permanent conveyors crossed through the aisle; obstructing exit routes; exposing workers to falling bottles and debris from overhead conveyors and electrical shock hazards. The employer also failed to provide an adequate number of lockout/tagout devices to perform lockout/tagout procedures of energy sources on various equipment, conduct an adequate periodic review of the energy control procedures, perform servicing and maintenance on machines and equipment without training in the methods and means for energy isolation, and require workers to wear safety goggles and long sleeves when using air guns at 90 pounds per square inch. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.
One other-than-serious violation has been cited for storing a mixing tank within 12 inches of the electrical panel box. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.

""Removing guards and failing to train workers in proper lockout procedures is inexcusable,"" said Judy Freeman, OSHA's area director in Wichita. ""Tyson Foods failed to ensure safety procedures, demonstrating a lack of commitment to workplace safety and health and resulting in a tragic injury.""
OSHA began its inspection upon learning of the amputation, which occurred June 17 when four workers were cleaning conveyor equipment at the end of their shift. Guarding on the conveyor was removed, exposing workers to rotating parts. A worker's frock and the employee's arm were then pulled into moving gears of a conveyor that had not been locked out to prevent unintentional operation. Two willful violations involve failing to train workers on lockout/tagout procedures and to lock out equipment to prevent the unintentional operation of equipment and exposure to amputation hazards. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement, or with plain indifference to employee safety and health.
One serious violation involves fall hazards when workers ascend the upper platform work area in two separate plant locations. The company failed to provide fixed stairs to reach the work areas. An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known existed.
An other-than-serious violation involves lack of legible markings on forklift levers. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.
OSHA has proposed fines of $147,000. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/TysonFoodsInc_913161_1213_13.pdf
Due to the nature and severity of violations, the company has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. OSHA's SVEP focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations.

While the crew was filming, a CSX Corp. train traveling on the tracks was observed heading toward them. Crew members immediately started exiting the tracks, trying to remove set pieces and get off the trestle. However, they were unable to outrun the oncoming train. Ms. Jones was killed and eight other crew members were injured by debris when the train hit a hospital bed being used as a set piece.
""Their failure to develop a safety plan to prevent such hazards, including obtaining permission from the rail owner to use the tracks for filming, led to the death of one crew member and injuries to eight other employees,"" said Kurt Petermeyer, OSHA's Regional Administrator for the Southeast.
A willful citation was issued for the employer's failure to provide safety measures to protect employees from moving trains. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.
The serious citation was issued for exposing workers to fall hazards while working on a train trestle that was not equipped with safety guardrails or other fall protection measures. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, fatal work injuries in Georgia accounted for 101 of the 4,628 fatal work injuries* reported in 2012. Additional details are available at http://www.bls.gov.
Film Allman LLC was on location filming the Gregg Allman biopic. The movie production company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply; request a conference with OSHA's Savannah, Georgia, area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission. At the time of the incident, the company employed 20 workers on the set and approximately 74 workers nationwide. Proposed penalties total $74,900.",5,Local News
"(CNN) -- HTC is dipping its toes in the camera market with the new Re: a supersimple handheld action camera that pairs with a smartphone. The L-shaped Re camera looks like an inhaler or small periscope. Just under 4 inches high, the waterproof gadget is mostly handle. It turns on when you grip it and features a fixed ultra-wide-angle lens, a single button and no viewfinder. It captures 16 megapixel still images and shoots 1080p HD videos at 30 frames per second or 720p videos at 120 frames per second. Though it works independently, the Re does a lot more when used with its Android or iOS apps. The apps can turn a smartphone into a viewfinder and make it possible to shoot time-lapse and slow motion videos. Why is HTC, traditionally a smartphone company, making a camera? In a way, all smartphone makers are already in the camera industry. Starting with Apple's iPhone, smartphone manufacturers have mostly obliterated the point-and-shoot by putting powerful cameras in everyone's pocket. Part of the problem was that traditional pocket cameras just couldn't catch up fast enough with the editing and instant sharing features smartphones offered. HTC is approaching its camera from a different angle: It's built as a phone accessory. Though aimed at a more casual user, Re is similar to the many portable action cameras available. Led by the hugely popular GoPro, action cameras have taken off in recent years. Rugged and powerful, they can be mounted on vehicles, heads and animals for intense videos. Like GoPro, the Re will have a line of custom mounts and clips. It can shoot up to 1 meter underwater. HTC says the camera will be available before the end of the year and cost $199. It comes in white, navy and red. The Taiwanese company announced the new camera on Wednesday, along with the Desire Eye smartphone. Built to capitalize on the selfie craze, the Desire Eye puts its most powerful camera on the front side of the phone, so people can get the highest quality image of their face and make sure they look good at the same time.",6,Technology
"(CNN) -- The news that America now has more cell phone subscribers than people doesn't surprise documentary filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. ""There's 5 billion cell phones on the planet, but only 2 billion people online,"" said the director, whose new film ""Connected"" explores our increasing dependence on the electronic devices we carry. Shlain seems to have a love-hate relationship with technology. In the film's trailer she recounts a story of being at dinner with a friend and pretending to go the bathroom so she could check her e-mail on her smartphone. ""Everything is happening so fast. There doesn't seem to be a lot of time to really talk about what it is doing to us,"" said Shlain, who is also a founder of the Webby Awards. ""What does it mean to be connected in the 21st century? What's the good? What's the bad? What's the hope?"" Thanks to smartphones, people aren't just connecting through calls anymore. Increasingly, they're messaging on their phones through texts, e-mail, Facebook or Twitter -- streams of incoming information that are now accessible to us anytime and anywhere we have a signal. According to a trade industry report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the United States has 327 million cell phone subscribers, more than its 315 million people. Shlain believes her film presents technology as a next step in shaping society. ""These phones extend our desire for emotional connection. So these are all expanding human capacity because it's us evolving. We continue to want to have more ways to exchange ideas and connect,"" she said. But Shlain also thinks there is a darker side to our always-on, always-connected society. ""People have gotten incredibly rude. When you are with a good friend you should not have your cell phone right here like a ticking bomb. I think there should be no texting in funerals. When you walk in to greet your husband or partner, you should not be talking on a cell phone."" In the film, Shlain ponders what the lasting impact of this information explosion will be. ""I wonder if people are going to look back on this period and say, 'I cannot believe people used their cell phones so much in every situation and there were no boundaries,"" she said. In her own life, Shlain has taken action to limit her digital diet. One day a week, she and her family have a technology shutdown. ""All of the screens go off for 24 hours and it's the most delicious, long, wonderful day. I read, I write in my journal, I hang out with my kids and my husband and the day feels like four days in one. Then we all can't wait to go back online. It kind of helps you re-appreciate technology in a new way."" ""Connected"" is in limited release in the United States. To learn more, check out the film's website.",6,Technology
"San Francisco (CNN) -- Google has a simple and inexpensive new way to stream Internet videos on your TV. The company on Wednesday introduced Chromecast, a small device that lets you stream content to your television over a WI-Fi network, using your computer, phone or tablet as a remote control. The company said its goal is to create a device with zero setup time, no learning curve, and one that works with all platforms and devices. The $35 Chromecast is a radically different approach to TV than Google's previous failed attempt, the Nexus Q. It's smaller, cheaper and available starting today. The two-inch dongle looks like a thumb drive and pops into the HDMI port on an HDTV. It turns your phone, tablet or computer into a remote. Choose what content you'd like to stream and the Chromecast will play it on a nearby TV. ""The television is missing in the (streaming-video) picture. it is really, really difficult to get your online videos on the television,"" said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and apps, at Wednesday's press event. Google unveils upgraded Nexus 7 tablet . Chromecast supports both Android and iOS devices. At its event, Google demonstrated the device using a Windows laptop and an iPhone. Chromecast also is streaming directly from your Wi-Fi connection, so it's not draining your device's battery. That means you can multi-task, checking e-mail on your computer, tablet or phone while a custom YouTube playlist broadcasts on your TV. The device currently only streams content from YouTube, Google Play and Netflix, though more apps, such as Pandora, are expected in the future. A beta feature lets you stream any tab directly from a Chrome browser running on one of your non-TV devices. With Chromecast, Google is seeking a foothold in a small but growing field. Only 15% of households have figured out how to watch online video on their TV sets, according to Google. The device goes head-to-head with existing Internet-on-TV solutions like Apple TV or the Roku box. The Chromecast stick is on sale now in the Google Play store and at electronics retailers such as Best Buy, although it may not ship immediately. A purchase of Chromecast includes three months of free Netflix streaming. Opinion: Apple becoming a follower, not a leader .",6,Technology
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Under heavy criticism for a telling cell phone carriers to ban certain words in text messages, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority went into damage control mode Wednesday. PTA spokesman Mohammed Younis Wednesday denied the existence of the plan, which has met with derision from mobile phone users in the country. ""If at all we finally decide to go for this process, then we will prepare a list in consultation with the mobile operators,"" Younis told CNN. In another conversation with CNN two days earlier, however, Younis acknowledged that the telecommunications authority had sent out a notice to carriers -- but said that the agency was giving the operators more time to come up with a shorter list. Earlier this week, three carriers -- Mobilink, Warid and Telenor -- received the notice, officials there confirmed. In it, the PTA , which regulates cell phone and internet carriers in Pakistan, called on them to implement the ban within seven days. This would mean blocking text messages containing the offending words. Most of the 1,500 banned words were deemed sexually explicit or obscene by the PTA, the officials said. The words include ""taxi"" -- often used to refer to prostitutes in Pakistan -- ""gay,"" ""tongue,"" ""homosexual,"" ""intercourse,"" ""condom"" and ""hole."" CNN has obtained a copy of the list. In the notice, which is available online, the PTA cited a law that bans the transmission of indecent and obscene messages. The notice says the banned words are part of an effort to cut down on spam and unsolicited text messages, the officials said. Last month, the PTA banned thousands of websites containing pornography. But the latest about face on text messages appears to mean the PTA will not act on the notice -- at least, any time soon.",6,National News
"(CNN) -- ""App"" has been a computing term for a lot longer than five years. But, on July 10, 2008, it began its journey to becoming a household word. That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world. The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads. But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones. 'Angry Birds' Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have ""Angry Birds"" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire. Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush' Google Maps . With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?) Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions. Witness the mini-disaster Apple had on its hands when it bumped Google's offering for its own Maps app last year. Apple's product was so half-baked that CEO Tim Cook, in a rare mea culpa, essentially told users to download Google Maps until it was fixed. How to kickstart your holiday using apps not maps . Pandora . By 2008 Pandora already had become a popular Web-streaming service, letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked. But the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing, and Pandora was among the first apps available when the App Store went live. Since then, it's become the second-most downloaded iPhone app in the store's history, trailing only Facebook. Its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors, from Spotify to Rdio to Last.fm. Why everybody's building a Web music service . Instagram . Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, made all of us photographers. That's a huge shift. But, sadly for most of us, it didn't make us all good photographers. Enter Instagram -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good. Add to that Instagram's social features, complete with Twitter-like hashtags, and you've got a tool tailor-made for mobile. Launched in 2010 by Stanford University students, Instagram now moves about 45 million images every day. Oh ... and those creators also sold it to Facebook last year for a cool $1 billion. Instagram launches 15-second video feature . Shazam . It seems like a little thing, until you stop and think about it: What if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song, then tell you what it is? That would have sounded like magic not so many years ago. Now, we take it for granted. Shazam started in the UK in 2002 as a Web service. But it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution, and is now among Apple's Top 10 downloaded apps, with 350 million users. 20 fun and useful new mobile apps .",6,Technology
"(CNN) -- A couple years ago, a Microsoft researcher named Gordon Bell embarked on a personal experiment: He would wear a video camera around his neck all the time and keep this ""life recorder"" always turned on, so it would record everything he did. It was like an external memory drive for his brain, he wrote in a book called ""Total Recall."" Sounds pretty sci-fi, right? Not so much. The ""real-time sharing"" updates Facebook announced Thursday aim to do something quite similar -- only for the Internet instead of in real life. Before we get into the details and implications, here's a ""real-time"" example of how the updates, which are rolling out in the coming weeks, will work: As I write this, I'm listening to the band LCD Soundsystem on an Internet music service called Spotify. Because I've updated my Facebook page (here's a TechCrunch article on how to do that if you're interested) and because I've logged in to Spotify with my Facebook identity, every song I listen to is automatically shared to Facebook. Suddenly, my listening experience isn't private. It's public. All my Facebook friends are watching. And judging. Chances are this will affect people's behavior online. If you're a closet fan of Lady Gaga or Bjork or Enya (I'm all three), then you'll just have to stop listening to those potentially mockable artists -- either that, or all your Facebook friends will be chiming in with comments: . ""OMG, you're listening to that?!"" In the old world of Facebook, I would have to click that I ""liked"" a song for it to show up on my Facebook profile page. That's something you have to think about: ""OK, I really like this song, and I really want all of my friends to know that I'm listening to it right now."" Now, sharing is both passive and automatic. It's a choice you make in advance -- one time -- and never again. And so it goes with all kinds of the new ""real-time"" apps. Since I've logged in to Yahoo! News with Facebook, every time I read an article on that site, it goes to my Timeline. The same is true for Hulu and TV shows. And for the Internet game ""Words with Friends."" When I play a Scrabble-style word in that game, it will show up on Facebook, along with an image of the current playing board. For Facebook, this is obviously a good thing. The site's goal -- as postulated in ""Zuckerberg's Law"" -- always has been to get people to share more and more information about themselves. That's bound to happen in this new auto-share era. It's also ostensibly good for makers of Facebook apps. In a presentation in San Francisco on Thursday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said he was initially skeptical of the deal, since it would give Facebook so much information about Netflix's customers' preferences for movies and TV shows. He decided it was smart, however, after he used the real-time app integration for himself and decided it was so addictive that it would doubtlessly result in more people watching more videos on Netflix -- a good thing for him, of course. But the benefits for Facebook users are less clear. Tech bloggers and analysts worry these automatic, real-time updates will kick off a new level of oversharing. If you were sick of hearing about what your aunt had for breakfast and who your co-workers had ""friended"" on Facebook, wait until you know every single song they've listened to and every single movie they've watched. ""It's not hard to imagine Facebook sharing more than doubling after the f8 launches,"" Liz Gannes wrote at the blog AllThingsD. ""Millions of tiny little actions are going to move from implicit to explicit. You can start to see why Facebook enabled its 'ticker' news feed earlier this week (that's the dizzying real-time stream that many users have been complaining about). There's going to be a ton of information flying by."" With every one of these ""passive"" shares, users are teaching Facebook a little more about themselves. That's incredibly valuable to advertisers, who can use that data for target marketing. It's also a potential invasion of privacy, Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology writes at The Daily Beast. ""Since a one-time click will grant a persistent permission to any app to collect and disclose personal information on your behalf, Facebook will have to make sure its users fully understand the implications of these new apps before roll-out, or risk another round of privacy backlash,"" he says. Brookman sides with Facebook on the changes, though. ""For Facebook, of course, the point is for you to provide them more data about your life, which they can use to serve you ads you'll be more likely to engage with (which makes them more money). But there's potentially real value here too, if people can discover ways to share their music-listening and cooking habits with friends in a perhaps lighter-touch way."" Passive sharing isn't a privacy invasion, but it is ""killing taste,"" Farhad Manjoo wrote at Slate. ""Why do you share a story, video, or photo? Because you want your friends to see it. And why do you want your friends to see it? Because you think they'll get a kick out of it,"" he says. ""I know this sounds obvious, but it's somehow eluded Zuckerberg that sharing is fundamentally about choosing. You experience a huge number of things every day, but you choose to tell your friends about only a fraction of them, because most of what you do isn't worth mentioning."" The MIT Technology Review notes that Facebook tried something like this in 2007. It failed. ""The new features may prove controversial,"" Tom Simonite says. ""In some ways they resemble Beacon, a failed project from 2007 in which sites like Amazon automatically posted updates to Facebook when a person bought something. Beacon was canceled after public protests over a lack of privacy controls."" We'll see how the public reacts to what Zuckerberg calls ""real-time serendipity"" when these changes launch in a few weeks. But if these changes stand, and if people do sign up for these new-new Facebook apps with auto-share built in, then all of us may soon have a semi-public record of everything we do online.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Personal details and photographs of the incoming head of Britain's international spy agency have been posted on Facebook, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband acknowledged Sunday. The UK's Foreiogn Office says foreign service staff should exercise caution on social-networking Web sites. But he insisted that no compromising information had been revealed. ""You know he wears Speedo, swim, swimming, swimsuit... I mean what is that? I mean, that's not a state secret,"" Miliband said on a BBC Sunday morning talk show. The man in question, John Sawers, is currently the British ambassador to the United Nations. His wife posted details about their family, vacations and residence on the social-networking site, British media reported Sunday. Her Web site has since been taken down, reports said. Have you ever posted something you later regretted on a social-networking Web site? Sawers ""was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6,"" said Miliband, using the common term for the Secret Intelligence Service. ""He is an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organization that does a huge amount for this country,"" Miliband added. ""The fact that there is a picture, the head of MI6 goes swimming. I mean, wow! That really is exciting. It is not a state secret."" But intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear-Harvey said the leak was at least an embarrassment and possibly much worse. ""Have you ever seen the foreign secretary more embarrassed?"" he asked rhetorically. ""The Foreign Office should have made the announcement that no personal details should have been left on any computer or directory,"" Trenear-Harvey told CNN. The leak compromises Sawers' personal security, said Trenear-Harvey, the editor-in-chief of ""The World Intelligence Review."" ""You could have someone come online and insinuate themselves with Lady Sawers' daughter,"" who reportedly appeared on the Facebook Web site. If she shares a computer with her father at home, ""the house could pick up a virus, and once that happens we have access to the next chief of the Secret Intelligence Service,"" the analyst said. An additional reason for red faces is that Sawers will be in charge of a new British cybersecurity organization when he becomes head of MI6, Trenear-Harvey pointed out. The new organization, based at GCHQ, another British intelligence agency, will be ""charged with making sure that all the intelligence services are not vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, or phishing,"" Trenear-Harvey said. This is not the first time a top British intelligence official's personal details have been leaked. When Richard Dearlove became the head of MI6 in 1999, ""his address in Putney was announced,"" forcing the government to put Special Branch police officers there to protect him, Trenear-Harvey said. And when Stella Rimington became the first publicly named head of MI5, the domestic security agency, in 1991, her north London address was revealed. ""She and her daughter fled the house and were put into an MI5 safe house,"" Trenear-Harvey said. Foreign service officers ""are advised to exercise caution"" on social-networking Web sites, a Foreign Office representative said, declining to be named, in line with government policy. Sawers, 53, is a career foreign policy expert. He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair when Blair was prime minister, then became ambassador to Egypt and briefly represented Britain in Iraq. He was political director at the Foreign Office for four years before going to the United Nations in 2007, according to his biography on the Web site of the British mission to the U.N. He is slated to replace John Scarlett in November as head of MI6. As chief of SIS, he reports to the foreign secretary, according to the SIS Web site. ""Known as the Chief of SIS or 'C' (after the first Chief, Mansfield Smith Cumming, who signed himself 'C'), the Chief is the only serving member of the Service who is officially named in public,"" according to the agency.

"London (CNN) -- Microsoft's popular Kinect for Xbox 360 has inspired countless ingenious ""hacks"" since its launch at the end of 2010. The motion-sensing device has been modified to produce everything from real-time light sabers to nifty trash bins which catch your garbage (however bad your aim), proving a catalyst for creativity and invention. Today, Kinect's reach extends far beyond its gaming origins, spurring advances in medical treatment. Researchers at the UK's University of Southampton, for example, are using the technology to help patients recovering from a stroke. A specially devised algorithm enables therapists to remotely track patients' hand and finger movements and guide them through exercises which compliment a wider program of physiotherapy. ""It widens our opportunities to make rehabilitation more accessible to people in their homes,"" says Cheryl Metcalf, lecturer in Biomechanics at Southampton. ""(Patients) can just plug it into their TV and be monitored over the internet,"" she said. ""The whole tele-medicine idea opens up so many different avenues to be able to look and measure progress objectively."" Aided by electrical engineering company Roke Manor Research, Metcalf and colleagues have created a prototype which is currently being assessed against the traditional laboratory-based system. It's an accessible technology which people are more willing to accept, says Metcalf, and Microsoft have been very supportive. ""We're very grateful to them for releasing the (Kinect for Windows) SDK (software development kit) and making it more accessible to people,"" she said. See also: 3-D printing: the shape of things to come . The kit has been a hit with developers with downloads in the ""hundreds of thousands"" since its release 18 months ago, according to Microsoft. The company itself has been busy looking at ways to exploit the technology through its network of research laboratories around the world. At Microsoft Research's UK base in Cambridge, scientists are currently trialing a new imaging tool for surgeons. ""Touchless Interaction in Medical Imaging"" gives surgeons the power to manipulate scans and medical images on a computer screen using hand gestures. Doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and London's St Thomas' Hospital have been impressed with the equipment, says Helena Mentis, one of the Microsoft Research team working on the project. ""They've all been extremely excited to be able to have hands-on manipulation of imaging data that they are so reliant on, particularly with the push towards minimally invasive surgery,"" Mentis said. Watch video: Hands-free browsing using Kinect . Dr Tom Carrell, vascular surgeon at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, says Kinect has the potential to radically change surgery. ""With Kinect, we could revolutionize the way we do complex operations. Patients will spend less time in theater, and surgeons will be more in control of the information they need,"" Carrell said in a statement. Kinect's influence could extend further says Mentis, manipulating 3-D models of the brain for neurosurgery and expanding touchless interaction into a whole suite of surgical tools. Back in Southampton, the same optimism persists about the progress that can be made using Kinect for Windows. Metcalf predicts that a commercially viable tool for stroke patients will be achieved within five years and that this flurry of activity is only the beginning. ""The other work that's going on around the world in different domains means we can all learn from each other as well,"" she said. ""It just pushes the whole field forward.""",6,Technology
"(CNN) -- In 2007, at the dawn of the app market, few would have predicted the industry would soon become a billion dollar business. But thanks to the popularity of Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and other smartphone platforms, the app business is booming. Mobile phone apps are expected to generate $25 billion in worldwide sales in 2013, up 62% from last year, according to new research from Gartner Inc. The study was first reported by the Wall Street Journal Monday. The exponential growth mirrors that of smartphones -- for the first time this year, more smartphones are forecast to be shipped globally than feature phones, according to a report released Monday by IDC, the technology market research firm. IDC projects that vendors will ship 919 million smartphones this year -- 50.1% of total mobile phone shipments. ""Much of the world's smartphone shipments were a direct result of demand in mature economies such as the U.S.,"" IDC wrote. ""The balance of smartphone demand is gradually shifting, however, to emerging markets where smartphone user bases are still relatively small and economic prospects are considerably higher."" China is leading the charge in the developing world, passing the U.S. last month to become the world's top country for Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, according to Flurry Inc., a mobile analytics firm. That's helping to feed the app frenzy. Apple and Google now have more than 700,000 apps in their respective app stores. The time people spend using apps is growing, too. From December 2011 to December 2012, time spent by app users in the U.S. grew from 94 minutes to 127 minutes a day, according to Flurry. The new ""app economy"" has created about 466,000 jobs in the U.S. from 2007 to 2012, according to a study last year by TechNet. But the explosion of smartphone applications will likely decrease the odds for bedroom developers dreaming of app riches. ""You do still see the success stories but they are fewer and farther between,"" Mashable's Christine Warren told CNN. ""A lot of it has to do with luck,"" she said. ""Having a well-designed app, an app that works well with mobile so it takes advantage of the camera, it takes advantage of geolocation features, it can connect in with other apps and services -- that goes a long way. Catching the attention of the right websites and ""staying in the top 10, top 50 of the best selling list goes a long way toward long-term success,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Looks like it could take awhile for new Twitter user Rupert Murdoch to get the hang of things. For starters, the 80-year-old media mogul, who signed up for Twitter over the New Year's holiday, might want to make sure the people he follows are real. As of Monday, the oft-controversial Murdoch was following a grand total of four people on the social networking site. One of them, at first glance, appears to be Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page. Except that it's not Larry Page but a parody account that's part of a university project. ""This is a fake account - part of a series created for @plaidavenger's class at Virginia Tech,"" the owner of the account tweeted Monday in reply to a follower asking about it after seeing an interaction with Murdoch. It wasn't clear Monday whether the News Corporation CEO was aware of the misunderstanding. The Twitter chat started with ""Plaid Larry Page"" welcoming the magnate to the site. ""Welcome @rupertmurdoch to Twitter! Could Google+ be next?"" he wrote Sunday. Murdoch's reply: ""Maybe soon, but I'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what I may really say!"" Indeed. Less than a day into his Twitter tenure, Murdoch had been publicly chastised by what appeared to be his wife (fellow Twitter newbie Wendi Deng) for a tweet saying that ""maybe Brits have too many holidays for [a] broke country."" He quickly backed down, deleting the tweet in question. [UPDATE: Both Twitter and the account owner have acknowledged that the Deng account is a fake not really run by her. Twitter had mistakenly given the account ""verified"" status shortly after it was created.] . Murdoch tweets support for Rick Santorum . It's hard to figure out what to make of Murdoch's other three follows, other than that he appears to be taking his new venture into Web and social-media culture seriously. Some have ventured it's part of a ""charm offensive"" after a year in which he was embroiled in a phone-hacking controversy at his now-defunct ""News of the World"" newspaper. Alan Sugar, a British magnate and reality-TV judge, as well as Twitter nemesis of CNN's own Piers Morgan, is one of them. The other two are Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Zynga CEO Mark Pincus -- the man behind such online time-killers as ""FarmVille"" and ""Mafia Wars.""",6,Entertainment/Technology

Hiddink's contract with Russia expires on June 30, two weeks after the finals start, and he has a free period before taking over the reigns with Turkey in August. The Dutchman was also linked with the vacant Nigeria coaching role, which subsequently went to former Sweden manager Lars Lagerback, who signed a five-month contract on Friday. Hiddink recently revealed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who played for him in a brief spell while coaching English club Chelsea, had sounded him out about taking the job. ""The interest from Ivory Coast is real, but first I have to analyze the situation,"" Hiddink said. ""I need to solve some matters before making my decision. ""Drogba asked me in the name of the players to accept the invitation. The Ivorian federation is also very interested.""",7,Sports
"(CNN) -- Real Madrid, the kings of Europe, will take on a team living one of the greatest fairytale stories in Bulgarian football history. Ludogorets Razgrad, which clinched its place in the group stage of the Champions League for the first time following a dramatic penalty shootout playoff victory, will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to face the defending champion. Real, which defeated city rival Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon last year to win ""La Decima"" -- it's 10th title -- is attempting to become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League. Ludogorets will also face five-time champion Liverpool -- back in the Champions League after a five-year absence -- as well as Swiss side FC Basel in Group A. Ludogorets defeated Romanian side Steaua Bucharest thanks to two penalty saves from stand-in goalkeeper Cosmin MoÅ£i. MoÅ£i , a defender, went in goal for the shootout after goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off with one minute of extra time remaining and made himself a hero. Surprisingly Liverpool have won all three of their European Cup matches against 10-time champion Real and have never even conceded a goal against them. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich will face Manchester City in a repeat of last season's group stage contests. Munich produced a fine performance to win 3-1 in Manchester but was stunned by the English club at the Allianz Arena, losing 3-2 in the return fixture. ""We're coming up against familiar teams here,"" Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer told his club's website. ""They're not easy opponents by any means, but we know from last year where we stand and can use that going in."" Bayern and City will also have to negotiate tricky ties against Roma and CSKA Moscow if they are to progress. In Group F, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face two of his former clubs after Paris Saint-Germain was drawn alongside Barcelona and Ajax. PSG, beaten in the round of 16 by Chelsea last season, will also have to take on Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia. ""These are games where every team has the right to dream,"" Barcelona's director of sport, former Spanish international keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, told the club website. ""We have our dreams, and they all have their own."" It's a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu for Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund after the two teams were drawn together for a third consecutive season. Dortmund, which was narrowly beaten by Real Madrid in last year's quarterfinal, triumphed against Arsene Wenger's side in London but was topped at home by ""the Gunners."" Turkish side Galatasaray, which reached the second round last time around, will also provide a stern test, with Belgian club Anderlecht completing the line-up. Atletico Madrid, which lost last year's final in extra time, will face Italian champion Juventus, Olympiacos and Swedish side Malmo in Group A. Juventus crashed out in the group stage last season. Olympiacos was beaten by Manchester United in the last-16 during the previous edition while Malmo is making its first appearance in the group stage. In Group C, Benfica, which has not won the competition since 1962, takes on Zenit Saint Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Radamel Falcao's Monaco. Chelsea, the 2012 champion, will be confident of making it through Group G after being drawn against Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Slovenian champion Maribor. Athletic Bilbao's reward for defeating Napoli in the playoff are games against Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and BATE Borisov. Champions League draw: . Group A: Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Olympiacos, Malmo . Group B: Real Madrid, Basel, Liverpool, Ludogorets . Group C: Benfica, Zenit, Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco .

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Indian boy has batted his way into cricket history with a record-breaking innings of 498 in a school tournament in Mumbai, India. Armaan Jaffer, the nephew of former India international batsman Wasim Jaffer, hit the highest score ever made by a schoolboy in a local under-14 competition on Wednesday. It was only three runs short of the alltime first-class record set by West Indies star Brian Lara in 1994. Jaffer's huge total came from 490 balls, from which he hit 77 fours, and surpassed the 439 his Rizvi Springfield school teammate Sarfaraz Khan scored in 2009. Rizvi eventually declared on an intimidating 800-8, with opponents IES Raja Shivaji School on 52-2 in reply at the end of the second day's play. Despite his notable achievement, Jaffer expressed his regret that he was unable to reach 500 runs. ""I am a little disappointed that I missed the 500-mark but as we say, 'One mistake and you are back in the pavilion,' "" he said in quotes reported on the Cricinfo website. Jaffer and his teammates talk about his feat on YouTube . His uncle Wasim had previously broken the same record, but Jaffer insisted beating the landmark figure never crossed his mind and he thanked his coach Raju Pathak for his guidance during the innings. ""I was not thinking about any record, not about Sarfaraz's 439 and not even about Wasim uncle's 403. I was just following my coach's instructions. I am thankful to him for his motivation."" Pathak said he had given his batsman a free reign to play as he wished, having been on 295 when he resumed his innings. ""He is a very disciplined player,"" he said. ""I had told him last evening I want you to play a long innings, so go ahead and score as many runs you want. ""Based on your innings, we will declare the target. But he surprised me as well and created a record innings. I am very pleased with his game."" Like millions of young cricket hopefuls in India, there is one man who Jaffer hopes to emulate when he is older. ""Sachin Tendulkar is my idol. His determination and focus are the things that stand out.""",7,Sports

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki made it 13 straight wins in her home tournament in Copenhagen on Friday the 13th as she dispatched French hope Alize Cornet 6-0 6-3. The former world number one is bidding for her third straight title on the hard courts of the Farum Arena and has now won 19 straight sets without reply, dating back to the 2010 semifinals. The Danish top seed will take on Petra Martic Saturday for a place in the final. ""I played well. I got a lot of first serves in and I didnÂ´t make any unforced errors, which always helps, of course,"" Wozniacki told the official WTA website. Martic saw off Bojana Jovanovski 6-4 4-6 6-3 to make the semifinals in Copenhagen for the second year in a row.

"London (CNN) -- Never underestimate the power of visualization. ""I was always dreaming about being the best in tennis,"" said world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who became the first Open era player to win three consecutive Australian Open titles after beating Andy Murray 6-7 7-6 6-3 6-2 in Sunday's final. ""I remember as a kid, I was improvising and making little trophies out of different materials and going in front of the mirror, lifting the trophies and saying 'Nole was the champion!'"" The 25-year-old claimed an unprecedented third straight title in Melbourne and cemented his place among the game's all-time greats -- a feat all the more remarkable given the Serb's upbringing amid conflict in the Balkans during the 1990s. ""We didn't have a childhood that is similar to some of our generation of tennis players because we grew up during the war. There was a lot of struggle, difficulty financially ... but we survived,"" said Djokovic, referring to the three-year war which was the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. ""It was really hard to succeed and I have to thank God for the big support from my father and my mother and all the family,"" added Djokovic, who spoke to CNN's Open Court show during the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, prior to the start of the season's first grand slam in Australia. ""They believed in me and gave me hope when I was facing a lot of disbelief, a lot of doubts. Backed and also blessed with some impressive sporting genes -- father Srdjan and his uncle Goran were professional skiers -- Djokovic began his tennis odyssey at the age of four. ""I saw tennis on the TV and I saw the tennis court (near his parent's restaurant in Kapaonik, southern Serbia) and my father brought me a small tennis racket. That's when I think we all fell in love with the sport,"" he explained. It was here that Djokovic caught the eye his first coach Jelena Gencic. ""I knew that Nole would be the best in the world. ""Somebody asked him: 'Hey, boy! What do you want to be when you grow up?' (And he would reply): 'Be the first in pro-tennis.' He was six years old."" That almost in-bred ambition and winning mentality has brought him win four grand slam titles over the past two seasons -- notably claiming his first Wimbledon title in 2011 and his third Australian Open crown in the marathon six-hour final in Melbourne 12 months ago. ""Pressure is a privilege in a way and a big challenge for every professional athlete,"" said Djokovic. ""It's just a matter of understanding it, and maturing as a player and getting that necessary experience to use it at the right moments to cope,"" he says. ""It's a privilege because it means that you are doing something that counts. And all my life I have been dreaming to be the best in what I do and my dreams came true."" Last year, from a psychological standpoint, Djokovic had a lot to cope with. Along with epic victories on court came a great loss off it with the death of his grandfather, Vladimir last April. Further emotional strain followed in October when his father was hospitalized for a serious respiratory infection. But there were also more welcome distractions on tour. Aside from his celebrity status -- which he enjoys -- and a legion of fans who give him ""a lot of energy, positive vibrations and love,"" Djokovic plays mentor to his two brothers, 21-year-old Marko and Djordje who turns 18 in July. A regular presence in the crowd at grand slams, Djokovic's brothers are now making their way in the game. ""They have great ambitions and I'm happy and fortunate to be able to advise them on and off court with their game and with their psychology in some way if I can,"" said Djokovic, who is all too aware of the weight of expectation on his siblings' shoulders given their big brother is world No. 1. ""Everybody expects them to play well and to do even better ... but each one has an individual path that they have to respect and I'm trying to help."" As Djokovic concedes, having three brothers away from home, is hard for their mother Dijana. ""It's definitely heartbreaking for (her) to see all three sons go away and none of us live in Serbia ... but (my parents) understand this is the life we have chosen and they respect our decision,"" said the Australian Open finalist. While Djokovic continues to turn his childhood dreams into spectacular reality, it's clear no matter where he finds himself in the world, his values and heart remain as close to home as ever. ""I try to stay humble as much as I can because I want to have the most important, most valuable people in my life around me like family and friends. They are the ones who actually keep me grounded and focused on what I do.""",7,Sports
"(CNN) -- The streets of Berlin have turned black, red and gold as up to a million flag-waving fans gather in the German capital to welcome home the nation's World Cup-winning footballers. Germany's national side flew in from Rio de Janeiro -- where they beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time on Sunday to secure their fourth championship -- on Tuesday morning to a heroes' welcome. Mario GÃ¶tze (@MarioGoetze), who scored the winning goal at the Maracana, tweeted a photo of the team on the bus from the plane to the airport terminal, announcing that they had arrived home. Boarding an open-top Mercedes truck and trailer emblazoned with the years of their four World Cup victories -- 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014 -- the team threaded its way through the city along roads lined with tens of thousands of cheering fans. The players, dressed in black t-shirts, each bearing a large number 1, and proudly displaying their winners' medals, waved to those below, who held aloft cardboard signs proclaiming ""We are all world champions!"" Stars including a grinning Mesut Ã–zil (@MesutOzil1088) tweeted photos of themselves taken from the trailer and marveled at the huge number of supporters who had turned out to greet them: ""What a crowd!"" the Arsenal midfielder posted. ""Unbelievable!"" One enthusiastic fan displayed a banner announcing to the team's goalkeeper: ""Neuer, I want to have your baby."" Others rode their bikes alongside the vehicle, wearing German flags as capes and snapping photos on their phones as they cycled towards the city center. At the Brandenburg Gate there was a festive atmosphere, as the sea of supporters -- many of whom had taken the day off to be there -- waited patiently for hours for a glimpse of the team. ""We're so incredibly proud,"" one woman told CNN. ""It's a great day for Germany. I'm a waitress but I wouldn't have missed today - everyone is off work!"" For others, a trip to the ""Fanmeile"" fans' zone was ""The best lunchbreak of all time."" Some had traveled long distances to join in the celebrations. ""We've come from Frankfurt this morning,"" another fan explained. ""We arrived at 4.30 a.m. -- we just had to come. I'm proud to be German, I'm looking forward to seeing my favorite player Schweinsteiger on stage."" Those who couldn't be there in person took part on Twitter, with Alex (@pixxelrunner) tweeting from Hamburg that he had ""goosebumps"" watching the ""craziness"" unfold in Berlin. The crowds erupted in huge cheers as the team finally took to the stage -- several hours later than expected, because of their slow progress on the 11km route through the jammed city streets. Dancing, clowning around, playing air guitar and singing ""We are number one!"" the players thanked the crowd for their support. Captain Philipp Lahm showed off the trophy, passing it to his fellow players, including midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, draped in a German flag and beaming, despite the large plaster covering the cut to his face sustained in Sunday's final. Tweeting a photograph of several members of the team in front of thousands of fans, Ã–zil thanked the huge numbers who had joined the street party -- which looked set to go on throughout the day and well into the night.

"(CNN) -- Ahdaf Soueif isn't in one place for long. She has spent the last month touring India and Australia, and is back in her native Egypt for a few days before heading to London. She is in demand for speaking engagements, particularly at literary festivals, to help the world understand political events in Egypt, still in turmoil more than two years after its revolution. Soueif, 62, is a Booker-shortlisted author and political commentator whose most recent book ""Cairo: My City, Our Revolution"" gives a personal account of her involvement with the protests in January 2011 that led to the downfall of former president Hosni Mubarak. Soueif is not one for commentating from a safe distance. On the day before we speak, she has yet again joined protesters on the streets of Cairo. ""I came straight from the airport to the streets,"" she said. On January 25, 2011, when hundreds of thousands of protests began flooding into Tahrir Square in Cairo, Soueif was at a literary festival in Jaipur, India. ""I did my final event and then went sightseeing and shopping in Jaipur,"" she said. ""When I got back to my hotel I had I don't know how many messages, so I turned on the TV and saw what was happening in Tahrir Square."" She had been planning to spend another 10 days in India, but instead got the first flight back to Cairo to join the demonstrations. In her book, Soueif describes euphoria in joining the demonstrations with her two young nieces. ""It was grassroots, millions of people walking out,"" she said. ""It was amazing and totally inclusive."" For Soueif, the revolution that began in January 2011 is still a work in progress, because despite free presidential elections in June 2012, there have not been the changes in social justice that many were hoping for. Despite the setbacks and continuing violence, Soueif is adamant the country is better off than it was before 2011. ""I'm very optimistic,"" she said. ""The change that has happened in people was huge. People have broken free and expressed what they want."" Soueif said she joins protesters on the streets of Cairo two or three times a week when she is not traveling the globe on speaking engagements. ""It gets tiring, but at the same time it's re-energizing because there's a tremendous positive energy flowing,"" she said. ""It reminds you what it's all about and of the determination of people."" Soueif was born in Cairo to intellectual parents and spent her childhood between the United Kingdom and Egypt. She studied English literature at university in Cairo before researching a PhD in Britain. She married the late British poet Ian Hamilton, with whom she had two sons, Omar Robert Hamilton and Ismail Richard Hamilton. Soueif has written two novels, several collections of short stories, a book of essays and edited a hefty tome an Islamic art. Her second novel ""The Map of Love"" in 1993 made her the first Muslim woman to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. ""What it meant to me wasn't just about being the first Muslim woman or Arab, it was just great as a writer to make an impact,"" she said. ""Map of Love"" was translated into 28 languages, with the Arabic translation by her own mother. ""It was a tremendous privilege to work with her. She was incredible,"" said Soueif. ""We had some rows to begin with along the lines of 'whose book is it anyway?', but it was a very rich experience. ""I still remember the times when we would sit and mull over the right translation for a certain expression for hours."" In recent years, Soueif has been too busy as a columnist and commentator to write fiction, although hopes to write another novel when she can find time. Last year she was listed by Arabian Business magazine among its 100 most powerful Arab women. She is currently working on her own Arabic translation of her Cairo book, but is struggling to find time in her busy schedule. ""If I get two clear hours, that's what I work on,"" she said. Ahdaf Soueif will be appearing at the Women of the World Festival at London's Southbank Centre from March 8-10.",7,Arts & Culture
"(CNN) -- Roger Federer fended off an audacious comeback by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to win the ATP World Tour Finals for a record sixth time in London Sunday. A pumped up Federer wrapped up a 6-3 7-6 6-3 victory over Tsonga in his 100th career final to end 2011 on a conspicuous high note. Consecutive titles in Basel, Paris, where he also beat Tsonga in the final, and at the season-ending championships have seen the Swiss maestro reclaim the No.3 spot in the world from Britain's Andy Murray. But he had to withstand a mid-match onslaught from his French opponent, who broke Federer as he served for the match at a set and 5-4 to the good. Tsonga also saved a match point in the second set tiebreaker before leveling at one set all. But as in the first set, Federer broke Tsonga again in the eighth game of the decider and made no mistake when he served for the championship for the second time. ""I couldn't be more happy my season ends this way. I'm exhausted, Jo sapped every last energy out of me today,"" Federer said. His triumph lifted the Swiss maestro out of a tie with Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras for titles at the ATP's end-of-season finale. It was his 70th career crown. It will also compensate for failing to add to his 16 grand slam crowns this season as Novak Djokovic, who failed to make it out of the round robin group stages in London, dominated with three. Rafael Nadal, who beat Federer in the final to win the French Open title, was also eliminated at that stage as he lost to Tsonga in a deciding match.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hailed as India's greatest actor, he's the legendary star of Sholay and leader of the mighty Bachchan clan. CNN talked to Amitabh Bachchan, the De Niro of Bollywood, at an International Indian Film Academy event in London... ......................................... Amitabh Bachchan talks to Myleene on the green carpet at the Indian Film Awards in Yorkshire, England . CNN: Right now, it's an exciting time for Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan: Yes, I think it is. It's a great progression from where we were a few years ago, where even though we were the highest-making film nation in the world, we were looked upon with a certain amount of criticism and skepticism about our content and the way we make our films. Gradually, over the years, people have come to expect and accept that this is how we make the films, and it's all turning out to be profitable and exciting with viewers all over the world. CNN: Why do you think people had been so skeptical? Bachchan: Well, they felt that the content wasn't exciting enough, they couldn't understand the song and dance routine, they didn't like the very cliched stories or formulaic storylines, but that's the way we are. We must have song and dance in our lives; we've had it ever since the inception of cinema in India. Our stories are very social-based, very human-based. We are a very emotional nation. All our culture and tradition of over 5,000 years has come through a lot of heat and fire and eventually come out on top. That's how it is, and that's how it's going to remain. CNN: Is Bollywood escapism for the Indian people? Bachchan: You have to see it in a larger perspective. There are large numbers of people in India below the poverty line, there are large numbers of people who lead a meager existence. They want to find a little escape from the hardships of life, and come and watch something colorful and exciting and musical. Indian cinema provides that. So yes, the content of our television and our cinema is escapist in nature because we are there to provide entertainment. The select group of people who do make realistic cinema, who do make cinema perhaps a little more acceptable to the Western audience, is a very small percentage. CNN: What are the main differences between a Hollywood and a Bollywood actor? Bachchan: Conceptually we are both the same. We are all human beings, we are actors, we are put in different situations and conditions and we act. Perhaps the content of the Indian cinema is a lot more varied and diverse as compared to the ones the Hollywood actors get associated with. They more or less have a very single track presence, so to say. Indian actors, because of the format of our stories, need to be good actors, and be able to perform emotional sequences, do a bit of comedy, dance and singing, action, because all of this forms just one film. In many ways I'd say there are greater demands on Indian actors than there are on Hollywood. CNN: So do you think Hollywood actors could learn from the Bollywood actors? Bachchan: I don't know that we are worthy enough for learning something from us, but I do know that actors in India are very capable, very talented, and can be compared to the best anywhere in the world. CNN: What makes you the best actor in India? Bachchan: I don't use any techniques; I'm not trained to be an actor. I just enjoy working in films. It's more instinctive rather than anything else. I don't do the calculated rehearsed kind of approach, and I hope that I can continue that because I believe that instinct is much stronger and greater when you are performing on camera. CNN: Tell us about the upcoming remake of ""Sholay."" Bachchan: ""Sholay"" is an extraordinary film. It's the highest-grossing film and it had a great impact on our society. Obviously remaking it is a huge task. We are purely using the inspiration of the film. I am playing the baddie in the film, as opposed to one of the leading men in the original. It's a great challenge for any actor to do something different in a film. I will obviously not be playing the leading man, but it's exciting. At my age you don't get to run after the girl and win them over and fight the baddie, but I'm happy that I'm doing the negative role in this film and I'm enjoying it! CNN: Tell us about ""Sarkar 2"" -- it's becoming a bit of a family affair! Bachchan: It's a very powerful film, it takes influences from the Godfather. It's not exactly a remake, but it took inspiration from the Godfather and put it in ""Sarkar."" We are now doing ""Sarkar 2,"" which is going to have Abhishek, my son, and his wife to be, so I think it will be wonderful for the three of us to work together again. Sarkar 2 will be a much larger film, larger in concept, larger in visuals. It promises to be very exciting. CNN: Is it nice to work with your family? Bachchan: The entire filming industry in India is one big family. We all feel that way whenever we make a film: it's a very homely feeling; we all live together, eat together, move around together. It's a wonderful feeling. I don't know how Hollywood behaves, but this is how we behave, and yes, when you have members of the family working with you it makes it all the more exciting. CNN: What's next for you? Bachchan: I think that it's important that actors keep getting challenged every day. For every creative person it's a terrible moment when they say they have done all they want to do. I like to feel the butterflies in the stomach, I like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how I'm going to be able to accomplish this feat, get jittery. That hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people. I'd like to believe that tomorrow is another challenge for me. I'm sure there is lots more for me to do, because there is lots and lots of stuff still to be explored. E-mail to a friend .",7,Entertainment
"(CNN) -- She was getting out of the car one autumn day in 2009, about to have lunch with a colleague, when Este Osofsky-McGonigle felt something pop in her neck. ""It was something so strong I couldn't talk for a couple of minutes,"" recalls the New York school psychologist. But it passed, and she regained her speech. The rest of the day and night elapsed normally, but at 9:30 the next morning, as Osofsky-McGonigle finished up a meeting at work, her right arm went numb. She went into her office and tried to write a letter, ""Dear So-and-So."" But when she picked up the pen and tried to write the letter ""D,"" the pen just slid across the paper. Osofsky-McGonigle tried again, but the same thing happened. ""The 'D' went crazy,"" she said. Fortunately, Osofsky-McGonigle could still run -- and she did, running the whole length of the school building, seeking a friend who sent her to the school nurse. The nurse checked for a pulse in Osofsky-McGonigle's right arm, but found none. By the time she reached the hospital 15 minutes later, she could not lift her right arm or leg, speak or understand words. Osofsky-McGonigle, at 47 and in near-perfect health, was having a stroke. What happens during a stroke . The ""pop"" she felt in her neck the day before was her carotid artery tearing, a rare event called a carotid dissection. The carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood to the brain. A blood clot formed after the dissection, and a piece of it likely broke off and traveled into an artery in her brain, blocking blood supply and resulting in an ischemic stroke, explained Dr. Daniel Antoniello, the attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center who treated Osofsky-McGonigle. Ischemic stroke, which results from a blocked blood vessel, is the most common type of stroke and represents about 87% of all strokes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hemorrhagic strokes, which involve bleeds in the brain, make up the remainder. Most of the 800,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year occur among people age 65 and older, the CDC says. Unfortunately, doctors are seeing more and more strokes in younger people, partly because of the continuing epidemic of childhood obesity, early onset diabetes and cholesterol and hypertension issues, said Antoniello. No one knows why Osofsky-McGonigle's artery tore, especially at such a young age. She had not suffered a recent injury, nor did she have any traditional risk factors for vascular disease such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. She may have simply been unlucky -- but after that, she was as lucky as any stroke survivor could be. Timing is the main factor determining whether a person lives or dies -- or lives with a severe disability -- after a stroke. May is National Stroke Awareness Month. Thanks to the alert school nurse, Osofsky-McGonigle made it to the emergency room about an hour and 20 minutes after her first symptoms. That left doctors plenty of time to administer the only approved treatment for ischemic stroke -- a clot-busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. Generally speaking, tPA is only effective and only given within a 4.5-hour time window after stroke symptoms appear, said Antoniello. About an hour after that, Osofsky-McGonigle underwent a procedure in which doctors threaded a catheter through an artery in her groin all the way up into her brain. Once the catheter reached the clot, doctors squirted more tPA directly into the clot. Stroke victims don't call 911, delay crucial treatment . ""That dissolved the clot and restored blood flow,"" Antoniello said. Still, no one knew how well Osofsky-McGonigle would recover. After the procedure, she was in intensive care. The next day, she still couldn't speak or understand anything. On the second day, when Antoniello asked her to name some simple objects in her hospital room -- a pen, glasses, a watch -- she could not utter the words. ""She would try, but a jumbled mess would come out,"" he said. Osofsky-McGonigle had aphasia, a common outcome of stroke in which parts of the brain related to language, including reading, writing and talking, are damaged. Although some people experience a full recovery from aphasia, others only get part of their previous abilities back. How well a person recovers from stroke is highly variable and highly individual, Antoniello said. By the third day, though, Osofsky-McGonigle, who was also starting to move her right arm and leg, could name one or two simple items -- and her recovery took off from there. She was moved to a rehabilitation facility. At first, she made mistakes identifying family and friends, but soon could state who everyone was. ""That was a big promotion for me,"" she said. As soon as she got home, she said, she was bossing her husband, Ray, and son Zachary around. ""I said, 'Zachary, get the radio off,' but it was the TV I was talking about, so he said, 'It's the TV, not the radio.' I said, 'OK, get the TV off.' Osofsky-McGonigle started driving again and went back to work in early December 2009, a mere five weeks after her stroke. By any standard, she experienced an astounding recovery. ""It is absolutely remarkable that someone like her had such a severe impairment and then went back to work as a psychologist two months later,"" Antoniello said. ""There are not many people that make recoveries like her."" Once blood flow was restored, the damaged parts of Osofsky-McGonigle's brain started to ""come back on board,"" he said. Later on, different parts of her brain may have rewired for any areas that were permanently damaged. Today, she shows no evidence of a speech impairment. She attributes much of her recovery to determination. ""I couldn't afford to deteriorate,"" she said. ""I had a lot of things in my life lined up and I couldn't afford to be in any way less than what I was."" Robotic system may help stroke patients .",8,Health
"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- ""It was killing people, and I wanted to do something about it."" Bambi Gaddist's nonprofit has provided free HIV tests to more than 8,600 people since 2000. That realization about the AIDS crisis propelled Bambi Gaddist into activism in South Carolina more than 20 years ago, and she's been relentless in her fight to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS there ever since. One of the most effective tools in her arsenal? A large white RV. With ""GET TESTED"" written in bold letters on its side, the camper van is the mobile unit of the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council, a nonprofit that Gaddist helped start and has headed since 1995. The only unit of its kind in South Carolina, the van brings confidential HIV testing and information to communities across the state. Since 2000, Gaddist's organization has provided HIV tests to more than 8,600 people, free of charge. Gaddist says the face of AIDS has changed since the mid-1980s, when she helped run one of the first grass-roots AIDS awareness campaigns in Columbia, South Carolina, while pursuing her doctorate in public health. ""In the '80s, HIV was seen as a gay, white male disease,"" Gaddist said. ""Here in South Carolina, it became an African-American disease."" In 2006, African-Americans accounted for 76 percent of the new AIDS cases diagnosed in South Carolina, and the state ranked ninth in the nation for those living with the disease, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. iReport.com: Share stories of being black in America . Statistics like these are what drives Gaddist and her staff. The mobile unit hits the road at least two to three times a week, and Gaddist says it goes just about anywhere -- gay and straight nightclubs, housing projects, health fairs or churches. ""We refuse to be quiet. That's what's going to save the lives of our children: talking about it and not hiding it,"" Gaddist said. At outreach events, staffers distribute free condoms and information while trying to recruit people to be tested. Eight to 15 people usually take the 10-minute test at every event. Someday, Gaddist hopes, HIV tests will be as common as breast cancer exams or skin cancer screenings.  Watch Gaddist and her team in action outside a nightclub » . ""We're trying to normalize this,"" Gaddist said. ""[We want] anyone, regardless of who they are, to say, 'I need to know my status.' "" Gaddist believes that the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS has contributed to people's ignorance about the virus and to its alarming spread throughout the state. ""After 27 years of AIDS, we are still combating a mentality of fear and shame,"" she said. In response, Gaddist has recruited powerful allies to her cause: South Carolina's churches. Since 2006, Gaddist's group has run a program that educates local pastors about the disease and teaches them how to do outreach in their communities. Gaddist has gotten 30 churches on board. She believes that this isn't just spreading much-needed awareness; it's helping reshape public attitudes.  Watch Gaddist describe how churches have gotten involved with her cause » . ""People still believe that you get [HIV/AIDS] from touching someone, from hugging someone,"" Gaddist said. ""The first arm of defense against this disease is to educate them."" In the past, Gaddist says, some churches helped perpetuate the stigma about the disease. ""[But] now more than ever before, the church holds a solution to the HIV/AIDS epidemic,"" she said. Gaddist has helped her organization grow from a two-person operation to a 23-member staff. In addition to testing and counseling, the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council provides case management for people living with HIV and runs several programs targeting at-risk populations. Still, for all she's done, Gaddist can't imagine a time when she'll ever stop doing this work.  Watch Gaddist explain how the mobile outreach unit works with the community » . ""I joke about being a 70-year-old woman giving out condoms,"" she said. Knowing how many people are at risk is what keeps Gaddist motivated.

"(CNN) -- Tony Dorsett recalls a 1984 game against the Philadelphia Eagles when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him. One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. ""He blew me up,"" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit."" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football . However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the ""holy grail"" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. ""We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,"" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. ""This is very, very preliminary,"" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. ""There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?"" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. ""Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,"" he said. ""Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there."" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL . Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. ""And I say who are you? What are you becoming?"" he said. ""It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato."" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players . Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. ""I'm going to beat this. Trust me,"" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a $765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. ""I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way."" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. NFL concussion settlement raises questions .",8,Sports
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Steve Karas and Matthew Welling share a special bond. Matthew Welling, left, received a bone marrow transplant from Steve Karas, right. They aren't related. In fact, they had never even met until 3-year-old Matthew needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant two years ago. It turned out that Karas, 51, of Newton, Massachusetts, was a perfect match. ""My heart went a hundred miles an hour, and I couldn't even conceive of what this meant,"" Karas recalled. He had signed up for the National Marrow Donor Program registry 17 years ago and had never given it another thought. The call to donate came out of the blue. Karas remembered hearing, ""It was a little 1-year-old boy with this horrible disease called osteopetrosis, and the only cure was a bone marrow transplant, and would I be willing?"" He said there was no other answer than ""of course."" Karas is one of 11 million Americans who have volunteered to be marrow donors. Every day in the United States, an estimated 6,000 people need a transplant. There are two ways to donate bone marrow: Either a doctor must insert a needle into the back of the hip bone to retrieve the marrow, or cells are collected through a procedure called peripheral blood stem cell donation, or PBSC. ""Bone marrow is the source of early blood stem cells, and they make all kinds of blood cells that fight infection,"" said Dr. Ann Haight, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at the Aflac Cancer Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Bone marrow transplants can help treat cancers such as leukemia and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease. Matthew was suffering from a rare disorder that increases the density of bones and crowds out bone marrow.  Watch more on bone marrow donation » . His father, Michael, said waiting for doctors to find a donor match was terrifying. ""There is no more difficult, hard-to-stomach feeling than watching your child be sick and suffering and not be able to do anything,"" he said. Welling said his ailing son started turning the corner after receiving a transplant in November 2007. Doctors told him that Karas' bone marrow donation helped save Matthew's life by stopping the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, Matthew developed an infection a month after the transplant and the cells stopped working. He required a second transplant from another donor. That transplant worked, and while Matthew still suffers from side effects, his father reported the boy is cured of his initial disease. But the story doesn't end there. Karas' boss, Paul Amos, got word of his good deed and was so inspired that he launched a bone marrow registry drive among his 4,000 employees at Aflac, a supplemental insurance company based in Columbus, Georgia. As of Friday, nearly 1,100 workers had volunteered to join the national registry. ""We're not asking for money,"" Amos said. ""we're not asking for any additional time except for a couple of seconds on a coffee break. Think of all the things you've ever given, and that's the simplest you could ever give."" Joining the registry involves completing a donation kit (available at marrow.org). Cotton swabs are swiped on the inside of the cheeks to determine the tissue type. The sample is then sent along with an in-depth health history questionnaire to the National Marrow Donor Program. Dr. Haight said anyone over the age of 18 can join the registry provided he or she meets the health criteria. Those with conditions such as HIV, insulin-dependent diabetes, hepatitis and autoimmune diseases are generally excluded. ""The biggest need we have for additional donors is in racial and ethnic minorities,"" she said. ""That's because transplant tissue type will run with your racial and ethnic background. ... We need more African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics."" Karas found the actual harvest process to be relatively simple, with little pain. He ended up donating through the PBSC process, a nonsurgical outpatient procedure. The donor's blood is removed through an intravenous needle and passed through a machine that separates out blood-forming cells. The remaining blood is returned through a needle in the donor's other arm. ""I felt like I had the flu, and those symptoms lasted three or four days,"" he said. Karas went back to work as a sales coordinator at the Boston, Massachusetts, office of Aflac within days. About a year ago, he received another call out of the blue and was asked if he wanted to meet Matthew and his parents. Michael Welling said the reunion was filled with tears. ""There was a part of us that felt, 'I almost hope he thinks we were worthy of this unbelievable gift he gave us.' "" Karas reassured the family that there was never a doubt his mind, especially after seeing that Matthew was healthy and thriving. ""It was one of the most emotional moments of my life,"" Karas said. ""Short of fathering my own three sons, clearly this is the greatest thing I've ever been able to do.""",8,Health
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor checked out of a Los Angeles hospital ""sore, but intact,"" the actress said in an online message posted Friday evening. Elizabeth Taylor posted on her Twitter account that she was grieving for her close friend Michael Jackson. Taylor, 77, used her Twitter handle, @DameElizabeth, to tell fans that she was home, just as she did last week to announce she would go into a hospital to ""to complete a test I was in the middle of."" Her publicist this week denied tabloid rumors that her hospitalization was brought on by her grief over the sudden death of her close friend Michael Jackson in June. Taylor, in her latest tweets, addressed her sadness over Jackson's death: . ""I'm home from the hospital sore, but intact. Of course I'm still grieving for Michael ... I always will."" ""But as I said before I went into the hospital, 'I am a survivor,'"" Taylor tweeted. ""I've had many tragedies in my life, but I guess they have all taught me something. I have to look at it that way."" ""I have to be stronger and more appreciative of what I do have."" ""I give love and I'm surrounded by love ... and I thank God for that."" Twitter is a social networking site that allows users to update what they are doing using 140 characters or less. Taylor regularly posts short messages to her 116,000 Twitter followers through the account she opened earlier this year at the suggestion of her close friend, author and actress Kathy Ireland, publicist Dick Guttman said. She posted emotional messages earlier this month to counter rumors about how she was dealing with the news of Jackson's death. ""Although my grief over Michael could not be any deeper, I am not on suicide watch as some of the cheaper 'rags' would have you believe,"" Taylor tweeted July 5. A New York Post column published Tuesday quoted an unidentified source saying she was hospitalized because the ""heart's gone out of her"" after Jackson's death. Taylor, who uses a wheelchair because of scoliosis, or abnormal curving of the spine, gave fans several days advance notice of her hospitalization.

"(CNN) -- A 1-year-old child whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die will likely have an operation to allow the insertion of a breathing tube by the end of the week, his new hospital said. Joseph Maraachli, widely known in the media as Baby Joseph, is being evaluated by doctors at SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, hospital spokesman Bob Davidson said. The hospital had planned to have a press conference on Tuesday but canceled it ""because there is not yet a firm treatment plan,"" he said in a statement late Monday. But the head of pediatrics at the hospital, Robert Wilmott, expects a tracheotomy to go ahead by the end of the week, the statement said. A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck. A tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs, creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator, and is more comfortable for the child, the statement said. Joseph, who has a deteriorating neurological condition, was transferred to Cardinal Glennon Sunday from a hospital in London, Ontario. Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada since October. His doctor, in court papers, said that ""all cranial nerve functions are now absent"" and there is no hope for recovery. He recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, sought instead to have their son receive a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation so that he could be transferred home, where he would be cared for by his family. The child's aunt, Samar Nadar, has said that in 2002 the Maraachlis' daughter died at home with a tracheotomy after suffering a similar condition. In January, a Canadian Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the hospital, saying it could remove the child's breathing tube without a replacement, and issue a do-not-resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care. The Maraachlis fought to have their son relocated to a U.S hospital for a second opinion. The hospital in Canada said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. In a statement on the hospital's website, it says Joseph's transfer on Sunday happened ""despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts."" The Maraachli case gained the attention of pro-life groups including Priests for Life and the Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network, who organized prayer vigils and rallies in support of the family. In February, the hospital began receiving threats and increased security to protect its staff. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer. He issued a news release saying: ""After around-the-clock negotiations, this really became a race against time."" Joseph ""needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line,"" he said. CNN Medical Producer Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.",8,Health
"(CNN)  -- The woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal, doctors warned Wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care. The bathroom used by Elizabeth Fritzl, who was held captive for more than two decades, and her three children. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Hans-Heinz Lenze, the head of local social services said the family was ""doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances"" and said any change of identity would be the family's decision. Elizabeth Fritzl -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged, handcuffed and locked up by her father, Josef Fritzl, as an 18-year-old. Repeatedly raped, she gave birth to seven children by Fritzl, one of whom died as an infant. Three of the children -- Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5 -- remained imprisoned underground with their mother. The other three lived in an apartment upstairs with Fritzl and his wife who believed Elizabeth had abandoned them after running away from home. Elizabeth and five of the children were continuing to receive treatment at a local clinic near Amstetten after being reunited on Sunday. Kerstin, whose hospitalization at the weekend finally brought the family's plight to the attention of authorities, remained in a coma at a nearby hospital. ""It is astonishing how easy it worked that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together,"" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said. But Kepplinger warned that the family would require extensive counseling. ""We're talking of 20 years of darkness, incest and its effects and other illnesses they might have suffered from."" Kepplinger said the two sets of children were tentatively getting to know one another, adding that the two boys who had lived underground had an unusual way of communicating with each other. A policeman who had accompanied the boys to hospital after their discovery on Sunday said the pair had ""screamed with excitement"" during the car journey as they experienced the outside world for the first time. ""The two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before,"" said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz. ""The real world was completely alien to them... We had to drive very slowly with them because they cringed at every car light and every bump. It was as if we had just landed on the moon."" In an interview with the Austrian newspaper, Oesterreich, psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences. Another psychologist, Bernd Prosser, told Austrian television that it would be impossible for the four held prisoner underground to lead normal lives. ""I am afraid it is too late for that."" Kampusch, the Austrian girl abducted as a 10-year-old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007, also offered her help to the family on Tuesday, but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care. ""Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them,"" said Kampusch, now 20, in an interview with Austrian TV station Puls 4. ""I believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were, but that was probably impossible. This case is not like mine, where that was not my environment. They were born there and I can imagine that there is a strong attachment to that place."" E-mail to a friend .",8,National News
"London, England (CNN) -- The British government has apologized and offered compensation to hundreds of people who suffered the effects of thalidomide, a drug once prescribed to pregnant women that later was linked to major birth defects. Thalidomide sufferers and campaigners hailed the move and said it was long overdue. British doctors prescribed thalidomide for expectant mothers from 1958 to 1962 to control the symptoms of morning sickness. The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death. Thalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims. Doctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter. There are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust. One of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs. ""It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,"" she told CNN about the government's apology. ""There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die."" Medus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled ""No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On."" Health Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a £20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older. ""The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,"" O'Brien said in the House of Commons. ""We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis."" The problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said. That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards. The Thalidomide Society, which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims, said it welcomed the government's apology. ""I think it obviously makes a great deal of difference (to the children), but I think also for the parents who had dreadful, dreadful trouble in the very early years to convince people that something had happened and it wasn't their fault,"" said society secretary Vivien Kerr. ""For them, I think, it's something to be very grateful for and it's welcome."" CNN's Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",8,Health
"(CNN) -- Florida health officials say they've confirmed eight cases of dengue fever. Those infected have no history of recent international travel, the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday, ""so exposure was likely from local mosquitoes."" The cases were reported in two southeastern Florida counties: Martin and Miami-Dade. Dengue acquired from local mosquitoes is rare in the United States, Florida health officials said, urging residents to take steps such as wearing repellent to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say dengue rarely occurs in the United States. But this isn't the first time Florida has dealt with dengue. In 2009 and 2010, officials documented 28 locally acquired cases in Key West.

The Louisville, Kentucky, electrician was working full time and undergoing four-hour stints of dialysis three nights a week to stay alive while he waited for a transplant. On January 16, 2014, Ashley overheard her mother telling her grandmother about Danny. The young man and his mother had just been on a Louisville radio talk show sharing their story. None of his family members had been eligible to donate their kidneys, and the anonymous donors who volunteered weren't compatible. Ashley immediately felt compassion for this soft-spoken stranger.

Before she had heard Danny's story, she was always signed up to donate her organs after her death, but she had never considered being a living organ donor. Danny had Type O blood, meaning he could only be matched with a Type O donor. She knew she had the right blood type. She would need to undergo a series of other blood tests, physical and psychological exams to see if she was eligible to give Danny a kidney. Ashley and Danny were deemed a perfect match for the transplant. What are the odds that they would fall in love? ""Never in a million years did I think it would be a perfect match all the way around and end up like this,"" Ashley said. Danny's mom, Denise Stutzenberger, says even before she met Ashley, she was convinced her son would end up marrying her. ""I told her, 'You are going to be my daughter-in-law, you just don't know it yet,' "" she said. ""I don't know how to explain it. Something in me told me."" More than 100,000 Americans need a kidney, and fewer than 17,000 people receive one each year, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Less than 6,000 of those come from living donors -- and fewer than 200 living donors are like Ashley, with no connection or relation to the person in need. Ashley didn't want to meet Danny or his family until she found out it was a go. ""She was so scared that she was going to let us down. All I wanted to do was hug her. She was our angel,"" Danny's mom said. The two families grew close in the months leading up to the transplant on April 17 at the University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington. The night before their surgeries, Danny gave Ashley a musical jewelry box inscribed with the words, ""Ashley, you're an angel ... Danny."" It played ""I'll Be There"" by the Jackson Five. Memorial Day weekend, with the transplant behind them, the couple sensed they had a deeper connection but proceeded cautiously. ""We both agreed we did not want to mess up the relationship between us or our families, because by that time we were connected for life,"" she said. On June 5, Danny asked Ashley to be his girlfriend. They've been inseparable ever since and are expecting a girl, Berkli, in June. Danny proposed on Christmas. Ashley does most of the talking; she's the one who gives you a sense of their love. Danny isn't really one to talk about his feelings. ""I guess you can say we just fell in love,"" he said. ""I told her I wanted to be with her forever."" Danny will take anti-rejection medication for the rest of his life, but he said he's healthy now. Ashley's kidney won't last forever, however. Whenever it fails, in an estimated 20 to 30 years, ""I will be doing whatever I can to help him get a new one,"" she said. ""I wish I had 50 kidneys to give him."" Ashley says it's been a whirlwind romance. ""I feel like my feet haven't touched the ground,"" she said. ""It's just been an incredible, unexpected, serendipitous journey.""",8,Human Interest
